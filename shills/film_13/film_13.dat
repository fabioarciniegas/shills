If you don't like this, blame Canada.
My friend came over to my house and hadn't seen this so I obviously had to show it to him
So stupid it's funny. Immature humor, but great soundtrack.
It's purile, the animation sucks, and it could probably offend most minority groups. But my God is it funny!! I would seriously rank it alongside Life of Brian. And as a musical it could easily mix with the finest theatre productions with song structures to die for. The plot is tight and fast paced too. It's Satan (and Sadaam) that crack me up each time. And the song "Up There" is just perfect. There seems to be a little detail to enjoy afresh each time too. I may never get tired of this film.
One of the best musical films of the last 30 years. I’m not even joking. This movie is clever, hilarious and a damn good time. Gotta love South Park.
When I was in fifth grade, the principal of my school sent a letter home to our parents warning them not to let their kids watch South Park. I think I watched South Park for the first time that week. Since then, I’ve seen a handful of episodes. It’s always funny, but I’ve never been a big fan and will go years without watching the show. That being said, Bigger, Longer, and Uncut is pretty fuckin’ funny, mkay.
This film has taught me the most important lesson about life: blame Canada for everything. I spilled my drink, blame Canada. My dog chewed on my shoes, blame Canada. Canada has just been nuked, blame Canada.
"Off to the movies we shall go Where we learn everything that we know  Cus' the movies teach us what our parents don't have time to say!!!!!" Still fantastic. I miss old school South Park.
Even though I rewatched this last week, I found myself humming the songs to myself nonstop since I watched it. So I thought why not? Let's do this again. And man, this movie is ten million times better than it needed to be. I'm sure most would've been happy with a version of this movie that was just an extended episode, but it's so much more than that. Anyone who looks at this and thinks it's just a bunch of swear words and toilet humor is full of shit. Sure it has that, but it has so much heart and wit to go along with the vulgarity. Despite the crude animation, each frame is filled with clever details and funny Easter eggs that add to the scene rather than just being there for fans to recognize. And while the references are dated, the film's conflict and message is timeless and has aged far better than some of the newer episodes from just last year. It takes a lot of skill and restraint to make a film lampooning everyone (from the studio executives, disgruntled parents, and politicians) who seems to be against your art without seeming ham handed or preachy. And the songs. Holy crap every single song in this movie is a damn masterpiece. All of them are charming, funny, full of great lines, and insanely catchy. Every song just makes me smile, no matter what fucked up shit is happening on screen or what horrifying thing the song is about. Any movie that can make songs sung by gay lovers Saddam Hussein and Satan charming and funny, or make me even think about singing a song about fucking your uncle in public deserves all the praise it gets. This is the movie that sausage party was trying to be, but unlike that ass blast, this movie actually has some humanity behind it's crudeness. Plus it helps when your writers actually have some talent as well.
I have a definite soft spot for the TV show and thought it was time to watch the movie. It's very funny! I love the self-referential humor, and all around it was quite a hoot. Good stuff all around.
"Remember what the MPAA says; Horrific, Deplorable violence is okay, as long as people don't say any naughty words! That's what this war is all about!" A satirical conglomerate poking fun at as many social issues as humanely possible, and then some. South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut is the perfect transition into the big screen because it adheres to the storytelling powers that the very best of the series posseses. 'Therefore and But'. It's a simple concept of writing, removing "and then" in the script process so the story can progress with ease and clarity. But under Stone and Parker, each beat is an otherwise greater step, an avalanche of hysterical malevolence. From inappropriate movies to blaming Canada, Brian Boitano and relationship issues with the Devil, the beauty of South Park is one that shouldn't make sense, but does. This is why their 1999 foray into the big screen is one of the best comedies of its time, perfectly composed and hilariously inappropriate, covering a wide scope of issues in a perfectly paced 81 minutes. I haven't even mentioned the musical sequences which are divine and memorable in their own fu**ed up way. The Book of Mormon, one of the funniest experiences I've ever had in my life, finally makes sense now.
I kind of adored this.
This is technically my first complete viewing of this, though I caught 95% of it on Comedy Central a decade ago (I’d just missed the opening song, which I’d already seen parts of anyway in “Bowling for Columbine”). I’ve never been much of a South Park fan because much of their humor is too gross and nihilistic for my tastes. Still, parts of this movie do make me laugh. Also, I’m glad Kenny got to join those nude angels in Heaven at the end. It’s about time the poor kid got a break.
Trey Parker and Matt Stone are at it again with this movie. The intelligent humor from South Park, and the toilet humor both transition perfectly into this movie. Parker and Stone flexed their musical prowess as well, as this film is a full fledged musical. The movie is very funny and plays a great commentary censorship.
i'm legally obligated to watch this at least once a year
The epitome of South Park's creativity, cleverness and humor. No episode of the show has ever brought me as many laughes or as much investment as this film.
"Why do you always make love to me from behind? Is it because you pretend I'm someone else?" "Satan, your ass is big and red. Who am I gonna pretend you are? Liza Minelli?" It's hard to explain what a pop culture phenomenon SOUTH PARK became in the late '90's. While the show is still going strong today in its 22nd season and continues to have fans, I personally stopped watching around Season 4, which to me contained the show's most iconic and outrageous episodes. There really had never been another series like it at the time, with THE SIMPSONS and FAMILY GUY being the two most obvious comparisons. And of all three of those, SOUTH PARK was the one that made the most successful leap to the big screen, most likely because Trey Parker and Matt Stone made their film when the show was at the peak of its popularity. BIGGER, LONGER & UNCUT feels like more than just a long episode of the show; it feels like an event. It's a fun comedy, has "nothing is sacred" humor, great-looking animation, the apocalypse happening, and on top of that, it's also a really good musical. I think this was the biggest surprise of the movie: that's its songs, written by Tony-winner Marc Shaiman along with Parker, are great Broadway-quality songs, showing a lot of passion for musical variety and Disney conventions. I used to own the soundtrack and played it all the time (though sadly I lost it sometime during freshman year of college). All the songs are great, from the Oscar-nominated "Blame Canada" to "What Would Brian Boitano Do" to "Mountain Town" to "Uncle Fucka" to "La Resistance," to my personal favorite, Satan's sad and moving "Up There." Probably the nicest surprise is "Eyes of a Child" by Michael McDonald, which plays over the end credits. It sounds like the one serious song, until you actually listen to the lyrics and realize it's just as comedic as the rest. The film's plot is self-referential: our four heroes go to see an R-rated movie starring Terrence and Philip only to be overwhelmed by its gratuitous profanity (obviously the film-within-the-film is meant to be a self-parody). The children's parent's overreact and begin a censorship campaign, eventually invading Canada and setting about the apocalypse. Almost every character from the series is able to get a few good gags, along with some celebrity cameos, including Winona Ryder performing a very unique trick with ping pong balls and her vagina. The only element that slightly dates the movie are the jokes about Saddam Hussein. Considering how, only a few years after this film, Hussein would have his country invaded and be publicly executed by the US, portraying his death here in such a lighthearted manner feels flippant, but then again, that's what SOUTH PARK's humor has always been. This whole subplot, in which Satan and Saddam are gay lovers, and poor Satan is really lonely, is one of the funniest and more insane gags of the film. When it comes to what is the best SOUTH PARK episode, fans may have passionate debates, but BIGGER, LONGER & UNCUT represents the franchise at its A-game, with Parker and Stone bringing their best and most profane-yet-smart material to the table. The result is a satire that still holds up, as well as first taught me what menstruation was!
Yup, this movie is still perfect. I know it's not the most popular opinion but this might be one of my favorite comedies, musical, animated films or just films in general. I think everything works, I love the songs, the meta nature of the plot. And everytime I see Kenny take his hood off at the end I get goosebumps. 5/5
“Be Careful Dude.”  “Careful? Was my mother careful, when she stabbed me with a coat hanger while I was still in the womb?”  They better make a sequel, and it better involve Butters singing a showstopping solo number.
Not a wasted moment. One of the most endlessly rewatchable movies there is.  Very glad my wife actually liked it after being resistant for so long but a die-hard Broadway fan including The Book of Mormon.
Still a musical masterpiece! (I can grab a megaphone if you need me to.)
This musical is head and shoulders above what Frozen will ever be
YOU UNCLE FUCKER !!!!!!!!
How did this movie.... No, wait... WHY did this movie ever get made?  I think South Park is okay, especially as a TV show. It’s funny. This movie can be funny. But I read Roger Ebert’s review of this, and I pretty much agree with him: I don’t really feel GOOD about laughing at most of the obscene and over-the-line joke. (There are some that are genuinely funny. I don’t know why but the “Kyle’s Mom” song cracks me up.) But I don’t really think any of the jokes serve the story or the story’s perspective other than questioning just how far over the line you can go. I think that’s what the movie is trying to say, whether it’s about censorship or how media is consumed or whatever. But it seems like the movie is saying even self-censorship is bad, which I think is horribly mistaken.   I just didn’t really like it as a whole. There’s nothing about it that adds to my understanding of film or life or anything really. But, there are some funny jokes; it probably does produce consistent laughs throughout, and it’s an hour and a half that goes by pretty quickly, so that all adds up to about a 2 out of 5.
I HEARD YOU THE FIRST TIME! I’M NOT LOU FERIGNO FOR PETE’S SAKE! I am a big time Trey and Matt fan. There’s a lot I appreciate not only about the humor found in South Park, but in their approach to their multiple (AWARD WINNING) films and stage plays. It will be a sad day when they take their final bow.  I’ve seen every single episode of the show, but somehow I missed the movie which of course, did not disappoint. The things I found funniest? When Bill Gates gets his head blown off for Windows 98. Or how it was the filth that needed up saving the world. Awwww.
I remember being so disappointed when Kenny finally spoke. I don’t know what the fuck I was expecting 🤷‍♂️
South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut is an interesting film. Most of this review will be based on my personal experience since I find it hard to be super objective with films like this. While I've never been the kind of person to religiously watch South Park, I have seen a few episodes, and I can appreciate the tremendous impact it's had on satire, cinema, and popular culture as a whole. So I can definitely understand that I'm not the kind of person the film is aimed at, and that some of the references might go over my head, or the humour might not always strike a chord with me. The comedic aspect of the film was clearly assembled carefully, but I didn't find myself laughing consistently. Maybe it was intentional, but a lot of the jokes misfired (for me, at least). The meta jokes were pretty hilarious, though. The songs in the film are surprisingly good. A good lot of them have been stuck in my head at one point or another, which I would consider a win. After the opening sequence, I wasn't sure the musical aspect would work with South Park's style, but wow did they pull it off. That's easily the most impressive aspect of the film. The writing was incredible, I'll admit that much. If a gay relationship between Saddam Hussein and Satan has more chemistry than the couples in most romcoms, then you know the writing's good. Overall, the film is definitely above average, but I don't see myself returning to it anytime soon. I liked it, but I didn't love it. Even so, the writing, music, and story are surprisingly well put together. I know I'm not the intended audience, and I am being a bit harsh, so take my opinion with a grain of salt. 3.5/5
The best thing about this brilliant South Park movie is not that it is "longer," rather the fact that it is "bigger" and so ambitious: both as an incredibly hilarious comedy and as a musical full of awesome songs, while also upping the vulgarity seen on the TV show to a f***ing eleven.

I am one of the few people who has never seen an episode of South Park (shocking, I know), but I decided to give the movie a try anyway. And I'm so glad I did. While there were definitely running jokes from the series that i didn't get, I was still laughing consistently throughout the whole film. This an excellent example of a tv to film transition: when fans and non-fans can enjoy it. I can imagine people saying "It wasn't funny, it was just swearing." But it was swearing and saying bad language I the right context of the story and the jokes which made the film funny. Fair enough, not everyone has this sort of sense of humour, but for me it was just right. I want to just list off every funny thing in the film, but then I'd just be summarising it. The meta commentary of the content of the film was actually much better than what I expected. Going to war with Canada is a bit extreme, but I can imagine a lot of what happens as a result of the kids seeing 'Asses of Fire' happening in reality with Bigger, Longer and Uncut. The way that Stone and Parker pre-empted every argument that could be used against them by featuring them in the film was hilarious. And there is an obvious, but nonetheless necessary, criticism of the MPAA which is actually socially conscious. And the criticism of outraged parents is spot on, even more so nearly 20 years later when the internet makes angry mobs easier to convene. I shouldn't be too surprised by all these really... Team America was a great movie aswell.
i think i’ll stick to the show thanks
Reasons I love this film: 1. The satire is great. 2. The songs have still managed to be catchy almost twenty years after it's release. 3. The film is hilarious. 4. Not only is the satire great as I mentioned earlier, but the film is very thought-provoking and has a great message about the dangers of censorship. 5. The animation has a real cinematic quality. 6. The film led to the satirical South Park we know today, and I'm grateful for that.
The songs are still pretty funny, but even at 80 minutes it feels a bit too long
South Park is one of my favorite shows if not favorite. This movie basically did exactly what the title said made it bigger,longer and uncut. The humor, animation, themes and musical numbers are cranked up to eleven. This is the perfect movie that encapsulates so much of why I like the show.  5/5 Nah Terrence and Philip is the best show
This film makes you sympathize with fucking Satan. And for that. It gets 5 stars.
I haven't watched South park but this was ok mostly. I liked the bit where Cartman was Goku.
Still the greatest movie of all time.
(Old impressions, not based on a recent viewing) Hilarious as a kid, but I'm not sure it'd match my memory now.
Raunchy and insane.... but that's kind of the point. The social commentary is as strong as it's ever been and Trey Parker and Matt Stone really showed off their talents as Broadway Musical Writers. Definitely worth a watch if you're a fan of the show!
The older I get the less I like this.
BLAME CANADA, BLAME CANADA! THEY’RE NOT A REAL COUNTRY ANYWAY  Still one lf the best animated movies of the 90s. I feel like Parker and Stone are taken for granted, and their worth is not that appreciated. They are the masters of satirical comedy, and also pretty damn good songwriters! The whole soundtrack of this movie is fucking gold.
Imperfect, but consistently fun satire with superb musical numbers. 8/10
It’s crazy to think that South Park got a movie after being on the air for 2 years, although I do think they deserved it. In this they just went full out, it’s probably one of the most ridiculous movies I’ve ever seen, which I loved.  All the humor here is a little darker and absolutely absurd which I’m a fan of, and the fact that it’s a musically makes it quite more comedic. I still have that ridiculous Terrence and Phillips song stuck in my for better or worse.  The craziest thing to think about though is the point this 20 year old movie is trying to get across is just or even more relevant today then it was way back then. The MPAA is still acting like knuckle heads, and even more than ever radical liberals are trying to censor what one can and can’t say. One might even say this film is ahead of its time...
"Remember what the MPAA says; horrific, deplorable violence is okay, as long as people don't say any naughty words! That's what this war is all about!"  Oh man what a fucking joy of a film. It's a smart, raunchy takedown of how shitty the MPAA and rating systems in general can be, as well as groups that insist upon art being the reason for corrupting young people. It's essentially a long, uncensored episode of South Park and it's fucking awesome. I feel in parts it does try to stretch its runtime to be feature length but other than that this film is incredible. Highly recommended. Especially if you're a fan of musicals. There's more than a couple of bangers in here.
Pure perfection from the very first frame all the way to the post credits scene. Not only the best comedy ever made, but probably the best musical ever made. The South Park movie is unapologetic, filthy, hilarious, and intelligent. Not only will you laugh until your side's hurt, and maybe even piss yourself, but you just might learn an important lesson or two. Every song is perfect and I cannot watch without singing along with the biggest smile on my face, even during the credits. While the 90s had some truly great films, in general it was a weak decade for film, but if you watch this masterpiece, you would never be able to tell. I wish I could give this film 10 ☆ because it truly deserves that.
Project Recall - Ok I do remember going to see this one actually. My friend and his parents were over and I guess his dad was bored because he wouldn't stop talking about this movie and offered to take us. So we went. I can't remember if I was already watching the show or not at this point, I guess I was because I think I pretty much loved it. South Park has waned in recent years but this was around their hayday.
Saddam and the Devil stole the movie
"damn! shit! respect my fuckin' authoritah!!" – matt and trey at all other adult cartoons for real, its crazy to see how far south park has grown and evolved, yet still has that same edgy satire and surreal humour which made me fall in love with it in the first place. south park has a very special place in my heart.
"Mom, if you were in a German Scheisse video... you'd tell me right?" "Sure, sweetie" Stone and Parker really have storytelling to a T. Their jokes bounce off other plot threads, and every thread is as important as the last. It's such a fun film too considering the musical element to the film. Every song is a fucking banger epsicially "I'm Super" which is probably my favorite of them, or "Blame Canada" which was nominated for an Oscar... fuck yeah! Yeah. Fucking watch this movie, you fuck.
I’ve never really watched South Park, but this was just an utter blast. It’s chaotic and messy, but in a surprisingly satisfying way. And every time Stan pukes? I lose my goddamn mind. Hilarious on every level. The perfect raunchy animated musical comedy to end a millennium.
Idk how some people can actually not find South Park at least a little funny. It’s just so ridiculous.
9/10 This film is so funny. That's probably my highest praise for this film. It's a really funny musical. Even if you're not a fan of the show, I still recommend it because I laughed a lot throughout the movie. The voice work is great mainly done by Trey Parker and Matt Stone. I think it also delivers a message that is still relevant today. This movie is basically commentary on how people would most likely react to this movie when it came out in the 90s. It also tackles their issues with the MPAA, because that system is really stupid. When the kids see an R rated film and start swearing, all the parents start freaking out. However they don't get mad at the kids, they blame everyone else. Which is still constantly happening nowadays. They freak out that it's too vulgar for children to see and it is. It's rated R. It's not meant for children. However they still blame Canada. A comedic film about censorship is the perfect source material.  The film also involves America blaming a country for something that wasn't directly its fault and going to war with them. One could say that this film might've been ahead of its time. Overall, it's a very funny film with relevant commentary. The comedic timing is so perfect. Also the songs are quite good.
Greatest friggin musical of all time....'cept La La Land.
South Park: Bigger, Longer and Uncut still remains as relevant today as it did when it made its explosive debut in 1999, while also proudly reigning champion as one of the best musicals of all time.
No wonder I curse so much! BLAME CANADA!  "Your moms are just upset, they're probably all on their periods or something." "Mr. Garrison, Wendy and I think that was a sexist statement." "Well, I'm sorry Wendy but I just don't trust anything that bleeds for 5 days and doesn't die."
"And did you bring the butt for?" "What's a butt for?" "For pooping, silly."
what’s a butt for?
This last week we have been moving houses and we found a couple DVD players and this was the test movie but the thing is I just kept watching this movie all the way through.  In my opinion The best TV movie out there and hey, they finally beat the simpsons.
When you grow older, the film's problems become more evident. Regardless, I still love this movie.
"Haven't you heard of the Emancipation Proclamation?" "I don't listen to hip-hop." I haven't revisited this one in years and it still makes me laugh hard. While I am not the biggest fan of current South Park, the show holds a formative place in my heart. It managed to combine dick jokes with actual subversive political commentary and that's true here. This movie is fucking hilarious, maintaining the style and humor of the show while taking it further than the show could at the time. No stone is left unturned and no line is not crossed. Satan is not only a sympathetic gay character in this film...he has a Disney princess style ballad that manages to not only be fun but tear at your heart strings a little bit. There is something for everyone to be offended by in this movie while also having a relevant message about censorship. The idea of putting these characters into a Disney style musical is so inspired and fun. It also helps that the musical numbers are genuinely brilliant and catchy, especially the Oklahoma inspired Uncle Fucka, Blame Canada, and La Resistance. I had a great time revisiting this and I wish Trey and Matt would make another movie or something.
Despite some reliance on outdated pop culture gags, South Park: Bigger, Longer, and Uncut holds up surprisingly well due to its broadway-style musical songs, deceptively smart political & social commentary, and gut-bursting comedy. There's a reason the Broadway musical legend Steven Sondheim said that this was his favorite musical of all time.
Anyone who grew up in the 1990s can likely remember the thunderbolt of liberating inappropriateness that was, and still is, “South Park.” Gleefully tearing down good taste and censorship while incisively refuting much of the necessity for social graces, the show was a juggernaut before it was lost to its creators’s arrogance and vituperative personal grievances. Looking back, the movie shows all the best “South Park” had to offer, and the laugh-out-loud jokes are thrown like rhetorical grenades at the audience over and over. There are few comedies that are so consistently risky and hilarious, pushing the boundaries of acceptable cinema in nearly every scene while also keeping its humor rooted somewhere between the juvenile and the politically excoriating, resulting in one of the angriest, funniest, ballsiest studio comedies ever released. With a running time barely over eighty minutes, the movie moves at breakneck speed, never stopping to catch its breath or allowing the audience to do the same, but also not sacrificing density at the altar of brevity.
Terrance, why would you call me a pig-fucker?  Well let’s see. First of all, you fuck pigs.  Oh yeah.
What little I’ve seen of South Park has never made me laugh. Perhaps if I came across it when I was in middle school that kind of humor where the fact that there is a lot of foul language from kids would make me laugh. South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut was just taking the show concept to its ultimate conclusion without the restriction of censors, and even referencing itself. So it’s an inappropriate movie making fun of how inappropriate movies are treated as dangerous. It’s also a musical for some reason. I couldn’t figure out why it would break into song occasionally, but I guess the one compliment I can pay the movie is that the songs had catchy tunes which I could see becoming earworms. One thing that has always bugged me is that the art style is awful to a distracting degree. I know it’s all kind of intentional, but I don’t like looking at it and find it annoying that characters all look the same aside from their clothes. I know there are others who love this cartoon, and even think this film is brilliant, but I struggle to see why something like this is praised and The Happytime Murders crashed-and-burned critically and at the box office. In both cases it feels like the primary source of humor is just being crass, but because it comes from the innocent mouths of children in a cartoon (or puppets) we’re supposed to laugh. I think the self-referential nature of this movie might make it resonate more for people, and maybe they are bringing positive emotions from their enjoyment of the show to their opinion of this film as well. But this kind of comedy does nothing for me, so when I was watching South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut instead of enjoying myself I was mostly bored. It was kind of shocking to see the movie was only 80 minutes long, because I kept thinking it was dragging on too long, like a 30-minute episode of their show spread thin into a feature film.

Wow glad I finally got around to finishing this
Funny and annoying, the songs become exhaustive near the end.
Probably the only movie that makes Brian Boitano a hero, and deservedly so.
By far and none one of the best original movie musicals ever made.
Shut your fucking Face uncle fucker!!!
this has the best villain song of any film of the 90s; get your be prepared and hellfire outta here; this has clearly the best villain song. also this is unironically my favorite animated film now and i have no shame in saying that
The only movie worthy of a perfect 5/5. And that’s the truth. For those who don’t know, I am like the biggest South Park fan you’ll ever meet. I still remember the day I discovered it while channel surfing when I was little and all of a sudden I saw this weird looking cartoon talking about ginger kids. Good times.
Hilarious. Great musical.
Cartman: "All those times I said you were a big dumb Jew? I didn't mean it. You're not a Jew." Kyle: "Yes, I am! I am a Jew, Cartman!" Catman: "No, no Kyle. Don't be so hard on yourself."
Parker and Stone go against the grain by making a movie better than almost anything in the show, with satire that’s oddly on point coming from a couple of libertarian jagoffs.
Fond memories of begging my mum for the dvd, outside hmv.
Mocking Disney and musicals before Shrek ever did, "South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut" offers a fun and rumbustious good time for even those who have yet to seen the TV series.
Fuck. Asshole. Bitch. Motherfuckers and Shit. It's holyshit to watch this movie because it's FUCKIN HELL
I haven’t watched south park tv series previously. But this movie is such a hilarious comedy, ridiculous musical, sharp satire and absolutely brilliant.
It's a better musical than La La Land. Is that what the kids call a "hot take"? 😛
R등급 코미디의 쾌감이란 이런것! The pleasure of R-rated comedy is just like that!
Hilarious jokes, a great service to fans of the show, and incredible music that manages to be catchy, memorable, witty, and actually delievers a message! Fuck Phil Collins, this should have gotten the Oscar.
This movie is good. But I think fans of the show could agree that South Park gets funnier, more socially relevant and more ridiculous than this. They should've waited a few years to make a South Park movie, when the show really got awesome. So if you think this movie kicks ass, you have to go watch the show. It's sweet
60 minutes too long.  The first 20 minutes are great, the commentary on censorship is great, and the last 10 minutes are fine.  I couldn’t have cared less about the rest.  All the songs after Blame Canada really annoyed me.  I feel like I did when I watched the Matrix for the first time in like 2015. It doesn’t seem that great because it’s been done a lot, but if I had watched it when it came out I would have been impressed more. I understand that watching this in 1999 must have been wild, it was definitely pushing the envelope, but in 2018 it’s nothing we haven’t seen before.
it’s frickin’ hilarious dude so it’s just enjoyable at that, but like there’s also cool themes of censorship that are intelligent. so like it’s stupid funny and smart metaphor
“Over To The movies we shall go, where we learn everything that we know, cause the movies teach us what our parents don’t have time to say” The fact that they made a South Park film and decided to make it a musical is just, a brilliant choice
This movie has no right to be as good as it is. Someone adapt it as a Broadway stage musical RIGHT NOW please.
Yet again... I just think this movie's the bees knees in so many respects. Aside from packing in a substantial plethora of sight gags and jokes that span a sizable spectrum of maturity, Parker and Stone display expert comprehension of the musical form, exemplified by a stunningly smooth medley of six previously showcased songs sung by six groups of characters, perfectly placed to set the stage for the final act. The satire is far reaching and hilarious, jabbing at South Park's rudimentary animation, the MPAA and censorship, the sociological/cultural dangers ironically imposed by overprotective parenting, racism within the U.S. armed forces, the ridiculousness of the entertainment industry, etc. That Satan, depicted as a card-carrying homosexual, isn't the story's big bad -- the dishonor goes to revived spirit of Saddam Hussein -- is a subtle yet remarkable positioning, one which indicates hate and intolerance as forces far more sinister and detrimental than any peaceful identity (regardless of crudity, as in the case of Terrance and Phillip, who stand in as representatives of South Park's status in pop culture). With: Drew Bierle Where: Condo living room TV
I haven't seen much of the show but from what I've seen, I feel the same about this; I just don't get the appeal. Yes there is some clever and satirical writing but it's all bastardized by the crude animation, grating voice work and aggressively low brow sense of humour. The whole experience Is like watching an obscenely extended version of an early new grounds cartoon.
Debated between 3.5* and 4* but the raunchiness, coupled with a musical, can get me to 4* on originality, if nothing else. Much of the satire is still just as relevant and clever almost 20 yrs later.
This is a comedy masterpiece don't @ me
A classic pure and simple, South Park at its best.
I Like It I Joy It
I wasn't allowed to watch South Park in middle school so I memorized the script to this movie and played it over in my head
Remember what the MPAA says; Horrific, Deplorable violence is okay, as long as people don't say any naughty words!   I don’t know what this says about me and my taste but this is probably my favorite musical. It’s made the very prestigious list of musicals I actually like. This list includes, this, Monty Pythons’ Meaning of Life, and La La Land. I would add Jersey Boys but that’s more of a biopic. I’m sure my choices are unconventional but I don’t typically enjoy musicals. Anyway, I was already a huge fan of the show but I still hadn’t seen this until today. I really just enjoyed the hell out of this.
Funnier than I thought it would be considering I don’t really give a shit about South Park.
There's an indelibly cathartic quality to the film once the boys hear the obscene melody in the movie theatre and begin adapting its profanity into their everyday language. Team America: World Police as far as I am concerned is a bad film, and I am not a fan of the series this film follows whatsoever, and so my level of enjoyment came as quite a surprise. For the entirety of the first hour, this film is honestly strong in its songs and satire. Exposing the absurdity of censorship is the crux of the film, and its metatextual narrative is not shy of revealing its political intentions. It was working quite well for me; it got me thinking just as much as it humored me and put a smile on my face. It's just that in its last twenty or so minutes that its politics become more muddled, its jokes begin falling flat, and even the songs become less inspired. Case in point, I found the song that is sung by the Big Gay Al to be completely out of place, as do I the personified clitoris, the edgy resistance kid, and definitely the majority of the end fight sequence. These are jokes that had set-up but no logical leap to them as conclusions. It's a shame that it loses its way because I was really with it at first. I can't say I agree with its politics either. The MPAA is a flawed system, one that is extremely problematic in a variety of ways, but the core intentions behind it, as far as I know, come from a good place. I suppose I like more room for interpretation and analysis in my satire. There are many opportunities that this film missed, but still, the first big chunk of it is highly entertaining. It's far better than the garbage that is Team America at least.
Every single South Park episode is like marmite to me and this is clearly on the bad side of that. Not enough Butters.
I LOVE SOUTH PARK BEST MOVIE EVER 11/10. -/M
I must admit I've only seen a handful of South Park episodes. However what I've seen of the show I rather like and find hilarious. I was rather curious to watch the movie and I quite enjoyed it. The movie is hilarious from beginning to end. I also like how it parodies the Disney renaissance films being full of some really catchy and creative songs. Though probably my favorite parts of the movie where the scenes with Satan and Saddam Hussein in a homosexual relationship which had me dieing of laughter. In the end South Park: Bigger Longer and Uncut is really funny and I think you will enjoy it even if you aren't a big fan of the show. Just don't show it to your children or the easily offended.
A fun musical for the whole family! :)
Will somebody please think of the children? Being commonly referred as the year that changed movies, it's only fitting that 1999 hasn't lost its historical significance on the field of animation. The year saw the release of Disney's official last animated feature from the 'Renaissance' era, making a successful torch-passing to Pixar animation with the great "Toy Story 2". Although there is a natural propensity to label "Tarzan" the last classic animated film, in my humble opinion, this honor goes to the contender, the unexpected newcomer that blew me away, as a movie viewer, the movie adapted from a 2-year old TV series: "South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut". The most remarkable achievement of "South Park" is its perfect combination between a classic approach to the genre of animation with all the elements that forged the series' controversial reputation, and I'm not only referring to its use of vulgar humor and profanity but also its satirical treatment of timely issues, at a time where "The Simpsons" was starting to show a slight decline of quality. "South Park" feels like a two-part episode but with nothing to envy from Disney classic films, the plot is coherent, the film takes us in one of these unexpected climaxes like only the show has the secret, and I'll be damned if the film doesn't feature the greatest set of songs since "Aladdin". The songs deserve a whole chapter. The first time I saw "South Park", I didn't see them coming, it starts with what I thought was a cute homage to "Beauty and the Beast" with "Another Quiet Sunday Morning in my Quiet Mountain Town", a sympathetic way to introduce to all the characters (not everyone is familiar with the show after all). Then, the story takes off when the leading quarter Stan, Kyle (and his cute brother Ike) Kenny and Cartman go to the theater to watch the movie version of Terrence and Phillip, featuring the outrageous song with the titular F-verb involving a family member not to mention a very creative use of fart as musical accompaniments. Naturally, there is an uproar following the film's release, "South Park" prudish inhabitants, mostly mothers, lead by the dominant and hot-tempered Sheila Broflovski condemn the use of profanity, the vulg .wait, didn't I say that before? You got it, it's a self-referential plot where the creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone anticipate the reception of their own movies, something that can be summed up in a catchphrase belonging to the rival series: "will somebody please think of the children" The mothers form an association in order to protect children and since Terrence and Phillip are Canadian, they don't blame the government, nor society, nor the images of TV, they blame Canada! And right now, I have the "Canada" march in my ears and without a doubt the song of the year (played during the Academy Awards' Ceremony) "Blame Canada", the only one to be nominated for an Oscar, which is a shame, because there was at least 2 other titles to include. Indeed, "What would Brian Boitano Do?" would have been a great second choice, an example of great writing, catchy music and surrealistic fun. If "The Lion King" had three Oscar-nominated songs, I don't see why, "South Park" didn't get the same respect. What would a good juror do? Blame the Academy! The plot goes on and on and leads to one of these spectacularly cataclysmic twisted twists we never see coming when we watch "South Park", resolving a question many would have in mind. Indeed, I've often wondered why it took 17 years for the most successful TV sitcom of all-time "The Simpsons" to have its movie while "South Park" was still recent in mind, hell, even Butters wasn't a major player and Mr Garrison was still a man sadly, even Mary Kay Bergman, pretty much all the female voices in the film was still alive (Rest in Peace to one of the most talented female voices ever whose sudden suicide is the only veil of darkness on the film's shining legacy) Anyway, I guess the fans will know why the show made a movie so early "South Park" plots often start with an ordinary issue and takes inevitably dramatic proportions flirting with fantasy and surreal humor, it's satire to the extreme. This is why it's not surprising that the last act features a war between America and Canada, Stan's quest of Wendy's Heart and the mystery of the G-spot, and an unexpected cameo from the devil himself and his lover Saddam Hussein well, I understand the makers won't have a soft spot for the late dictator but I give them the benefit of the doubt, this was pre-11 September era (as if it ever meant something) and not all the members are Hitler-like figures. But the inclusion of hell is a good plot device as it allows one character to be still preeminent even after his death, you know who I'm thinking of, the one that got killed every episode because of some bastards' move. "South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut" is everything a film can be : an adventure movie, a satire, a coming-of-age story, a fantasy and more than anything, a great musical, this is Golden Globe, what I'm saying, Broadway material and I hope some producers will think of an adaptation, and I'm only half-joking. Witty, intelligent, subversive, the film is perfect to the point it even questions its own criticism through the very plot it features, not "The Simpsons : Movie", no classic Disney film ever achieved this. And for that achievement, I applaud the film, and me I don't applaud for not getting immediately the joke behind the title.
Saddam and Satan being gay lovers?! You already know this film is good. It's hilarious and definitely a must watch.
"South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut" is a masterpiece. Not only is this the funniest, most offensive film to date, but it's also the most important. The plot blends perfectly with the tv show's style, and so does the animation. The characters are all iconic and hilarious. The songs are unforgettable and works of art. But most importantly, this movie has a message to it: don't blame tv shows for your bad parenting. All parents should see this and learn to take personal responsibility for their actions. "South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut" is funny, has great characters, has perfect animation and writing, has amazing songs, and has an important message. This is my favorite movie of all time, and I highly recommend you watch it, and learn the appeal!
Still the best musical around.
One of the cleverest comedies ever made in my opinion, only deducting half a star because it’s a pretty ugly film (especially the scenes in hell).
To date, still my favorite portrayal of Satan in any media (though Care Bears 2 comes close). He's hilarious and gets what is by far the best song in the movie (sorry Brian Boitano). The message about hypocritical censorship is hilariously blunt, and the songs are surprisingly memorable, given how short and goofy they all are. Every significant character gets their moment, but none feel particularly dragged out (though the Clitoris subplot is a little forced and not particularly enjoyable). It's just a really, really funny movie.
This movie has seeped into my brain, forever permeating my subconsciouswith one-liners and some of my favorite musical numbers. There is never not a good time for South Park.
Just as vital and as funny as when I saw it on first release...
This is best movie based on an animated series. I can rewatch it so many times just for the songs alone. It’s just flat out amazing.
Has anyone else used “Barbra Streisand” as a curse word besides Eric Cartman?
Its not often that a movie makes me bust a gut laughing almost 20 years ago then makes me laugh the same way almost 20 years later. I got this movie free as a person who loves and owns as much movies as I do was giving away her movies I picked this one up. It is awkward how this can almost reflect American/Canadian relations right now in a way. I love South Park yet i never get to watch as much as I want but when I do I am always laugh, this movie is no different.
So effective because it’s so angry. While a typical episode may reach across the aisle to deliver a beat down of both sides of an issue, this a rare occasion that refreshingly defines the right and the wrong. It’s as if Parker and Stone wrote it with the prescient knowledge that the MPAA were going to be their number one enemies in the real world.  And what writing this is! I have my qualms with South Park’s indulgence in Cartman-isms, but thankfully his Jew-hating, mini-Hitler alter ego is almost non-existent. The movie makes great use of its cast and really pushes them in honest ways. Not a single subplot is unnecessary or wasted, either. This is a razor-sharp script, honed by writing seasons-worth of 21-minute episodes. Every hallmark of South Park you can find here pulls out the stops on the film, and really delivers a rousing, hilarious, insightfully crude time. If you only watch one thing South Park in your life, it has to be this. It’s a perfect distillation of the show’s icon, power, and impact.  And how about that music? The South Park team are some of the most gifted song writers in entertainment today. Change my mind.
obscenity in its most artful form.
I can see why people think it’s so good but none of it works for me.
This film is one of the greatest of the 20th century. It is absolutely hilarious while also developing a half decent plot. It features a beautiful score with songs like “Uncle Fucker” and “Kyle’s Mom is a Big Fat Bitch.” This is a beautiful yet hilarious film and one of the few I will consistently rewatch.
This is another review going into odd experiences of nostalgia, but I might as well review this somewhat, since it's not terrible. The South Park movie is far from a bad movie. Hell, I can easily see how some people love it. Why, because when I first watched it, I thoroughly enjoyed it. However, much time has passed, and I'm not too into the edgy humor of the long-running series any more. I can still respect some of what it does, and can still at times be very witty, but comes off as too crass at times. The film is some of its best, with some enjoyable humor, and for how much I enjoyed it when I was into edgy humor, I can clearly see how people can enjoy this film. I don't really have much else to say about this, so onward to the nostalgia portion of this review. At the time of watching this, I wasn't exactly in a great place in life. I was currently living in a hotel due to a house fire. I had broken my wrist, and my dominant one at that. During this period, I remember watching this, late at night in the living area of the hotel room. It's always interesting when you can tie stuff like this to very specific time periods and places in your life. I'm not quite sure why I'm writing about my life experiences during my watching of the South Park movie at 3 AM while I'm supposed to be finishing up homework, but I think I'm dying, so there's that.
I accidentally clicked play on Amazon Prime and couldn't find the will to stop it. I love this film.
Funny and inspired. Good jokes. Ridiculous. Very socially aware. Seems very inspired by Les Mis too, which is always a good thing.
Other People: "We've been skating all morning and laughing and talking of memories passed." Me: "I saw the South Park movie." Other people: "Awh-huwh..." Try not to pigeonhole this film by its superficialities. Most movies are terrible because they hide behind their supposed "subtleties". Clever and subtle can be all well and good, but I find the experience more enjoyable when the content is thrown in your face (with show tunes no less; which I rarely find enjoyable).   This is simply brilliant.
Part of my love for this is nostalgic—I remember watching this stoned with friends at university and screaming with laughter at Satan’s key change—but I’m also genuinely convinced this is one of the great satires of the late 20th century; a brilliantly profane assault on American hypocrisy which takes aim at censorship, religion, war and so much more, all bolstered by musical numbers that have no right to be as good as they are.
Not my cup of tea, but still an important film in the history of animated films. Has a lot to say about censorship in movies today.
The best musical ever made.
It's hard to imagine a time when South Park wasn't the never-ending goliath it is now but back in 1999 the show was still in its infancy. A mere 2 years or so into its run in fact, and yet the show had amassed such popularity in such a short span of time that it allowed its two creators, Trey Parker and Matt Stone, to develop their own full length feature film adapted from their hugely successful animated series. The end result was South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut which turned out to be exactly as advertised and more. The movie came out when I was 10 years old and unlike the boys in South Park I didn't have a hobo that I could bribe to help me sneak into an R rated movies and there was no way in hell my parents were going to take me to see this thing which is ironic since it sort of mirrors the actual plot of the film in many ways. Now, by the time the film finally came out on home video I had already sort of gotten over my little South Park phase and had by then moved on to other things and so I never got around to actually watching the film... until now. Was it worth the wait? Turns out I may have been better off watching the film back when it first came out because there are certain aspects of it which haven't aged particularly well now that we're nearly 20 years removed from it. It just seems like one of those "you had to be there" sort of film's. Mind you, the film is not without its charms, I just don't think it holds nearly as much power now as it did 19 years ago. Making the film a musical was certainly an inspired choice that allowed Stone and Parker in particular to really exorcise their love for the big Hollywood movie musicals of days gone by. Over the years, many of the film's songs have had their own little niche within the pop culture landscape such as "Blame Canada" and the now infamous "Uncle Fucka". These songs and others like "It's Easy, MMMKay" and "Hell Isn’t Good" are gems that are as infectious now as they were back when they first exploded into popular consciousness. Others like "I'm Super" as sung by the character of Big Gay Al or "I Can Change" by Saddam Hussein either never really got off the ground or failed completely to stick their landing. What with the somewhat up and down quality of the film's musical output, it's fitting then that the jokes featured in the film share the same somewhat frustrating inconsistency. The ones that do find their target end up killing while those that don't end up landing with a pretty resounding thud. In certain cases where it's obvious that Parker and Stone have failed to come up with a clever punchline they'll usually try to cover it up by making Cartman or whoever cuss up a storm and that right there is the joke but it's just not all that funny. There's only so much comedy mileage you can get out of making kids swear. There's a specific line there and in trademark South Park irreverent fashion Parker and Stone just sprint right over it and keep on going. It wouldn't be South Park without some biting social commentary and Bigger, Longer & Uncut certainly does not disappoint in that regard. In fact, there are very few targets that are exempt from the duo's mighty wrath but perhaps the one target which gets skewered most of all is the MPAA for its utterly antiquated policies on movie ratings. The film goes to great lengths to try and expose the evils of censorship as well as promote the importance of free speech. It also goes to great lengths to shine a spotlight on the perils of what I like to call "hysterical parenthood". Meaning overzealous parents who go out of their way to point the finger towards anything and everything in an attempt to divert the attention away from their own shortcomings as parents. In the case of Bigger, Longer & Uncut, the parents' adopted target was my own home country of Canada who they lay blame for allegedly having corrupted their children's imaginations through the exposure of their imported comedy duo, Terrance and Phillip. The mob mentality of the parents escalates to a point where the United States of America is on the verge of all-out war with its closest ally and Cartman, Kyle, Stan and Kenny are the only ones capable of putting an end to all the madness through simple use of common sense which is something that seemed to be sorely lacking in society back in those days. Funny how things never change, huh?
SHUT YOUR FUCKING FACE, UNCLE FUCKA!!
watched last night for the first time in forever  by my lonesome and i was crine the whole time. I would hate to make a cartoon post south park because it’s impossible for it to ever be funny, i.e bobs burgers, “rick and morty” & big mouth. Trey Parker perfected it on all aspects. I used to think seth mcfarlane was talented with his musical stuff because he thinks he’s bob hope and sinatra but the songs in this are way funnier than anything he could ever make. and the way Trey Parker parodies america is better than anyone besides the creators of GTA.
A great musical surprising enough 67/100
I really don't know what to think about this one. It could be brilliant or it could be really strange. And I'm going to have to say that this one for me wasn't that good and it really was a waste of time.
this movie shouldn’t be allowed to be this good
Best musical of all time
Hi, we replaced your heart with a baked potato. You have about 5 seconds to live.
“Because the movies teach us what our parents don’t have time to say.” What a like, what a film.
I reviewed this last year- watched on tv again- it is brilliant
Expect nothing more than the humour you get from a normal south park episode, but with the addition of many great songs. Somehow a musical fit the tone of the movie perfectly, but the humour just isn't cutting edge. Philosophically this film is amazing, but not a comedy masterpiece.
Quite possibly the greatest animated musical of all time. You’ll have “Uncle Fucka” stuck in your head for weeks.
Think it is safe to say, this is my favourite musical film.
I honestly do not have too much to say about this movie other than: 1. I never thought I would ever see this movie 2. I also never thought I would ever see THAT much of Saddam Hussein Other than that it is pretty funny; an outrageously offensive time with some great satire about censorship!
The biggest 'Blowing the Fuck Out' moment to the MPAA we will ever get. Helps that it's also a decent musical and a decent comedy in it's own right.
Tarzan bearing this at the Oscars is the worst thing to ever happen to cinema.
I love the show, and I love the movie.  it’s comedy gold, has memorable scenes, all the main characters shined. not to mention the amazing soundtrack! (the only reason why I don’t give it 5/5 is because I watched this with a friend once and now they quote the classroom scene, and sing “kyle’s mom is a bitch” all the time and it’s started to annoy me oof)
Forgot how musical this film is. Parker and Stone manage to make it not feel like 5 episodes sown together and a proper feature that's still hella funny even today.
Everything you could want from a South Park movie and more.
why have I heard most of these songs without seeing true film I’m so confused
I don’t know who Brian boitano is but I love him
South Park: Bigger, Longer, and Uncut is hilariously funny, rude, and wildly good. Trey Parker and Matt Stone do a perfect job in this film, even if the movie can be really rude and offensive, it's still a very funny and hilarious comedy. My daughter is visiting Colorado soon so we had a gd laugh watching this tonight 😁😂🤣 youtu.be/48XreePDi8k
Better than the drawn together movie for sure
My first experience of South Park was exchanging songs from this film with other boys from school over Bluetooth using our terrible phones circa 2006.
Yes, yes I've seen the South Park movie who wants to touch me? I SAID WHO WANTS TO FUCKING TOUCH ME!
If I was into South Park when this movie came out, this would've been a really big deal. It gives a lot of payoffs that are worth it I guess. It's exactly what you'd expect and it's not bad. I just don't know if I'd ever watch it again.
Extremely crude, extremely offensive, and extremely hilarious
This honestly surprised me. I expected a really silly, immature comedy film that'd make me laugh and instead I got just that, but with commentary on censorship, discrimination and war.... and also it's a musical. I honestly didn't expect the musical aspect of this film to be actually well done, but it's a really great musical, with some catchy fun songs sprinkled throughout the film. The commentary is pretty fantasticly done. It's not only well done, relavent commentary on society, media, discrimination and shifting the blame to a generalised group of people , but it also leads to great humour too, without sacrificing the comedy. Speaking of which, this movie is pretty funny. I've never really watched South Park, but the comedy just works in this. It's crass and horrible and slightly offensive, but it's all pulled off and is somewhat self-aware of itself. The pacing was also great in this. This movie lasts just over an hour, but it honestly feels like more because of how fast paced everything is, which isn't a negative.  This movie is just so great. I love it.
Brilliant. Iconic as hell. Stands the test of time. I'll never forget being in the boys' shoes trying to see THIS movie. Life mirrors art and art mirrors life. Highly quotable. Highly SINGABLE! Now, SHUT YOUR FUCKING FACE UNCLE FUCKER AND GO BLAME CANADA! "I'm sorry, I can't help myself. That movie has warped my fragile little mind."
I have never seen an episode of the South Park TV show but I had high hopes for this, given how much I enjoy Parker & Stone's other musical efforts. The music is definitely the best part of this film. Some of these songs are fantastic -- clever lyrics, music that is a perfect parody of various musical styles, and, on the whole, pretty solid jokes. But compared to something like Cannibal!, the jokes are much more sophomoric, and compared to The Book of Mormon, the satire feels extremely aimless. There's a carelessness to this (that I suspect is tonally carried over from the show itself) that not only keeps it from ever really working but frequently gets in the way of the actual jokes. I chuckled a few times, but on the whole I wasn't sold. How it entered my Flickchart: South Park > No Country for Old Men (which really needs to be moved out of the center of my chart) South Park < Baby Driver South Park < The Village South Park < Ghost World South Park > Lolita (1997) South Park < All That Jazz South Park > National Lampoon's Vacation South Park > The Magnificent Ambersons South Park < Wreck-It Ralph South Park > Silent Hill South Park < Crocodile Dundee Final spot: #1265 out of 2775
Always has been and always will be my favourite comedy movie
It's just great to see how much Parker and Stone can get away with that no one else would be able to. Just like in the show the message of this film is never subtle, but it would be unfitting if it was. The MPAA doesn't get railed nearly enough. Beyond the over-the-top humor, this film reaches a level of social commentary that the show didn't in my opinion until the last few seasons. It seems like the duo has really perfected that side of their work, and the impact of the movie is lessened a bit by being overshadowed by some of the newer episodes. Still, when Sadam Hussein breakdances to win back Satan's heart or Cartman summons force lightning by shouting "respect my fucking authoriteh!" what can you really say against it?
Almost 20 years old, yet had the ‘around the world’ segment of ‘Kyle’s Mom’s a Bitch’ been any longer, I’d have ruptured something from laughing so hard.
This movie...this movie is the definition of hilarious. I can understand why some people don't like this movie, it's messed up and gross. In my opinion this is one of the best animated movies. It has a good soundtrack and feels like an extended South Park episode.
I never got around to watching South Park on tv, I still don’t know why, but I’m aware of how brilliant it’s satire is, but I have seen this movie and I love it. It’s a great meta movie with hilarious satire of censorship, the music is surprisingly great, the characters are entertaining, stupid but charming. Really love watching this
This film disappointed me a lot. I expected so much from it as I love both the show and the games of South Park and a movie sounds amazing. But the plot and all the songs just ended up boring me to the point where I just wanted it to finish and couldn’t stand another minute of it.
Love this film
4th time. Saw it first time on the Paramount lot in July 1999. What can you say about 4 kids from a small Colorado town who end up facing the Devil and a dead Saddam Hussein, all because of a little film from Canada? It's freakin' awesome!
just as hilarious as every episode of the show. the musical numbers are phenomenal and really make the film unique. plenty of funny moments but their weren’t any jokes that had me rolling on the floor. let’s get a sequel already!
Ahh, the gold ole days back when Parker and Stone just wrote well thought out juvenile comedy. The funniest South Park has been in the last 20 years.
Definitely one of the best movies based on a TV show. The songs are genuinely great, and the last few seconds of this movie are one of my biggest crying moments in all of film.
One of my favourite animated movies ever. It's absolutely hilarious, has a good story, funny visuals, and catchy songs.
this film is the peak of comedic satire. it’s honestly genius how they make a social statement about the show and it’s impact. it’s by far my favorite musical of all time
This was step 4 in my watch through of all of South Park. I can’t get blame Canada out of my head now.
After 19 years, SOUTH PARK: BIGGER, LONGER AND UNCUT still holds up so wonderfully. What’s most surprising is that it’s a full blown musical, filled with songs that hark back to the Disney Renaissance era but with a decidedly subversive bent. The satire is so sharp but at its core, there is genuine heart. In this film, you can easily see the genesis of their Broadway smash Book Of Mormon.
Pretty damn cool. I'm a huge South Park fan, so this doesn't disappoint. Has everything you would expect from Matt and Trey. This is just great. The only thing that might have this beaten is the game series.
South Park is for me, a show that is hit or miss. Some episodes truly are hysterical and great satire. But some are just dick and fart jokes or too fucking preachy. This movie encompasses all that is good about South Park. Mild dick and fart humor, with great satire and funny jokes and songs. It doesn't get up its own ass with unnecessary messages and just fart for 80 minutes...no it is pretty damned solid.
High quality cinema!!!!!
oh my, i think that's one of best metaphors about freedom, isn't it?
Been a while since watching this. It has some really good parts to it but really just feels like a longer version of an episode. Seems like they relied on some of their signature jokes from the show. Doesn’t feel like you’re watching a special movie or anything. I don’t mind musicals but the one thing I didn’t really like as much was all the songs. It’s still good and what you’d expect from South Park.
Shit faced cockmaster, donkey raping shit eater. Masterfully woven dialogue from a true classic of animation. In all seriousness though, this still makes me laugh and it's still massively entertaining. South Park is the best animated show of all time!! Still like the simpsons and the movie but cmon the simpsons fell of a long long time ago. I don't see any other contenders
one time i farted on the set of blue lagoon
The greatest movie musical ever made
Watching this in a hotel is a decent time so yay
It takes .0001 seconds for me to be back on my south park bullshit and that's done by literally seeing that the sun is shining and the grass is green (under the 3 feet of snow I mean) a day like this it's hard to wear a frooooown, all of the happy people stop to say "Hello!" ("Get out of my way!") even though the temperature's low, it's a perfect Sunday morning in my quiet little mountain toooooown..........
1999 Movielog #58 I'm sure I'd appreciate this movie more now. I'm still watching the show as of 2018 although I rarely watched the first ten seasons when they aired. The film was certainly ambitious and took no prisoners, and was an essential part of Parker and Stone's rise to fame.
I genuinely believe that this is one of the greatest musicals ever made. It's brilliantly funny while proudly conveying a legitimately meaningful message. Deliberate and purposeful silliness when done right is easily one of my favourite concepts within any art and this film is a beautiful example of that.
Funny, with a solid plot and undeniably catchy songs, this movie is one of my favourite, if not the favourite, movie musicals to date. Absolutely the peak of everything South Park-related they have done. I am sincerely glad that this movie was made, and there will always be a special place in my heart for it.
Each time I watch this movie. I laught all the time. The story is really excellent and the gags are unbelivable and cult. Trey Parker and Matt Stone make a miracle to adapt an adult tv show to movie without less the essential and maybe better than the original product. A must for all the people likes stupid story and anim. He too, the music is excellent and he sould was the oscar for the song BLAMA Canada but it’s wasn’t the idea.
[Commentary by Trey Parker, Matt Stone, various staff members & Bill Hader (!)] Matt & Trey are known for mini-commentaries on episodes of South Park, so in order to fill the time for a feature length track, they go out into their production office (where they’re starting Season 13) and grab people that worked on the movie. Then they run out of people that were around during that time, as this is the 10th Anniversary BluRay, so they grab a couple others, including Bill Hader.  He makes any commentary worth listening to. I also had no idea he worked on the show until I heard this commentary for the first time, and now he’s doing more voice work on top of story, since he left SNL.  The best part though is that Matt & Trey shit on the Paramount execs they had to deal with for almost the entire running time. If South Park wasn’t still being released by them (they’re currently doing BluRays of every season), I don’t think this track would’ve been heard.
This is the most nostalgic movie of all time for me.
So politically inappropriate thats its funny but did I laugh out loud ...........no
