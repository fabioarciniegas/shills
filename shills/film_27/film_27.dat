Admittedly only watched this to make sense of all the references made in Community, but I was NOT expecting that level of violence, especially from TV’s favourite dads!
Tired: Wanting a Come And See Criterion Release Wired: Wanting criterion to re-release the Robocop Criterion on blu-Ray
Robocop is an action packed, violent fun film with just enough emotional scenes in between and great characters and scenes to make it a classic. Percentage: 90%
The lack of inflection in the line "Bitches, leave" is so funny to me in such a particular way. Also, spot all the Twin Peaks actors !! I mean, what can really be said about Robocop? It's basically perfect.
Robocop was my favorite film of all time as a kid up until the 1993 release of Jurassic Park. As a kid, it was mesmerizing... I mean come on, it brought me #robots... The visual effects were as stunning as The Terminator or Aliens, and the story was dark and enthralling. My appreciation has only grown through the years. As an adult, I've appreciated Verhoeven's willingness to leverage his style to make a commentary on 1980s corporate America, and the demise of the Detroit-centered automobile manufacturing industry. The commentary is executed in the most genius and artful ways possible. The film doesn't need to preach its message. This is emphasized by obscure details like how ED209 represents a bulky and clumsy and expensive pile of junk, just as overfunded and overconfident as some American automobiles of the era. Robocop just really sticks its landing, but more impressive is how far it endeavoured to leap.
back in the 80s you had Superman, Batman, Terminator, and well Robocp.  Out of all of those movies this one stuck out the most to me till this day. There will never be a movie full of gore, cheese, one liners, and absolute futuristic technology that even today can’t replicate but comes close.  This is not a movie for the light hearted.. its mot a love story.  This movie is about hope.. revenge.. and what a true cop should be.   The scene with Alex Murphy getting shot to death is one of the most painful things I have ever seen.  The unrated version goes a few steps beyond.  Murphy is then dragged away by his partner to the hospital where they have the technology to try and keep him alive as a robot.   Grab some berers, grab some friends, grab something to relax you.. sit back and enjoy what could become today.. could become Now.   Dont watch the remake.. it lacks blood and gore which made this movie what it is today. Also if you dont like this movie.. please unfollow me.. dont need your kind around here
RoboCop is probably my favorite movie. It's a movie I never seem to get tired of. Paul Verhoeven and company saw the direction the world was heading and created a nightmarish dystopian vision of the future that we're basically living in today. With social services gutted and privatized, the media completely useless and inept, everything is sacrificed on the altar of "corporate growth". The future we all wanted was Back to the Future 2, but the future we got was RoboCop.
I'm taking tonight to rewatch all the movies I need to for my Film Analysis final paper. I'm so excited to write about this film. I first saw this film at the beginning of high school and liked it, but as I got older and kept rewatching it, I started to pick up on all its deep themes of how fucked industrialization and capitalism can be. Like how did a film called "Robocop" become damn intellectual?! It's just so perfect, never before has a science fiction film been so unique. Not to mention that everything else aesthetically kicks absolute ass. The soundtrack is incredible, the makeup and costuming is so impressive, and for the most part, the visual effects aren't all that dated! Peter Weller just such a fantastic job with his performance as Robocop, especially with all the physically aspects. Every time I rewatch this film, I always find myself walking like Robocop, how does he make such an awkward walk look so badass?! This film is a definite favorite of all time.
Because "scumbags see the judge on Monday morning."
This movie was soooo much better than I expected it to be. A shitty 80s action movie had no right to be that creative and interesting.
I lost it in the scene where “E 209” fell, because it wasn’t able to walk down the stairs..
I was not high when I watched this movie.
I'm watching RoboCop (1987)...the original and the best. I'd buy that for $1 :D
“That’s it buster, no more foreign aid for you!”
Always amazed at how perfect this is. Seamlessly blending action and satire from the second it begins to the frames right before the credits roll. The very beginning standing as a thesis statement for the rest of the film, the title card appearing seemingly out of nowhere and rolling out with the faux-smiling news anchors accompanied with the always hilarious Verhoeven staple commercials ("Pakistan is threatening my border!" "That's it, buster. No more military aid!") creating the perfect atmosphere for the perfect film. Don't believe me? Just take a look at Kurtwood Smith's straight-faced delivery of, "Can you fly, Bobby?" you'll see why this movie holds up so well.
A fantastic dark comedy about political turmoil in the not too distant future of the Detroit area. Robo Cop, the next generation of police force is put to the test to stop all crime, no matter the purpertrator. But what can a single Robot Cop do against the organized crime syndicates that plague the city? Can Robert Crop truly bring justice to the city which hates authority and oozes with corruption?
This might be one of the best '80s film of all time. Its a great action film, but its also a great satire. This film is as much a hybrid as the main character. I always shocks me a story with this ridiculous of a concept can be this good. It is inspiring.
'Robocop' is an excellent satire on American culture, great action movie, gritty and super violent, it's funny, lots of people get thrown through glass, it's super enjoyable, what's not to love? Everything it sets out to do, it does it exceedingly well. It never takes itself very seriously, but it takes itself seriously enough to never undermine its own intentions. It also does a ridiculously good job of predicting the future - DVD's, GPS, Detroit is a dilapidated shithole, there's an awful sitcom that everybody thinks is great (like 'The Big Bang Theory'), etc. It hits all the right marks.
There's a strong justification in the creation of the RoboCop in the malfunction of the ED-209 (which, by the way, the stop motion for is the coolest thing about this movie), because it would otherwise make no sense whatsoever. It still never strikes as a good idea, but I buy that these simpleminded, money grubbing company higher-ups would fall for anything in their 80's camp. I love that this future Detroit is just the 80's but it also has RoboCop and the ED-209, and I don't know if this was the idea or if the filmmaker's just didn't feel the need to craft a predictive environment, but it's as if the only attention on technological progression is reserved for weaponry, and the government is so focused on protection that it even grants the corporation power over the police force. That's as much as I can say for the world of this film which means that it's not a great sci-fi movie, the action is dull because hyper-violence doesn't equate brutality which means that it's not a great action movie, so that leaves its strongest facet as the character study. The greatest moment in this is when RoboCop strips his helmet, revealing nothing but the face of Murphy stitched onto a metal frame-- a pretty haunting image that leaves the man as a helpless prisoner trapped inside the machine. He never asked for this and there's nothing he can do to reverse it. The alternative, of course, was death, but you can see in his eyes that even he is unsure if that's preferred.
Great action movie. Sadly i saw the 2014 Robocop before this one, however I completely forgot about that one. It did taint my view of Robocop before now though. 4/6
What I Learned: There should be a sub-genre called 'future propaganda' Direction: ★★★★★ Acting: ★★★★★ Script: ★★★★★ Cinematography: ★★★★★ Sound: ★★★★★ Re-Watchability: ★★★★★ Hails of Bullets: ★★★★★ I Suggest: District 9
Reason to watch: Peak 80’s action. But also one of the strongest social satires and exploration of humanity and identity. Reason to not: The satire is most evident in the director’s cut, so you gotta go with that one, and it might be a little too graphic for the most squeamish.
Dun der der der derrrr, dun der der derrrr, dun der der der derr derrrrrr. Every time I hear that music with the relentless cow bell it fill me with joy as we must be watching the ultimately quotable, super satirical and hugely exciting cult classic Robocop. This violent Sci-Fi action romp still holds its own today and stands tall as one of my favourite 80's films. It was also the first 18 certificate film I owned on VHS. It has a fantastic and iconic soundtrack and some rather funny news reports and adverts that add a great edge to an already superb film. Although marred with difficulties in production this film is perfect. A brilliant vision. Even with Dick Joneses ridiculously long arms in the final scene it has firmly become one of my favourite films. Violent, visceral and ultimately entertaining. Isn't it time you gave it another go? I'd buy that for a dollar.
They really don't make movies like this anymore
Absolutely fuckin’ baddass.
So much more than an action movie.
Classic Science thriller which has lost none of its satirical edge or the power to shock and thrill. The music's so iconic too.
"Pretty neat."-RoboCop "Stay in touch."-RoboCop "Buddy, I think you're slime"-RoboCop "Your move, creep."-RoboCop "Stay out of trouble"-RoboCop "Come quietly, or there will be...trouble."-RoboCop "They'll fix you, they fix everything."-RoboCop
Maybe the most quotable movie I have ever seen.
A near prescient depiction of corporate fascism.
RLM commentary is pretty epic
RoboCop is the type of film that on first viewing can be marked down as a typical film of the 80s - a simple plot, a bit of action, an unlikely hero and a bleak take on what the future may bring. However, RoboCop is so much more than that. Paul Verhoeven has created his dystopian vision of Detroit and interwoven an entertaining and satirical look on society as a whole. I would put Verhoeven on a pedestal for these types of films which he has repeated through: Total Recall, Starship Troopers and Basic instinct. Ok, I was joking about the last one. Robocop gives us a human look at suffering together with the morality and ethics of what we can and should do with life. But it also makes us laugh in places while being appalled by the over the top tongue in cheek violence. I also love that certain scenes weren’t toned down by a faceless studio exec. This film deserves its 18 rating and is all the better for it. I’d definitely buy that for a dollar. The leads and support play their parts perfectly - Weller and Allen are the straight guys while most of the bad dudes are over the top caricatures of what a bad dude should be. Clarence Boddicker is one of the most despicable characters in film, but you have to love him. And poor Emil - even though he’s a horrible person, I still feel sorry for him... It’s just a shame that the sequels and remake are poor imitations of the original. I love this film but don’t think any review by me could do it justice, so I’ll hand over Robert Lockard @dejareviewer to give us more reasons why everyone should love his film: dejareviewer.com/2014/04/29/cinematic-chiasmus-robocop-is-almost-perfectly-symmetrical-film/
You'd be hard-pressed to find a better action movie, sci-fi movie, or satirical movie from the 1980's than "Robocop". Is it dated? Yes. Is that a bad thing? Only if you think all movies should look and sound like they were made at the same time by the same kinds of people. Revisiting it for the first time in several years, I was struck by how many things that were meant to be satirical in 1987 -- the cops wearing full body armor and carrying assault weapons, the privatization of a city's police force, those pathetic excuses for newscasts, etc. -- feel like they border on documentary realism in 2018. Sure, I could complain about how the script relies a little too much on the Talkative Badguy confessing his nefarious plans in key moments. But why would I want to waste my time on that kind of reductive thinking when there's so much to admire here? Paul Verhoeven's masterpiece!
A whole hell of a lot of fun. Pretty smart for an action flick, with some great dystopian future satire and dark humor.
“Dead or Alive, you’re coming with me!”
It’s perfect for what it set out to do.
Robocop is a f***ing national treasure.
Every time I watch this movie, I like it even more. The story is depressing because it may as well be set in 2018, but it's funny because it's basically like watching 1987 do an impression of 2018. This is evidence that action movies are perfectly capable of telling an interesting, meaningful story. I guess 'Die Hard' and 'Conan the Barbarian' are in that same category.
Hot damn, I don't know how I sat on this one for so long but I'm glad I finally watched it. Not only does it have it's own sense of meta humor but the dialogue is hilarious and fun. "You're gonna be a bad motherfucker!" "Bitches leave." and of course, "Dead or Alive, you're coming with me." So so good. Annoying villains that get absolutely wrecked in satisfying fashion. It does have an ending that's so abrupt that it doesn't conclude the police strike subplot, but the last scene is just almost too badass to care. To my knowledge, the sequels aren't anything special, but I hope to watch them soon.
All films should end as abruptly as this. There you go, amazing film, bye.
As much as I abhor the politics I am a huge fan of crime exploitation flicks, but at a certain point this one turns it on its head and goes after the people in power in the end.
Netflix watch
“He had a dream.” we’re all a product of the machine, now it’s up to us to retain some piece of our identity amidst the corruption and do good.
Boy howdy is this movie violent!
Nothing says an 80’s film without over-the-top acting & practical effects.
Fella gets shot right in his dingus, what’s not to love?
“ Well listen  chief your company built the fucking thing and now I’ve got to deal with it. I haven’t got time for this bullshit. “
One of the best sci-fi films of all time.
What can I say that hasn't been already said about this film except that it's damn near if not perfect film. A genre classic that has the perfect blend of Cyber Punk Sci/Fi , Action and brilliant Satire with an amazing cast and Paul Verhoeven and Rob Bottin behind the camera it all makes for a true classic.
Film #48: Film School Drop Outs (2018 Weekly Challenge) Theme: Cyberpunk & Tech Noir Well, this is prescient. I’d probably have nightmares about how terrifyingly familiar this all seems now if it weren’t for the high entertainment value that Verhoeven adds here. RoboCop has that satirical bent to it that makes it rather hard to bang out a solemn analysis of how humanity is doomed due to mass corporatization and the advent of surveillance states. You want to do it, and then you remember the scene where a man drives into a vat of toxic sludge and emerges with his skin melted off. It subverts your desire to bemoan the state of the world because, in the moment, you simply want to cheer on Murphy for retrieving his lost identity so that he can take down the men who so cruelly robbed him of his former life. In fact, there’s an interesting push and pull between disliking the concept of a RoboCop and sympathizing with one, which extends to our present-day ambivalence about policing and its problematic culture. But again, the film tells you not to overtax yourself with contradictory feelings. Your prime directive is to enjoy this adventure for what it’s worth, and then deal with your anxieties at a later time. So who knows, maybe the existential dread will creep up on me by Christmas Eve! As someone who was only peripherally aware of a RoboCop franchise before this, and who is not especially crazy about cyberpunk, this all went down better than expected. Verhoeven’s cheeky use of news bulletins as interstitials was one of his many quirks that raised the film in my estimation, and the graphic violence—while not excessive—helped double down on the story’s tragic elements. It’s quite an interesting coincidence that I watched Bonnie and Clyde before this, because the way they handle their tones is quite similar. Both utilize graphic violence for shock value, but also take a more comic route for scenes of high intensity (like, for instance, when Murphy throws Boddicker through three sheets of glass for no particular reason). The films are about twenty years apart, and yet you can see some of Bonnie and Clyde’s influence (and, in turn, New Hollywood’s influence) on this sci-fi spectacle even now. I also hear there’s a sequel in the works, and I’m already terrified it’s going to be the most self-serious thing imaginable. Verhoeven was really the perfect choice for this film, and anyone who can’t match his level of subversion is going to fall flat on their face. I can tell you that right now.
Cheesy, over the top and great fun, RoboCop is a great 80’s action flick. With a good story and surprisingly good twists, RoboCop is a masterpiece compared to its PG-13 remake. Slightly confused on why criminals would keep shooting at him though.
Masterfully made action film that’s the antithesis of the 70/80’s vigilante films. It skewers everything from capitalism, corporate interest in public trust, mass media, body image and gun control. It’s a very sharp screenplay and visually astonishing. The sad part is that’s is more relevant now then when it was made. An absolute genre masterpiece.
Being as the first movie I ever remember seeing is the Blues Brothers, the '80s gritty city on display and lived-in feel of the sets put me right at home. There's a lot of little things like that I like in this movie. The Godzilla like animation of the ED-200, Bob being the kid with the coolest toy at school, Red Foreman looking cocky and dangerous, the wood-paneled precinct, the ensemble acting. I'm not sure how much I like the whole, but all these touches make it a lot of fun to watch.
Kinda great, kinda shit. I knew there'd be a bit of 80's style action induced gore but wasn't expecting some of that to have a kind of body horror vibe about it. Those special effects are mainly rad and as daft as it looks i like the stop motion mega bot type thing. Neat. Robocop himself when he takes off that helmet looks so good, right? Also, I'm convinced Lynch cast Ray Wise after seeing him facially emote in this movie. Couple of Leland esque screamy laugh things in there too. When I clocked that this was directed by the dude that directed Total Recall, everything kinda made sense. And when I seen Red Foreman pop up I knew someone was gonna end up with a foot in their ass.
Red Forman SNAPPED here
incredible blend of action and comedy
Good special effects for people being shot and shit
That’s it buster! No more military aid!
Possibly the best 2 quid I spent on a movie, excellent concept, violence and a very original sci fi film
One of the greatest action movies of all time. Robocop has everything. Great plot, great characters, great effects, ultra-violence and a healthy dose of comedy and satire. There are so many memorable moments. The crazy opening, the introduction of ED209 and toxic waste man being personal favourites. The news segments are also great; something I couldn't fully appreciate when I was younger. Robocop is amazing. Watch it.
Can’t beat some 80’s cheese
In 1987, Paul Verhoeven gave us a sci-fi/superhero action film set in a dystopian future (2043 to be exact) but added in a sociopolitical messages and satire that showed it was a film of not only brawn but brains. Robocop himself was inspired by Space Sheriff Gavan, the six million dollar man, Rom: Spaceknight, Iron Man and Judge Dredd. The story is relatively simple, telling of police officer Alex J Murphy who is critically wounded/nearly dead after his first assignment as part of the Detroit police force. Omni Consumer Products (OCP) has entered a deal with Detroit's government to try and clean up the city of crime, and they choose to ressurect Murphy as the cyborg Robocop. There's tons of great ultraviolent fight scenes with Robocop, and the fact that robocop has an extra mechanical device where his middle finger should be. Murphy lacks a lot of his original memories but slowly regains them as becomes more human once again. Unfortunately, Robocop's designer, Robert "Bob" Morton, is killed by OCP's Senior Vice President Richard "Dick" Jones, who wanted his giant robot ED-209 to be the police and military tool of choice. Robocop tries to arrest Dick but can't as his 4th "[Classified]" directive is Any attempt to arrest a senior OCP employee results in shutdown. Fortunately, the Old man CEO fires Dick after Robocop shows them a video of Dick confessing to Bob's murder. The Old Man thanks RoboCop for his good shooting and then asks what his name is; RoboCop smiles, removes his helmet and answers, "Murphy", showing his regained humanity. Robocop is a lot of fun and also has a serious message at heart, about the difficulties the police face as well as media influence, gentrification, corruption, authoritarianism, greed, privatization, capitalism, identity, and human nature. The parody commercials are hilarious (although I feel Nuke'm may seem superfluous if you know there is a card game called Nuclear War and its expansion/spin-off Nuclear Escalation, both of which were out at the time). The special effects are still good and hold up today. An 80s classic that still holds up today.

Exciting that 70s show spin off where Eric's dad hustles hard on the side which makes you wonder why they're always freaking out about money and he's always calling Eric a dumbass instead of just thrusting a shotgun into his piddly little face and bellowing BITCHES LEAVE whenever Kelso and Hyde come over
An 80's classic that don't get less enjoyable and fun over the years. Dope fun any time.
Doing a watch through of Verhoeven. I have a copy of Elle waiting to be watched, but I also got a blu of this over the weekend and it was only right for me to watch it again. The best action movie, the best Verhoeven, the best everything.
this was a fun 80s cocaine fueled schlock fest and i enjoyed every minute of it
I propose a Robocop drinking game. Take a shot everytime somebody goes through a window/glass door. You will be fucking trashed by the end. Also, I miss 1980s action films where there is violence, blood, corporate bad guys and toxic waste.
Really strong action direction, consistently funny Loved the classic old-school baddies Great one liners Iconic props, fucking love good props the 3000 SUX or whatever, very nice
I still can't believe how perfect this movie is. I wish Ed Neumeier, Michael Miner, and Paul Verhoeven would get together again for a note-perfect prognostication of the future because this one's now out of date -- uncannily prescient for more than 20 years into the future, but we now have an even more unpredictable dystopia ahead of us. What will 2038 hold? I don't know. I'm sure it'll be godawful. I could talk (and have talked) at greater length about this gem, but instead I'll just say that this movie makes me sympathize and root for a totally sociopathic corporate executive (Bob Morton as played by the incredible late Miguel Ferrer) and our boy Alex Murphy (Peter Weller), a cop who crosses the picket line.
I’d buy that for a dollar
This just might be the most 80s action movie to have ever 80s action movied. I recently introduced myself to Paul Verhoeven's work with his recent venture, Elle, but this was so extraordinarily different that it's quite frankly absurd. Usually one can detect some general technical/narrative connections in a director's oeuvre, but where Elle is a slow paced, starkly realistic character study, RoboCop is a bloody, cheesy, piece of entertainment that fit perfectly into the cultural zeitgeist of its time. It's funny how good this movie is without having any real good performances, except for Kurtwood Smith as the brutally evil Clarence Boddicker. Peter Weller was fine in the leading role, but was offered very little character development other than the fact that he had a wife and son. Joel Kinnaman's portrayal in the 2014 remake was much more impressive on this front. Everyone else from plucky cops led by an angry black captain to some generic goons were pretty by the numbers. This film's strength is twofold, it's screenplay and its production. The dystopian Detroit seen in this film is excellently realised, with all the sets feeling perfectly grimy and lived in. On a budget of $13 million, it's immensely impressive, from the makeup and costumes to the stopmotion robots. It's level of violence and blood-squibs is almost parodic, and make for incredibly entertaining action cinema. When I saw the Robocop remake, I was surprised to see the blatant political undertones. I believed that it was just trying to be relevant, and had no idea that the original was, in addition to being a balls-to-the-wall action film, a damning social critique. This film was written by Edward Neumeier and Michael Miner, and their screenplay is an effective reflection of the Cold War era, satirising the military industrial complex, consumerism, social decay and much more. It has all the rage and scorn behind it of a young generation seeing where society is potentially headed and while it can be a little on the nose from time to time, it never interfered with its impact. I enjoyed this far more than I was expecting to, and will definitely seek it out on home video. It's a brilliant capturing of a time, both in the film industry and in the real world, subtextually.
RoboCop does not pass the Bechdel Test :/
well... there was a robo and a cop
Thoughts: 1. Robocop fucking bangs 2. It’s interesting how this film mirrors the rhythms and tone of the great cyberpunk animes coming out of Japan at the same time. 3. This becomes more and more like a documentary every passing year 4. Robocop fucking BANGS
What a fucking movie
RoboCop is the action movie equivalent of a really good, prescient Onion article; it strikes an undeniable nerve and speaks directly to the heart of our culture. Also, it seems more real and relevant than it should. The movie just doesn't seem to age. No matter the time in my own personal life, or the culture I find myself in the midst of, the deep, pointed satire about consumerism, corporate culture, and the brutality in which those things operate, always seems to hit home. It's such a perfect meeting of artists: Paul Verhoeven is firing on all cylinders, Ed Neumeier's script is the perfect canvas, the suit transcends the medium and takes on a pop-myth quality, and Peter Weller gives a truly incredible and idiosyncratic performance. And I haven't even mentioned some of the amazing effects work, that not only set an industry standard for the time but also (mostly) holds up incredibly well. I mean, the chemically melted thug is as gruesome as it has ever been. I could go on and on about this one, but I'll just leave it here for now. God damn, is RoboCop a good time, this is definitely true, but it never settles for being just an "entertaining" piece of cinematic ephemera. Modern genre filmmakers should take note.
Watched on Hulu (with Mom).
It's hard to separate myself from my younger self and the love I felt for it at the time, but I can't help but have a great time every time I watch this movie.
Mostly holds up despite all the satire about the state of television ads, entertainment, and privatization being very nearly modern reality. Still a lot of fun, and has great performances all around.
I mean... it's all there.
I have no idea why I had never seen this movie before, but I can see why it's so acclaimed. It's violent and clever, but it's still able to create great characters. The villains are great and intimidating and the theme is still stuck in my head. I loved it
Great movie, it was gruesome in quite a few scenes but it never qualifies for gore. Robocop definitely has resting zack face take a picture of zack and you will see it too. It was a great movie, no one could figure out to shoot him in the mouth or visor though which was kind of infuriating though. I would definitely watch this movie again because it was great.
No fun until Robocop shows up, which fortunately isn't long, then it's a lot of fun. Also love how the film is just one giant shat on Reagan's Star Wars program. Great score too.
A classic ahead of its time. ✊🏻
Ultraviolent. Firmly a film of it's time. Not so subtle satire. But RoboCop just works!
You make a lot of my friends nervous. A lot of people... would love to see a guy like me... put a guy like you out of business.  Best robot movie of all time.
Robocop and Predator are two very similar films. They were both released in 1987. They both feature unique settings and fantastical science fiction characters. They both relied on heavy special effects back in the day. They’re also both incredibly boring. In the case of Robocop, At least it has ingenuity. A police officer named Alex Murphy lives in an apocalyptic... Chicago? Detroit? I don’t remember off the top of my head, but it’s apocalyptic for reasons unexplained. He ultimately gets barraged with bullets and is reanimated in electrical steel armor, cyborg style. Then, he continues for the rest of the hour and a half bringing criminals, and the main antagonist (the dad from That 70’s Show) to justice, encapsulating the ‘American way.’ It’s not a bad idea, and at least the events that occur in Robocop have become iconic. It doesn’t have much else going for it in terms of achievement or lasting critical acclaim. The special effects in particular, which I’m sure were fantastic back then, are appallingly bad. This is why movies with extreme special effects are less likely to be received critically. Unless you have the trademark effects in Star Wars or Raiders of the Lost Ark that have become synonymous with their respective franchises, it’s safer to stay away from the newest wave of special effects. There will always be new developments in effects that will make older ones outdated. Robocop went all out, and is now experiencing the consequences. Aside from this, the movie is cheesy. Not in the endearing way used to describe other more beloved films, but in a way that makes you cringe. The acting is sub par, and although the plot is extravagant enough to be genuinely interesting, they fail to make it resonate with viewers.
30 years later and it's still the most accurate depiction of Detroit.
Awesome. Awesome to the max.
Robocop sits in a decade filled with incredible action films, but it sticks out and remains memorable 30 years on. Despite a slew of bad sequels, a mediocre remake and a reputation of dated ness, Robocop stands as a definitive film for the action fan. Crisp action sequences, great effects (for the time), and dark satire (even though it’s pretty on the nose..) push robocop into that upper echolon. Peter Weller and Kurtwood Smith play off of each other wonderfully in between blasts of ridiculous violence and a surprising human touch. Easily Paul Verhoeven’s masterpiece.
I'm just going to take a wild guess about what the Robocop remake changed, and probably got wrong in the process. - An unprecedented bulletproof robotic cop has fights with street thugs that last more than twenty seconds - A central performance that isn't physically stiff but still completely holds the screen at every second - Murphy gets back in touch with his family - Shorter scenes of Boddicker's gang just hanging out and being slime - Not abruptly ending as soon as possible
My expectations weren't especially high for Robocop. On the surface, it really looks like another mindless 80's shoot-em'-up. That couldn't be further from the truth! It's a smart, self-aware movie, with witty social commentary and great characters, it's emotionally investing, and the truly kickass action scenes are just the icing on the cake! If only more action films were like this one. The violence is hard-hitting, the special effects are great, and it's an absolute blast from start to finish. And the ending is just the best!
