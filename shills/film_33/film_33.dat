Awful. Just awful.  Boring, cringey, crap dialogue, humour doesn’t work... need I go on?
Dc has given up of classic formule of films and adopted the Marvel style and work very well . But as nothing is perfect, the biggest flaw of the movie is the soundtrack that simply doesnt match .
Aquaman and the half-blood prince
That Trench sequence... What a visual feast.
You have to admire the cast for being 100% on board for a script this cheesy and ridiculous, but it's that conviction that carries the film through its messier parts. Patrick Wilson deserves some sort of award for delivering the line "YOU CAN CALL ME... OCEANMASTER!" without even cracking a smile. So is it good? No. Is it fun? Yes. And plenty colourful. An enjoyable fantasy romp even if it does leave you feeling like you just deep-throated a camenbert cheese wheel.
I think Raj (from the Big Bang Theory) owes Aquaman a full engraved apology! This film was not bad. Some bits were rather cheesy, but the action in it were rather pretty good. And the post credit scene...mind-blowing! Plus, Jason Mamoa as Aquaman real made the franchise so bad ass that it brought all them haters to shame. Also, Amber Heard looked pretty hot as a redhead! All in all, while some fans will debate whether or not this was a good or bad film, I am definitely rating this mother f***er a decent 4 stars!
It’s alright, it’s not like most people hype it up to be.  I know the reason for this hype is that it’s been so long since people had seen a good DC film.  I’m just gonna get down to the brass tacks. Positives: 1) Jason Mamoa. 2) Nicole Kidman. 3) Fight Choreography. 4) Visual Effects. 5) Ooooh, that kiss. Negatives: 1) 2-Dimensional Villian. 2) Scenes that could’ve cut down. 3) Way to hyped up music. 4) Confusing World Buliding. 5) Poor Jokes, the theatre was not laughing at all. 6) Abrupt & very distracting cuts during fight scenes. 7) Post Credits scene which ruins the ending of the film. Final Thoughts: Nonetheless, still a good DC movie after a long time. It’s worth the ticket as a entertainer but not as a superhero entertainment.
A very solid first outing in the fantasy blockbuster realm for James Wan. Some CGI was a bit wonky, and a decent whack of the dialogue is a bit cringey, possibly due to the source material (sorry, I can't take the title of OCEAN MASTER seriously, no matter how stone-faced you play it) - but overall it's a fun popcorn romp with some spectacular action scenes.
Laser sharks Vs Crabs 3D accidentally does more for gay pride than every film made before its existence...
This is some absolutely fucking ridiculous cheese, the most camp thing I have seen in a long time. Your standard superhero bloated bullshit but filtered through the likes of Star Wars, Power Rangers/Inframan, Indiana Jones/Tomb Raider/Uncharted/Tintin, every saturday morning cartoon you can think of and a bunch of other weird stuff. I can't lie, I kinda enjoy this...
After a shaky introduction involving Nicole Kidman & Temuera Morrison, 'Aquaman' bursts into life with the appearance of Jason Momoa. The charisma and commitment that he brings to the role really compliments the material. His interactions with the supporting cast are sublime and his psychical presence adds a sense of legitimacy to the set-pieces. Unlike with the character's parents, I believed the chemistry between Arthur & Mera. Whilst Momoa does most of the heavy lifting, Amber Heard does a very good job of complimenting his performance. In fact, I think it's safe to say that this is her finest role to date.  Patrick Wilson & Yahya Abdul-Mateen II provide strong villainous turns. Similarly to Michael Shannon's, Zod they both have a strong motivation that you can sympathise with. For a villain to work, I believe that is one of the fundamental aspects and director James Wan understands that.  With so much absurdity taking place on screen, industry veterans, Willem Dafoe & Dolph Lundgren do a terrific job in helping to endorse the world of Atlantis. 'Wonder Woman' composer, Rupert Gregson Williams' pulsating electronic beats guide us through this magnificently constructed underwater landscape. Borrowing heavily from 'Blade Runner 2049', 'Jupiter Ascending', 'The Abyss' & 'Pacific Rim' (to name a few), Wan wears his influences on his sleeve whilst simultaneously bringing something fresh to the screen. It's the sort of visual extravaganza that makes you want to freeze-frame certain sequences and observe all the minuet details that dwell in the background, capitalising on every cent of it's $200 million budget. With the aid of fight choreographers, Wan demonstrates a natural gift for shooting action. As someone who has grown increasingly frustrated with the lack of light and reliance on shaky cam, I really admired how 'Aquaman' chooses to go wide seamlessly cutting together footage in order to create the illusion that it was shot in one take. It makes the combat scenes feel more visceral and it's great to see what is actually happening.  Featuring some witty one-liners, the film doesn't go overboard with it's humour. Despite having a sense of ridiculousness the film remains grounded and doesn't feel like a cog in the corporate wheel. After the mishap that was, 'Justice League' hopefully Warner Bros. are learning not to rely so heavily on connectivity. The fact that they were willing to release an unedited 143 minute cut theatrically suggests that they may be learning from past mistakes.  After suffering from tentpole fatigue, 'Aquaman' is the kick up the ass that I needed in order to reinvigorate my enjoyment of this franchise. I admired the preposterousness and devoured the world building. As an indication into the future of DC, I'm back on board. James Wan has done a terrific job of realising this character and I really hope that he returns for the sequel.
Aquaman is a bloody good time at the cinemas. It's hella cheesy but it's also extremely fun
this is the most crackhead shit ive ever seen
genuinely only good when nicole kidman is there, the rest was just okay at best. the script was often laughably cringe and would definitely have benefitted from being trimmed down quite a bit but overall....... fine.  side note: WHAT THE HELL WAS ANNABELLE DOING JUST CHILLING AT THE BOTTOM OF THE OCEAN???
Damn, the best DCEU film since... fucking Man of Steel?
can't wait for aquaman 2: desolation of seaworld
Okay, personally here's my take on the DC vs Marvel films. DC is not Marvel and Marvel is not DC. DC has it's own way of telling stories, wherein the DC universe goes for the serious, dark, and grand ways of story-telling/scenes, whereas Marvel goes for the light-hearted, humor-filled, fun method. The thing is, most people will go for the fun ones, which is unfortunate for the DC Universe. From my take, they are trying to stick with reality--on what is a most likely scenario[s] if super heroes do really exist. As for the film itself. I liked it. I'm not a film enthusiast to explain the technicalities nor even noticed them, but I'm a casual movie go-er, and this is how I experienced it. Anyhow, It felt like they went overboard in some of the scenes, but those are scenes I liked the most. I've always had a difficult time trying to choose which super hero I like the most, like how kids will fight over which supers they want, how some people are a fan of Batman (I know a couple of friends), the Flash (my brother), and Captain America (online friend), while I couldn't decide which. Now I know which super I like, and it's Aquaman. <3
honestly the first half of the film i was bored and wasn’t enjoying it, but the second half really picked up. jason mamoa is the absolute perfect casting for aquaman. and i haven’t seen much of amber heard before, but she was really great here, easily one of the best parts of the film and i will definitely be looking out for her in other films. one big negative for this film for me is the cgi, i feel like considering where we are in time, and when you look at other films that have come out recently it really wasn’t very good. not the best film of the year by a long shot but overall i enjoyed it.
Great movie. Unfortunately the soundtrack is kinda poor compared to the greatness of the story. The villain has such a good motivation that you can easily relate to him and it really adds a lot to the whole movie. Also, the interactions between the Aquaman and the other characters are well-developed. Really good
While it’s visually stunning and appealing, the main weight of the movie isn’t felt due to the lack of conflict and stakes. The antagonist is weak with unclear motives that doesn’t drive the movie forward but hinders the movie from going anywhere deep or special. Jason Momoa as Aquaman while being a master at the art of action as a character still needs to work on the humor aspect. The 3rd act was underwhelming and yet again another CGI battle sequence for the sake of having a CGI battle sequence. Aquaman is a one time watch, breathtaking visualls but lacks the sense of being a movie.  To quote a friend, “Black Panther but instead of race its about environmental issues”
I was so hyped for this movie that I was afraid my expectations where so high I would end up being disappointed. But no, I had so much fun watching this. Nicole Kidman as Atlanna was so beautifully done, the first 10 min are so pleasing, and Yahya Abdul-Mateen II as Black Manta was another highlight for me. Amber Heard is perfectly cast as Mera. It's like all these characters jumped out of a comic. When Aquaman dons his costume it is truly magnificent. If you are a comic book fan you really appreciates what they have done with it. The movie is a lot of cgi but all nicely done. Atlantis is stunning just like the vehicles and all of the creatures. The costumes are magnificent. All the action scenes are marvelous, the ones under water and the ones on land. It is something you haven't seen before. The final battle was a little bit too much for me because I didn't really see the point of it but besides that everything was eye-candy. The score of the final trailer is not in the movie, too bad because it is one of the most epic movie scores out there. So lets explore Atlantis and the other kingdoms more because we saw too little of them and bring on Aquaman II
naming my first born after james wan
not amazing but very fun
pros:  - nicole kidman as Queen Atlanna - nicole kidman kicking ass - nicole kidman cons;  - everything else
If Nicole Kidman was my mom and she got deserted, I'd have revenge and try to become the king of the ocean too bitch.
Was only watching this for Jason Momoa, but damn- Nicole Kidman kicks some ass! And I do love some Willem Dafoe! Some corny scenes and lines of dialogue, jokes and gags that were hit and miss, but that was to be expected.  Watched this on Screen X and was pleasantly surprised.
10/10: Hats off to director James Wan. He can create a world and tales of various genres - adventure, love, superhero, action, horror and epic battles all in a single movie!!! Finally a movie that not only DC fanboy deserves, but everyone, even for the non-comic fans. Beautiful cinematography, visuals, costumes designs and bad-ass villains. One of the best movie in 2018!
Campy in all the right ways that Captain America: The First Avenger (and uhm Suicide Squad) wasn't. Also, Patrick Wilson is always always great, Amber Heard is stunning, the CGI looks straight from a video game (jarring initially but kinda cool halfway through), the stunt choreography is excellent, Arthur finally doesn't come across as buffoonish as he did in JL, the dialogue is incredibly cheesy at most points, it's kind of like the reverse Black Panther, but god damn was it fun.
An absolute blast: fun, goofy, absurd, and about five different films stuffed into one green and gold outfit. I want a sequel that is just Arthur & Mera: Action archeologists.
The King has Risen. Aquaman is a huge cheesy spectacle that you don't want to miss. A visually stunning of a film with a little bit of everything; Adventure, Fantasy, Romance, Horror, Comedy, and Action. Not only this film shows you the beauty of the deep blue sea, it also features how terrifying it could be. Certainly doesn't disappoint. James Wan delivered more than what we expected. In Wan We Trust, indeed.
Mad as a box of frogs but it’s fun
Now I understand why we should appreciate Kokoh Wan.
Pure entertainment. Aquaman overcomes a clunky narrative and cliched dialogue with terrific action scenes, especially those taking place underwater, that benefit a lot from fluid camerawork. The IMAX 3D is a bit murky, but the fact that roughly 80% of the scenes were filmed in IMAX’s expanded aspect ratio makes it completely worth it. This is another win for DCEU, which I believe is on the right track to resurrect itself following the Justice League debacle. James Wan finally makes Aquaman a “cool” superhero worthy of standing alongside Wonder Woman, not a useless dude who got his ass kicked in most of his own scenes in Justice League. The movie finds the charm in its leads. Momoa as Aquaman has more charisma than Cavill and Affleck as their respective characters combined. His hair-flip is already more memorable than them. Amber Heard and Patrick Wilson got some awful lines, but they’re good. Nicole Kidman has this ethereal aura that makes her casting perfect. Could’ve been about 20 minutes shorter. It honestly felt like 3 hours. But boy did I have a blast! The underwater duel between Arthur and King Arm in the middle of the movie and the climatic battle are some epic stuff. Overall a decent film. Makes me excited for DCEU again. 2018 releases ranked
Best DCEU movie so far. Eventough the CGI is shit, the story and the message on it really are that good. James Wan also did not lose his horror's identity and succeed on putting a little bit horror sense to this film through the score. A job well done !
Everything in this movie is fucking hilarious, the best dc film by far :))
If not for the atrocious dialogues, totally misplaced music choices and some bad editing that ruined some really good action choreographies this could have been a lot better. The visual effects were great, Jason Momoe was charming, Amber Heard had a pretty good role and Patrick Wilson and his character was not utilised enough. The tone of the film was all over the place but it was entertaining throughout the runtime.
I had a lot of fun with it, it goes for colorful and silly with all it has and the result is a very entertaining and well done movie. I really liked what they did with Black Manta, more than anything the way they introduce him and his conflict with Arthur, and there is also Patrick Wilson, he was quite good as Orm, I don't know that much about him in the comics, but in here a lot of how he is written could of made for a pretty much generic and bland villain, an asshole for the sake of asshole, but Wilson does a lot to add more to him and it makes for a bit more complex and compelling bad guy. The movie actually starts quite well, and with a fast space, is the second act where things stop moving that quickly, going for a more generic quest plot, and its ok but it looses something and is not only momentum. Beyond that, it can be a bit too silly at times, but even then it doesn't really stop being fun, even when it gets awkward. Although it nearly lost me with that Pitbull song, I'm a reasonable man but everyone has their limits. Some things, like the romance subplot are kind of trite, but done ok, as i said, is a well done movie, and part of that, is that it knows when to try to lean into the silly to make something more enjoyable. Despite some fake looking background in the desert bit, the effects are really good, and the look Atlantis and the world under the sea are one of the best things about the movie if not the best, is simply breathtakingly beautiful and you feel the weight of a completely different and massive world. The action is also really good, but thats kind of the point. The movie goes for epic and for spectacle and it manages it quite well, being one of the main reason why I enjoyed it. Sure it doesn't always knows how to balance the silly tone, and in part it fells like DC overcompensating for all the complaints about their past movies and the bleak, joyless tone of them. But the result is not a bad one but actually a really fun movie. It doesn't really tries to be anything else and. as i said before, it goes for colorful and silly without shame, and yes it may not be a perfect or above average superhero flick, but it is a good and fun example of the genre and I'm happy I saw It.
Such a fun film.  The most surprising part was the fact that the tone with this character was very consistent between the films directed by different directors.    Stunning visuals. The underwater sequences, whether it be fights or just conversations looked great.  Characters were well done and all followed the motivations clearly laid out for them from the beginning of the film.
I don't know what more people expect out of dumb, superhero movies.
Aquaman is a movie about a half atlantean named Arthur Curry and this is where it really starts to fall apart. Arthur, despite what this film wants you to believe is not a cool name. it doesn't sound cool when Nicole Kidman says it and it doesn't sound cool when Dolph Lundgren says it. all I could think of was the cartoon aardvark who as charming as he may have been, was not cool. his last name being Curry could go either way but it is nowhere near cool enough to salvage a name like Arthur. you could argue it's an homage to the historical King Arthur and I could argue that his name was uncool too. awful start. also it's ugly and boring and aggressively unfunny and all the character work is painfully dull.
The beginning of the movie was kind of overwhelming, and the resolution part was pretty much '...what, that's it?' Some scenes are just too cringe-worthy, specifically the Arthur-Mera ones.... Nevertheless, the action scene was fairly good to watch. The trench battle was successfully excruciating. I liked the jokes though. 'I could just piss on it' was my favorite.
DC finally got it right, entertainment that people deserve. With Thor 3-style journey and epic battles, I believe in James Wan.
Great action. Decent acting. Looks like a video game sometimes, but in a good way. Fun and entertaining.
The opening to this film instantly throws you into the story, the action, and the worst soundtrack ever I really think they could of changed the music up a bit more, James Wan didn’t do a bad job though the action and fighting in this film was well shot and choreographed. No one was killed of though : (
tbh, gotta admit, one of the better DC films in awhile. I get why people think its shitty but at the same time there is a large audience who will sit in the theatre and truly enhoy this and i get that. The visuals and soundtracks were often captivating despite some odd cuts that most would have probably noticed. A movie to watch with your family and friends but definitely not film critiques. IM JUST PUTTING IT OUT THERE THAT THIS FILM IS PRETTY AWESOME VISUALLY.
I liked this but I don’t know where the rave reviews are coming from. It’s good but it’s not that good. I suppose compared with the DCEU’s other offerings anything good from them will be hailed as a masterpiece.  The action sequences are very enjoyable, the jokes are a little hit and miss and there’s not a single “Mah man!” to be heard, take that as a positive or a negative.  Overall, it’s up there with Wonder Woman, and hopefully Shazam! 🤞 Will I buy it? [inset water based pun that means yes]
say whatever you want about dc films but the scores fucking slap
sluggish and sloppy but very fun.  WOMEN ARE THE GODTIER CREATURES HUH?
This movie is comprised of all the bright colours couldn't find any dull darker colour.
DC did not disappoint with this one, its a visual marvel and a feast for the eyes though, some parts were rushed related to the plot but overall its wonderful.
On land talking about family and searching for lost treasure, while at sea talking about seizing the Ocean Master. Both are combined with harmony by James Wan.
Jason Momoa is born to play this role.
Very good movie with amazing underwater effects. Now when everyone agrees that it's the best DC movie after Wonder Woman, see the similarities in both the movies, both are colorful and vibrant not dark like the other duller DC movies. James Wan definitely made a good movie and it was a very speedy time pass movie. I watched Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse first and then after a small break I saw this movie. Go watch them both they both are worthwhile movies.
This was definitely one of the most captivating movies I've watched in this quarter of 2018. With this year being Marvel's year when it comes to Superhero films, DC needed a lot to catch up on, and I feel like Aquaman hit that note perfectly in terms of what its needed for DC to catch up on. While it had some flaws and inconsistencies when it came to some of the dialogues and plotline, some of the hot moments definitely gave some intense eye candy and distract me from criticizing it as much (👀) Visually though, this just reminds me of how Lord of The Rings would be if it's set underwater. The visuals and graphics of this movie are amazing on all levels and most importantly, it was tastefully done. This is unlike some movies where they would make the CGI look cheap as hell or overdo it. The various sea creatures that made its appearance in the film felt realistic as well. Another aspect that made me happy was the portrayal of Aquaman in this movie as well. Over the years, Aquaman has always been counted as a joke in various media outlets and his character has always been downplayed. But this movie showcased a different side of him to a wider audience and a more serious (yet still fun) side to him as well. This is definitely the best DC movie since Wonder Woman, which was back in 2016. Although that's not saying much, it shows that the DC universe is still somewhat redeemable. This gives me hope for more DC movies to come, especially with Shazam!, Birds of Prey and Wonder Woman 1984.
for me, it's one of DC comics best movies yet (but not better than Wonder Woman). the movie started bad but it's getting better during the second act and the third act it's the best and you finish the movie with a great feeling and reconsiders all the script fails and the bad acting from the main characters.
Redheads, you gotta love em!  just when i thought the scene where arthur and mera emerge from water to the tune of ocean to ocean.mp3 was the sexiest moment in cinema 2018, the wine scene came in and so did i   this was off to a mediocre start but it progressively gets So Much better and the visuals were stunning. the concept of people riding seahorses was bonkers but boy we sure love to have fun. i almost yelled “I THOUGHT THIS MOVIE WAS ABOUT FISH RIGHTS” when nicole kidman swallowed a goldfish.   also....... miss amber heard i’m free on tuesday night if you wanna go for a swim drink wine maybe idk i’m free call me
What an epic apik aquashow for an Aquaman.
Most of the dialogue in the first hour is unnatural exposition. Words fly by. Many, many words. "Ocean Master"? But James Wan can film a fight scene. But don't expect anything particularly original. But a lot of it looks really cool. Really, really cool. and James Wan can film a fight scene. Pretty reasonable environmental message. I stuck around for the credits, and it turns out there were a few digital effects... I kind of loved it...
AQUAMAN is a epic adventure with great characters and a markable script. the visual effects are INSANE, and i’ve never had seen something like this since the lord of the rings and avatar. momoa, heard, kidman, wilson and dafoe are great together. the production design is beautiful, and james wan directly this film very well. the only problem for me was the soundtrack - sometimes, during a dramatic scene, a stupid teenager song starts in the background. i love it, congrats dc!
Old fashioned superhero tale with infectious energy. Meaty and gigantic action. A high watermark for the DCEU.
nicole kidman and amber heard just said the future is women!
The entire movie was about Jason Momoa finding a thing (a treasure), but he doesn't realise that he is the real treasure to us.
Acid trip underwater (above the water as well). It is both completely earnest and ridiculous; but it looks and feels like a comic book. Great cast too. I had too much fun to care about "flaws".
everybody say thank you amber heard and nicole kidman
This movie is crazy. Completely bonkers and all over the place. Very entertaining! It is a lot of fun and has amazing special effects, with great action sequences. It doesn't take itself too seriously, and knows how ridiculous it is, but still manages to get across an important environmental message without being too heavy handed about it. The score is good, and helps the movie feel more epic, but there are some questionable choices in terms of use of pop songs. I would say that the dialog isn't great, and there are so many action sequences that you never really get time to breath or to get to know the characters. This movie is really non-stop action! Overall, I would say it's a very fun watch, definitely to be seen on the big screen!
my main takeaway: jesus can turn water into wine but amber heard can turn wine into flying knives
Throughout the movie I can't help but think that this movie is actually a reverse-Black Panther. It's almost the same: both are about an outsider who have came into the kingdom to try to take the crown from the reigning king. The difference is that in Black Panther, that outsider is the villain and lost, while in Aquaman that outsider is the hero and won. I haven't watched Thor, but I suppose there are similar elements there too as well? Is that how kingdom-themed movie works? Anyways, I think Aquaman is amazing and enjoyable, much more than Justice League. I kinda prefer this than Wonder Woman too. I'm glad that they gave some comedy to Arthur's personality. Mera is a badass, love her hair, I think she's the most vibrant female character in any superhero movie I've ever seen. Overall this movie is refreshing. Oh and that giant crab reminds me of that giant crab from Moana who was voiced by Jemaine Clement. I kinda expected him/her to sing "Shiny" at some point in the movie.
Aquaman is a colorful and well actions packed movie. The casts are good, audiences will definitely get captivated by Jason Momoa’s charisma, Amber Heard’s beauty. James Wan is great, he has integrated those good elements in his previous film: epic single-shot action sequences and even some of horror elements into this movie. Although it is 145min movie, but you will never feel bored, it’s entertaining with adventurous plot. For the cgi aspect, it gives us the most vibrant underwater world, however people will getting tired with the use of too much of cgi. Another downside of this movie are some of dialogues are too common which we can found in rpg games and the Princess Hera role, I just felt a bit weird as she just leaving King Orm and goes with Arthur, also is the one who potentially be the king of Atlantis.
A bit disappointing to be honest. Good action scenes as you'd expect but felt forced in the majority. An octopus playing a drum really took me out of it.
The lows were so low, the highs were so high Visually spectacular, magnificent world building, the action is really well directed and for the amount of CGI, not that heavy handed, some moments were pure adventurous joy and shiver, the humor almost NEVER landed, the dialogue and acting is slender man bad In the end i really love this and was very sad that the horrible dialogue and humour prevented this to become a instant classic
So this movie was… decent? Good? Entertaining? Well that's unexpected. Let me start by saying, that I have a strange relationship with the DCEU (or whatever the nam is) Batman v Superman was a convoluted mess, Suicide Squad was on of the worst movies I have ever seen, Justice League was a clash of thirty visions. And I'm in a minority, when I say, that I find Wonder Woman boring. The only other movie I liked in this series so far was Man of Steel. Aquaman is a nice change of pace and tone. After the slow and dark entries preceding it, it's a quick and lighthearted adventure, that doesn't take itself very seriously. Which is good thing for a movie about a guy, who talks to fish. The visual effects are nice, although sometimes not perfect. It's not as bad as Justice League though. There is colour and even when the CG is bad it's never awful. And Atlantis looks gorgeous. The performances are all fine. Jason Momoa is very likeable and charismatic and I buy him as Arthur Curry/Aquaman. He sold even some of the more corny dialogue. The rest is good. Willem Dafoe is always a plus, Amber Heard was fine, Patrick Wilson's Ocean Master was a pretty decent villain. The guy who plays Black Manta (sorry, I don't remember his name) was good, but other people seem to like him more than I do. If they bring him back for a sequel, he could be even better. Aquaman is a movie with a story we have seen done before, with archetypes we have seen before. I, however, didn't mind that. It was entertaining and it wasn't trying to be much more (ehm, BvS, ehm). I will watch this one again for sure.
There is no denying that Aquaman is a damn fun visual spectacle of a superhero action adventure film even if its a flawed one. Its worth watching on IMAX for its fantastic underwater visual effects and action sequences alone. A lot of visual imagination is put into the underwater city of Atlantis. The action sequences are beautifully shot and you have a lot of different action set pieces that are a marvel to watch at the big screen. Aquaman is an ambitiously large scale film, that tries to go through a lot of world building and backstories. Even at 2 hours 22 minutes, it feels like the film rushed up some of it by mere exposition to save time. The large scale nature of the film makes it feel a bit messy at times even if its basic story is simple. The age old story of two brothers fighting for the throne one may have seen or read multiple times. This one done in a reverse of the way Black Panther did. Jason Momoa is perfect as the macho hero and has his roguish charm that carries the film. Amber Heard as Mera is jaw dropping smoking hot rocking the red hair sharing a nice chemistry with the hero. The climatic final battle is pretty epic. Comparisons to Avatar are warranted in regards to its CGI and world building. Its kinda sad and ironic that the Aquaman movie in DCEU feels the more grander and epic than Justice League.
As of late, the films featured in the DC Extended Universe (DCEU) have received a lot of criticism. Only ‘Wonder Woman’, which was released last year, has been successful in terms of praise from both critics and audiences. ‘Justice League’, which was released at the end of last year, was poorly received and didn’t impress at the box office. Because of this, the upcoming release of ‘Aquaman’ left many doubtful if it would be any good. However, since its release, it’s received mostly positive reviews from critics who were pleasantly surprised. We first saw a glimpse of Jason Momoa’s Aquaman (real name Arthur Curry) when he made a cameo in ‘Batman V Superman: Dawn Of Justice’. He then appeared in ‘Justice League’ where we saw more of him in action, however, we didn’t know much about his background. While ‘Aquaman’ is set following the events of ‘Justice League’, we see glimpses of Arthur’s life as a child and how his parents met. Because his mother, Atlanna (Nicole Kidman), was the Queen of Atlantis, and his father, Thomas, was human, their relationship was forbidden and, not long after Arthur’s birth, Atlanna is forced to return to Atlantis. While ‘Aquaman’ isn’t a perfect film, it is entertaining. Those who haven’t seen any of the previous films in the DCEU needn’t worry as it works as a stand-alone superhero film. The story focuses on Aquaman and none of the other superheroes make appearances. I think that, prior to its release, people were expecting ‘Aquaman’ to be another disappointment, like ‘Justice League’ and ‘Batman v Superman’, however, it proved to be a pleasant surprise. Unlike the aforementioned films, ‘Aquaman’ isn’t trying to be a serious film and has a light tone to it. It’s just a lot of fun and is one of those films you can just sit back and enjoy. Momoa proves to be a great choice to portray Aquaman as he brings charisma to the role and makes him a likeable protagonist. He is also impressive in the fighting sequences and captures the strength. Solid supporting roles come from Kidman as his mother, Amber Heard as Mera, who is an Atlantian and Arthur’s friend, Willem Dafoe as Nuidis Vulko, Atlantis' counselor who would become a mentor of Arthur Curry when he first comes to Atlantis, and Patrick Wilson as Arthur’s half-brother, Orm, the current ruler of Atlantis and the main antagonist. The performances aren’t Oscar-worthy but that’s to be expected with a superhero film, however, the cast give solid performances. The films in the DCEU have been criticised for its reliance on computer-generated imagery (CGI), however, the visuals for ‘Aquaman’ are impressive and effectively bring the world of Atlantis to life. On filming underwater sequences, the director, James Wan, stated that "the underwater world is super complicated" and "it's not an easy shoot". Because of the hard work that went into creating the underwater sequences, the scenes set underwater look really good. I think that the problem people make with the films in the DCEU is that they compare them to the films in the Marvel Cinematic Universe which I don’t think they should do as, aside from the fact they’re all superhero films, they’re different in terms of tone and style. The films in the MCU are better, in terms of story, characters and CGI, however, for me, personally, I find the films in the DCEU more enjoyable to watch as they don’t take themselves seriously and are a load of fun. Those going into ‘Aquaman’ expecting something among the levels of one of the MCU films will be disappointed. Prior to watching ‘Aquaman’, I wasn’t expecting much as I wasn’t sure a stand-alone Aquaman film would work, however, I was pleasantly surprised.
Brilliant story great cast and really think they going be aquaman 2
i can't believe that the worst dc cómics character became the fucking best and has the most AMAZING movie. dc, say thank u jason momoa
Finally dc made a good superheor movie. Watching this also remembering me to mcu movies phase 1
amber heard and nicole kidman please step on me
the movie was quite long Jason Momoa a super manly Aquaman, phenomenal! *hats off Amber Heard with her redhead effortlessly stole the show! can't take my eyes off her . The visual effect of under the ocean scenes were outstanding! I stated that THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST DC MOVIE I'VE EVER WATCHED *big applause! 👏👏👏
Before I thought this film could be anymore of a super-entertaining shitpost, a cover of Africa by Toto plays over a scene transition into the Sahara Desert had me fucking wheezing in the theatre. The real question, however, is whether or not that's too big a spoiler to matter but it's more to alert what you're getting yourself into.
great film with an amazing cinematography and fantastic action sequences! james wan has done it again! i love seeing successful malaysians! also is it just me or does aquaman’s suit lowkey look like barnacle boy from spongebob squarepants
This is a totally average film with a few really good action scenes. The problem is that Jason Momoa and Amber Heard are terrible actors and the humour never works. Also, that scene with the pit bull song is the worst thing I have seen all year.
The best movie of the year
You know what? I went in expecting the worst. And it isn't the worst. I mean the script is fucking terrible, don't get me wrong, and some characters are paper thin. Plus the CGI can get a bit too much. But it was entertaining. Jason Mamoa looks like he's having a blast and is easily the best part of it. He's just funny and down to earth. Some of Wan's action scenes are incredibly fun even if reliant on CGI. It's a little too long I'll admit too, it could do with some cutting down, but it was entertaining enough compared to the other DC movies. So yeah, it was alright.
Well this movie was....F U N. Yeah, that’s pretty much how i would overall describe Aquaman, i mean, sure, its super cheesy, it has cringey moments that remind you of early 2000s superhero movies, the dialogue is exposition-heavy and sometimes non-sensical, BUT its also visually stunning, the score gives off cool Tron vibes, Momoa is charismatic as hell, Patrick Wilson is entertaining to watch as he chews the scenery and the action scenes are superbly directed. So yeah, I’d recommend Aquaman, i can’t see anyone not having a blast with this one.
Watched this with my brothers on a Thursday night, which I would regret the following day. The stills in the film are very desktop-wallpaper-worthy. The lines are so bad (e.g., Just call me the Ocean Master) and I feel like the plot, the script, everything would work better in 30-minute episodes of 2D animation.
Why was Black Manta even this lol
Worst thing I've seen in theaters since... Suicide Squad? Why the hell am I not surprised? Shazam will be your last chance with me, DCU.
Directing: 8.1/10 Acting: 8/10 Screenplay/Story: 6.5/10 Cinematography: 7.5/10 Production: 9/10
The action! THE ACTION!  Wooh! the action.
This film cost $350 million, yet it still looks like they got Amber Heard's wig from the bargain bin in Poundland.
Completely ridiculous. Just off the wall nuts. I'm still not really sure what I just watched. It's cheesey yet epic. The cut less fight scenes, the sprawling under water metropolis and practical effect suits are an absolute marvel(hehe) yet the dialogue is so shoddy. All the lore is there and the characters are created perfectly and I really don't think we could've had a more entertaining Aquaman film created by anybody else.
Nothing but high praise for James Wan and the rest of the team for having successfully introduced a formidable addition to the DCEU. Brilliant directing and creative vision that starkly contrasts the previous films in the franchise with Zack Snyder at the helm. I also loved the script, though I did think it could do much better - loved the execution of Chekhov's gun as a narrative device repeatedly throughout the film, plus cool foreshadowing and drawing of parallels as well. My only problem with the film is that it introduced an element of environmentalism on an alarming note but didn't tie up that particular end - I wish that Arthur being hailed as guardian and titular hero of the seven kingdoms could have been shown trying to remedy the grief that humanity has wreaked upon the oceans and seas. It's connected to Mera who slowly learns to acquaint herself with surface dwelling and beauty in the land - but no clear effort to return those sentiments about those who live underwater. Overall though, a solid effort. I hope the success of this film encourages Warner Bros. and DC executives to trust varying, diverse talent in taking charge of solidifying the worldbuilding of the DCEU - it's too glorious and extensive to be placed in the hands of one man alone.
I feel like the character's are still explaining the plot to me....
