The best I can say is at least it’s not Batman and robin
Chris O'Donnell as Robin helped me realize my sexuality and that should be enough to give this 5 stars. but it's not a good movie, which is a shame
So Batman Forever was Joel Schumacher’s first sorry attempt at a Batman movie. And man did he screw it up! This film took everything that made the 1989 Batman so great, and threw it out the freakin window! He did the same thing that Brett Ratner did with X Men the Last Stand. He replaced good drama and character arcs, with absurd gadgets and gizmos, and campy as heck villains. And when I mean campy, I mean 1966 campy. I mean you got Jim Carry playing the Riddler, what could you expect. This film is definitely not as bad as Batman and Robin. But is is still a far cry from what Batman was, and has become.
A big guilty pleasure of mine tbh 😂
Sit down kids, and let me take you back to that olde timey year, 1995...this was actually the #1 movie that year, the theater was packed when I saw it, and remember, this was before stadium seating, so you got all up in each other's armrests! I was disappointed Keaton left with Burton, but this was pretty fresh at the time. I still listen to my soundtrack CD, it's still great. Kilmer is so subdued, as both Bats and Bruce. Tommy Lee Jones almost explodes his own head attempting to out-ham Jim Carrey. Jones goes too far, Carrey is perfect. Kidman never disappoints, ever. After so many newer and darker versions since, it's only natural to look at this as cheesy, but it's one of the best Batman movies we've got.
The only good Batman movie
Hate to say it but any movie with him Carrey I have to watch. It's bad but he makes it work. It does help that Jones was having fun every day on set.
God this movie is dumb, but damnit it's fun and silly. Michael Keaton is sorely missed as is Tim Burton and the seriousness of the previous films. It's pretty obvious within the first 10 minutes Warner Brothers kicked Tim Burton and his script to the side. If this film doesn't completely offend you as a Batman fan, it's actually so dumb and silly and the performances are so over the top its enjoyable at times. Jim Carrey is basically playing the Mask again with riddles. I mean it's Jim Carrey in the 90s what more do expect. Val Kilmer is a terrible Batman with awful lines, but he's not a bad Bruce Wayne. I think with better writing and less mouth breathing on his part he could have been a decent Batman/Bruce Wayne combo. Chris O'Donnell is an over the top gooft Robin and fits in with this stupidly goofy movie. The fact they tryed to make this 25 year old at the time pass as a teenager is hilarious. Lastly on to the biggest dumbest overacted garbage performance in this entire film. Tommy Lee Jones as Two Face. Where the hell do I start, I feel like Jones watched the 89 Batman film and pretty much just based his entire performance on that movies Joker. To put it bluntly his is the worst and best thing in this movie. He and Carrey are so over the top that you can't help but laugh at the stupidity and that pretty much describes this film you can help but like the stupidity and thats why it was able to squeeze out a 1 and half star. If you see this movie cool if not your not missing much. If you do decide to watch this movie slam a few adult beverages before to increase your enjoyment. PS. O yeah Nicole Kidman is in this movie don't worry 2 days after you'll forget too.
BATMAN FOREVER (1995) "Batman must battle former district attorney Harvey Dent, who is now Two-Face and Edward Nygma, The Riddler with help from an amorous psychologist and a young circus acrobat who becomes his sidekick, Robin." I'm going to get this out of the way real quick so you understand fully where this review is going: I hate this sad excuse of a Batman flick! The third installment in the initial Batman film series finds the caped crusader, now played by Val Kilmer, battling Two-Face (portrayed by Tommy Lee Jones) and The Riddler (portrayed by Jim Carrey), with the aid of Robin (portrayed by Chris O'Donnell). Batman attempts to thwart the evil scheme concocted by The Riddler and Two-Face to extract all information from the minds of Gotham's residents for unlimited knowledge and control. Okay, time to rip these red flags to shreds: the acting by everyone involved is surprisingly bad (save for Nicole Kidman ironically), with some cringeworthy bits of dialogue being delivered at inappropriate times ("I'M BATMAN!"_Bruce Wayne during the circus incident). Val Kilmer is terribly cast, and I'm sorry, Jim Carrey was so over the top and whimsical, he would've been better suited playing The Joker. Speaking of The Riddler, who the Hell thought it a keen idea to make him resemble Gozer The Destructor from Ghostbusters (1984) in the anticlimactic ending?! Why does Two-Face look like half his face (the burned part that looks like chewed bubblegum) got dipped in Pepto Bismal?! Why is Robin a full grown adult?! What the fuck is with Batman's suit having rubber nipples and those ominous close-up ass shots from the cinematographer?! Ugh!!! The action sequences are trash, the humor stupid and unfunny, the set designs are now clunky and ugly looking, the musical score is second-rate, and the tone just bleh overall. The movie's plot is absolute garbage and the movie has severe dry patches of boringness. Joel Schumacher, what were you smoking, bro?! I will say this though! The movie has a couple of noteworthy positives worth mentioning. I liked the look of the Batmobile in this; it's flashy and fancy and fast! Nicole Kidman, as mentioned earlier, is the only good actress in this movie, even if her character lacks any development. A smidget of the effects are good to gawk at. And really...that's about it. Guys, I'm sorry, but this movie really sucks. It should've been retitled 'Batman Never.'
My first full viewing of this & I don’t give a shit about the nipples on the suits, I just think Jim Carrey fucking sucks.   Nice to see Nicole Kidman having fun as the psychiatrist that’s super horny for Batman.
Oh you minx, you saucy seductress Batman Forever. You movie that I alternately mildly enjoy and hate. You movie that should have been so much more, who’s parts are so much greater than its sum. You a terrific Batman/Bruce Wayne in Kilmer, a rockin’ Batmobile, Nicole Kidman as a dream doctor whomhas a thing for bats (get it?), Jim Carrey as a perfect goofball of a Fiddler, and flippin’ Tommy Lee Jones! What can you go wrong with all of this in place? So much. So, so much. You can bring in a seventy year old Robin (who apparently dries his clothes with karate and a mop). You can decide the best way to portray the epic hardness of the street gangs by painting all of their faces with neon glow in the dark face paint. You can strip Tommy Lee Jones of any dignity in his role and make him a thankless sidekick to Jim Carey’s brilliant Riddle. Instead of having them face off against one another upping each others game you push him into the background allowing him to get lost in the in the carnival playing out on screen. Let’s get one thing straight, Kilmer makes a great Batman. He is what elevates this movie above what would go on to become Batman and Robin. And while that rumored onset fight may have kept us from having a great Batman to populate what may have been a series of ever more embarrassing Batman films, it is also so very comforting to know that Batman punched (shoved) the guy destroying his on screen legacy all while in the Bat-suit (maybe?). I cannot decide how I feel about this particular movie, it is something I have struggled with for years. I want it to be so much better than it is. I see a better movie hiding underneath all ohm he trash piled on top of it, just bursting to get out. (Keaton was smart and did.) For years I clung to an answer to how this could be almost good, and it was a brief little credit over the bank vault at the beginning of the film Executive Producer: Tim Burton. I don’t know how much influence he actually had over the final film (he had prepped for a third before he was removed from the directors chair), but I still (must) believe that his voice was still, even if ever so faintly, heard. I have never seen a Schumacher film I liked, this is the closest I have ever come.
This is a lackluster Batman film that has barely any entertainment value. Val Kilmer has one of the least memorable Batman performances and Nicole Kidman is too good for this role, which is a statement I can make for the rest of the cast, while Tommy Lee Jones has one of the worst performances in the entirety of the Batman series.
BATMAN FOREVER (PG) D: Joel Schumacher Warner Bros. (Tim Burton & Peter Macgregor-Scott) 🇺🇸 1995 121 mins Action/Adventure/Fantasy W: Lee Batchler, Janet Scott Batchler & Akiva Goldsman [based on characters created by Bob Kane] DP: Stephen Goldblatt Ed: Dennis Virkler Mus: Elliott Goldenthal PD: Barbara Ling Val Kilmer (Bruce Wayne/Batman), Tommy Lee Jones (Harvey Dent/Two Face), Jim Carrey (Edward Nygma/The Riddler), Nicole Kidman (Dr. Chase Meridian), Chris O'Donnell (Dick Grayson/Robin), Michael Gough (Alfred), Pat Hingle (Commissioner Gordon) Some odious, money-minded studio executive clearly must have thought that the previous two Batman films were far too dark for children, so decided that there'd be all change and the result is something so camp that the 1960's TV show would blush in embarrassment. Joel Schumacher replaces Tim Burton as director, Val "It's the car right? Chicks love the car" Kilmer steps in as Batman and Gotham City is replaced by some kind of circus. Chris O'Donnell joins Batman's side as the incredibly obnoxious Robin as they battle criminals Two Face, poorly portrayed by Tommy Lee Jones, and The Riddler (Jim Carrey's madcap performance is probably the only good thing about this film). All the set pieces are pale imitations of those from the Tim Burton movies and the screenplay is simply pathetic! "Holy rusted metal, Batman!"? Bollocks!! 4/10
“Nice form little rough on the landing, he may have to settle for the bronze”  Jim Carrey and tommy lee jones sort of saved this movie. Without them there wouldn’t really be anything else to appreciate. Because besides them this film kind of sucks.
The Riddler has grown on me. He has cool stuff at his house.
It may be the first Batman film I saw in theatres, but the villains make the Adam West series look somber, and Bruce Wayne forgot the night his parents died? Holy rusted metal Batman!
if jim carrey could read my mind he would know how much i love him
You guys ready to hate me?  I’m about to GO IN and rate a ton of movies I’ve seen but not logged- and will potentially never watch again. If I have any thoughts on the film, I will put them here:  Sorry for the spam!
Controvercial opinion time: This is my favourite Batman film so far of my Batman Movie watch through. This has it all, it's got action, it's got a bit of comedy, it's got the darkness of Batman and the sarcasm, and it's even got Robin now too! It's great, I loved it! Also I didn't twig that Robin was played by Chris O'Donnell, he doesn't look anything like the older version I know from NCIS:LA. Instead I was watching thinking he Must have been related to Stephen Amell, like an older brother or a cousin or something. But no!
A solid goofy fun popcorn Batman movie that has a great cast , whenever i watch this movie it brings back nostalgic feelings , oh and it has one of my favorite movie title songs ever , kiss from a rose by Seal !
A guilty pleasure movie. So bad it’s good.
As bad as this movie is direction and storytelling wise... I really enjoy all of the villains-- the actors did a great job, and the costume and set design is a lot more colorful than you'd expect in a batman film and I love it
I couldn’t remember if I walked out of this movie before it finished back in 1995, but I know I hated this film. After recently reading an article on the making of it, I had forgotten how many awesome actors are in it. I decided to give it another look 23 years later. While I still hate it, it wasn’t as bad as I remember. However, Tommy Lee Jones was atrocious and the directing was some of the worst I’d seen, terrible camera moves, horrible ADR and don’t get me started on the second unit shots (Bat Bum anyone?!)
The only good thing about this movie was Jim Carrey’s portrayal of The Riddler.
Once again, I watched this a lot on VHS
I watched this movie (and the other three Batman films in this series) all for the first time earlier this year. In fact, I watched this and Batman & Robin one right after the other on the same night (when I discovered they were leaving Netflix at the end of that week). I said this in my & Robin review, but I went into these last two expecting irredeemable garbage, and what I actually got was at worst a middling superhero story with highly stylized production design and a few genuine laughs. I think I liked & Robin a little more than this because I liked its villains more - Jim Carrey in particular got on my nerves in this movie. I also wasn't as sold on Val Kilmer as Batman as I was George Clooney or Michael Keaton - he wasn't bad but he didn't seem to bring much of a personal touch to the role. I generally liked these movies, though, enough that I'd even watch them again at some point. I think they'd be fun to watch with a friend and poke fun at. I certainly don't think they're the abysmal insults to the art of cinema that RottenTomatoes and IMDB seem to think they are. I guess people take their portrayals of Batman pretty personally, but for all the Long Halloween and Year One comics in his storyline, there are also a lot of goofy silver age ones too. It's not as if the Adam West-led TV show wasn't true to the books in its own way. I think the success of the Nolan films shows us, though, that that wasn't the Batman people were looking to see in the movies, though. Oh well. I wouldn't mind some levity in the DC cinematic universe these days.
If I'm being honest with everyone here *gestures openly to a large room, holding only my mother, two dogs and a sleeping cat* this is my favorite Batman movie. You could say it's my power, my pleasure, my pain.
It’s one of those movies were it’s so bad that it’s good
Not that bad of a movie at all. More or less enjoyed it.
(Old impressions, not based on a recent viewing) At times surprisingly compelling, but the mismatch of drama and ridiculousness makes this a watchable mess with an odd appeal to it.
COURAGE NOW, TRUTH ALWAYS… I was surprised how much I like Jim carry as the Riddler, quite a unique take on the character. I love how they played out the ending with Enigma, such a perfect way to play out him giving away the identity of the Batman. Found it kind of silly how Chase went from wanting The Batman originally, then turning to Bruce instead, seemed a bit unnecessary. I also love the Robin in this, he suited the role really well.
I like them both
Yes, I know this is also a rather unorthodox choice for a Halloween marathon, but screw it, it has a scene that takes place during Halloween, so I say it counts. Besides, it makes perfect sense to revisit Nicole Kidman’s first foray into the DC Universe with Aquaman coming out later this year, doesn’t it? So here we are at last – Batman Forever. The one Batman movie that I had never seen in its entirety until now. And I’m not gonna beat around the bush, guys – out of all the live action Batman movies this is by far my least favorite. You can argue all you want that Batman & Robin is worse, but at least that movie had a more consistent tone, it committed to its campy batshit insanity and at least there was more of an awareness of what they were doing and the type of movie they were making. Joel Schumacher once said that everybody involved with Batman Forever was very reluctant to work on it and let me tell you, the behind-the-scenes problems are very evident in the final product. This is the most tonally confused DC movie I’ve seen pre-Justice League. Warner Bros. wanted to lighten things up and take the series in a more family friendly direction after Batman Returns, but the film still has some pretty dark and serious moments and it’s clear that Schumacher had a very hard time balancing those completely opposite elements, leading to some pretty jarring tonal shifts. Don’t misunderstand me – the scenes between Alfred and Bruce in Batman & Robin (AKA the best parts of it) also clashed with the overall campy and silly tone of the movie, but in hindsight, even they weren’t this jarring. Oh, and you just gotta love how the studio was constantly going on and on and on about how they were taking things in a more family friendly direction, yet they still allowed the early dialogue exchanges between Chase Meridian and Batman, a close-up of Batman’s ass and a Nicole Kidman panty shot. I’d really like to know how Schumacher blackmailed WB to let him keep the latter two in the final cut. And trust me, the uneven tone of this movie is the least of its problems, but before I move on, I’ll just like to take this moment to say that Batman Forever’s title sequence is hands down the worst in the franchise – the cast’s names flying out at us against a boring-ass black backdrop via effects that even Power Point presentations would laugh at. How fucking inspired. Say what you will about the other Batman movies, but they knew how to introduce their titles. The first Burton movie had the camera circling through a huge Batman logo. Batman Returns showed us the origin of the Penguin as the credits were rolling. And in both cases we had Danny Elfman’s epic Batman theme blaring in the background, perfectly complementing the visuals. Even Batman & Robin got this right! www.youtube.com/watch?v=xP4WLAeOpyM And now that I’ve made my point, let’s continue. The movie’s chaotic production is also reflected in its storytelling, which is really poor in some areas, more particularly with regard to some of the characters, especially Two-Face. Harvey Dent is one of the most tragic Batman villains of all time, so much so that his fall from grace and his transformation into Two-Face was a major central storyline in The Dark Knight and the brilliant way it was handled is one of the many reasons why that movie is held in such high regard. Sadly, Batman Forever not only glosses over this tragedy which can fill an entire movie on its own (or at the very least be an intricate part of a much larger storyline), reducing it to really clumsy exposition dumps, but it turns Two-Face into a complete joke. I am not exaggerating in the slightest when I say that he literally has no reason whatsoever to hate Batman in this movie. Batman wasn’t the one who threw acid in his face – it was a mob boss! Why doesn’t he hate and try to kill that mob boss?! Especially since that’s exactly what he did in the Batman: The Animated Series two-parter “Two-Face”. Why? Because the writers of that show can actually think logically. The only reason he fought Batman in those two episodes was because Batman kept getting in his way. Aside from that, his attention was focused entirely on the man who ruined his life. They also try to give Batman and Two-Face a connection in this movie and they fail miserably at it – towards the end Batman tells Two-Face that he was a good friend and it really doesn’t work because those two had zero connection in the previous two movies. Some people have actually tried to defend this, stating that Forever is actually a soft reboot, but this argument holds no weight because there are very overt references to the previous two movies and Pat Hingle and Michael Gough are still playing Commissioner Gordon and Alfred. But even taking that out of the equation, the connection between Batman and Two-Face that they so desperately try to push doesn’t work because we never saw them as friends. Compare that to Star Wars: A New Hope. In that film, Obi-Wan and Vader have only one scene together, but because of Obi-Wan’s earlier recounting of his tragic past experiences with Vader, you could feel the history and the connection between them, which is why their encounter is such an effective moment. On top of his total lack of motivation, Two-Face cannot even be considered a character because he is not a character – he’s a plot device. The only reason why he’s in this movie is to pave the way for a connection and a relationship that actually works, but we’ll get to that later. The rest of the time he’s mugging obnoxiously for the camera. Which brings me to the final reason this version of Two-Face doesn’t work – Tommy Lee Jones’ terrible performance. Jones is a great actor and he’s certainly had successful forays into the comic book movie genre (Men in Black, Captain America: The First Avenger), but here he is just embarrassing himself – so much so that I can’t even say I feel sorry for him. This guy actually had the balls to criticize Jim Carrey’s performance and call him a buffoon. Motherfucker, did you ever stop to consider how YOU looked from the sidelines while making this movie? Unlike you, Carrey was actually entertaining and his Riddler actually had a personality, but again, let’s not get ahead of ourselves. And that piece of shit makeup you’re wearing is certainly not helping your case. I love Rick Baker, but he must have been high as a kite when he created that makeup. Can’t say I blame him. Guys, say what you will about Arnold Schwarzenegger’s Mr. Freeze, but at least he was a fleshed out character with fleshed out and understandable motives and he actually went through an arc. OK, I’m done talking about Two-Face, let’s move on because we still have a lot of ground to cover. Next up, we have another very problematic character – Dr. Chase Meridian, played by Nicole Kidman. This has got to be the worst psychiatrist I’ve ever seen in a movie because throughout a good chunk of her screentime all she does is talk about how she wants to bang Batman. Also, what psychiatrist does boxing before sessions with her patients? And to top it all off, I just don’t feel any chemistry between her and Val Kilmer, which makes the moment when Bruce decides to quit being Batman so he can be with her that much more unbelievable. Are you kidding me? This horny chick with a major Bat-boner is the reason why Bruce decides to quit being Batman?! Not the death of the Graysons. Not the fact that he failed to save Harvey Dent from becoming Two-Face. Not some crippling injury. They do try to give an explanation, but it comes across as incredibly half-assed. The sad thing is, this character actually could’ve worked if they had made her a villain and called her Harleen Quinzel. Think about it – Chase Meridian is a psychiatrist who is obsessed with one of Gotham’s most famous loonies (because, come on, what sane person would fight crime dressed up as a giant bat?) and wants to write a book on said loony and even become romantically involved with him. That’s literally note for note Harley Quinn’s character and if they had gotten rid of Two-Face, renamed her to Harleen Quinzel and focused on her obsession with Batman leading her to become Harley Quinn, modeling herself after the Joker, we could’ve had something there. I mean, she’s gotta know about the Joker and the other villains Batman has fought (“Do I need skin-tight vinyl and a whip?”), but I digress. But by far the character who really got the shaft in this movie is Commissioner Gordon. Now, I can’t pretend this is something exclusive to this movie because he was also pretty ineffectual in the Burton films, but here they really cranked up his useless levels to 11, as he just lets Batman do his job for him almost all the time. It just feels like a waste of Pat Hingle’s talents and it makes me all the more thankful for the much better way that Christopher Nolan and Gary Oldman portrayed Gordon. And at this point you’re probably wondering if there’s even anything I liked about this movie. Well, yes – quite a few things, actually. For all its problems (and believe me, there are many more), the movie does have its fair share of redeeming qualities. First and foremost, The Riddler. What can I say – Jim Carrey is always a plus and he is as entertaining and funny as he’s ever been and the manic energy he brings to the character really helps elevate this movie. Edward Nygma is pretty much the type of obsessive fan that Stephen King wrote about in Misery. Carrey perfectly rides the line between funny and psychotic and you understand why Nygma hates Bruce Wayne. Not to mention that his plan – using mass media as a way to steal people’s knowledge and secrets – is brilliant and has become even more relevant as a commentary in this day and age. Next up, we have the second best character in the movie – Dick Grayson aka Robin. While Chris O’Donnell does look way too old to be a teenager, he still does a pretty good job in the role, making you feel the pain that Robin is going through after losing his entire family, leading to some really well done interactions and conversations between him and Bruce. They can actually relate to each other because they lost their parents in a very similar fashion. I also have to give costume designers Ingrid Ferrin and Bob Ringwood credit because the Robin costume actually looks pretty damn good. The only issue I have with Robin is the way he was captured by Two-Face, which I don’t buy for a second. I mean, seriously, he couldn’t have just knocked the gun out of Two-Face’s hand? Jeez, Robin, sometimes you really are a D-I-C-K. Despite my issues with Chase, Nicole Kidman does fine with the material she’s given. Val Kilmer is… OK as Batman, I guess, derpy Bat-smile notwithstanding. Nothing great, but nothing terrible. Like I said, his best scenes in this movie are with Dick and, to his credit, Val Kilmer does an admirable job portraying Bruce’s guilt for failing to save the Graysons as well as his psychological torment and PTSD. The extremely atmospheric way that Schumacher and DOP Stephen Goldblatt shot the death of the Waynes and Batman’s origin, is nothing short of breathtaking, especially that shot of the bat flying towards little Bruce. And last, but definitely not least, Michael Gough knocks it out of the park as Alfred once again. Production designer Barbara Ling also managed to craft some pretty impressive sets, especially Two-Face’s lair and Arkham Asylum, which looks really cool. It’s really sad when the lair of a villain has more character and personality than its master, but what can you do. Lastly, while I certainly understand why it’s not everybody’s cup of tea, I personally really enjoyed Elliot Goldenthal’s score. In conclusion, despite a few bright spots and a couple of well-adapted moments from the comics, Batman Forever is overall a mess, suffering from poorly developed characters, inconsistencies with the previous two movies, an uneven tone and some pretty cringe-worthy dialogue and moments. I know a lot of people really like it because it was their first introduction to Batman – and if that’s the case, more power to you, go ahead and enjoy it, there’s certainly a lot to like about it – but, as controversial as this may sound, in my opinion Batman & Robin is better. It’s not a good movie by any means, but it had more of an identity, it was more self-aware and at least it went all the way with its campy schlock. If Batman Forever is on TV, I might watch it, but I’d rather have a DVD/Blu-Ray player remote so I can fast-forward to the good moments. On the bright side, at least now we know why Ace Ventura hates bats. Next time, on the Halloween marathon, we go from DC to Marvel because it’s open season on all suckheads. Stay tuned.
The film that’s responsible for me being a Batman fan. No, it’s not a great film by any means but the 5 year old version of myself loved every moment of this movie. The adult version of myself can tolerate it. Personally I don’t believe it’s as bad as most people make it out to be.
Gotham is terrorized by unrelated psycho dweebs who call themselves Joker, Riddler, Two-Face, Penguin and Mister Freeze. Have you ever thought of moving, Bruce?
Underwhelming take on the caped crusader. Good scenery and energy, mediocre screenplay. 5/10
I think I'm the only person in the world to hate this more than Batman and Robin. Blame Jim Carrey.
Movie 2 of the worst batman series. Val Kimer is not my favorite batman but is better than Clooney, Jim Carey and Tommy Lee Jones are OK in this movie, neither are my favorite rendition of the character, but a close second. Batman forever is when they tried to appease the children and pushed to make money from action figures. That's why this movie is more of a cartoon and the characters seem more one dimensional.
Very different feel to it than the Tim Burton films. Characters and visuals much more extreme and supposed to be comical. Tommy Lee Jones and Jim Carrey both didn’t convince me as villains.
yeah, it's bad. yeah, riddler's bodysuit was so tight i was physically uncomfortable. yeah, there's a sexual innuendo every two seconds. but i'd be lying if i said i didn't have almost as good of a time as jim carrey obviously had filming it,,,, and this has some of the most interesting set/costumes design i've EVER seen (also nicole kidman... nghh 💕💕)
Batman Forever: Red Book Edition
Why is this so much more memorable and enjoyable than the hero flicks of the last decade or so? I think the Riddler lays it out pretty well in a quip to his partner in crime. "Your entrance was good, his was better. The difference? Showmanship."
The thing that annoys me the most about this movie now, is when Edward drives up to Wayne Manor, before transforming into The Riddler, and just places a big green envelope on the gates. So apparently Wayne Manor has no fucking security system set up to watch the perimeters? Batman doesn’t think he should guard his house? They would’ve filmed him coming up and solved this so quickly.  I blame Akiva Goldsman.
This movie gets a really bad wrap because it's directed by Joel Schumacher, who also made the awful Batman and Robin. But Batman Forever is actually pretty good. It has some of the campiness and cheesiness inspired by the 60s Batman show, but there are still enough serious moments and Tim Burton influence to make this movie enjoyable. The lighthearted elements mix with the darker moments really well. Tommy Lee Jones makes a pretty good two-face, Jim Carey is awesome as the Riddler, Val Kilmer is an underrated Batman and Nicole Kidman is great. It's also a great looking movie. The set and costume design blend the Gothic Burtonesque motifs with a brighter and more whimsical colour pallet to create some weird and unique scenery. Batman Forever is just fabulous.
Loud, garish and overacted, it's definitely a downgrade from the Tim Burton movies.
Surely no one can even argue against Riddler and Two Face being obvious gay lovers in this.
Wonder if we'll reach this level of wackiness in movies ever again
Robin: You don’t know what it’s like to have both of your parents murdered right in front of you  Batman: Yeah I do.
(This movie was watched as part of Super-Cember, in which I watched a different superhero movie I'd never seen before in the month of December 2017) You guys already know that Batman Returns is my favourite movie of the month so far. That's why, when I saw Batman Forever (1995) today, you can imagine I was severely disappointed. This is just not a good movie, though I can't exactly say it's a bad one either. Starring Val Kilmer as Bruce Wayne/Batman, Tommy Lee Jones as Harvey Dent/Two-Face, Jim Carrey as Edward Nygma/The Riddler, Nicole Kidman as Dr. Chase Meridian and Chris O'Donnell as Dick Grayson/Robin. Right from the first two lines, this movie felt off. It was clear this was targeted more at kids, and the tone is nowhere near as dark as Batman Returns. Despite this, the movie tries to continue the story of Bruce attempting to remember about his parents' death, and there a lot of great atmospheric scenes that really don't fit the overall tone of the movie. It's almost like the first draft was a darker movie like the previous, but then through either the studio's intervention or just lazy rewrites, we got the lighter tone. It's a messy movie in that sense, and I couldn't really take it seriously. Even the sets look ridiculous. I have no idea when Gotham decided to build statues taller than the buildings themselves, but they should stop that. Val Kilmer replaces Michael Keaton from the previous movies and he does his best. It doesn't really help that Bruce Wayne and Batman are barely given anything to do, and Kilmer definitely isn't as good in the role as Keaton was. Chris O'Donnell debuts as Dick Grayson, and I like aspects of his performance. When his characters not make stupid-ass decisions like taking the Batmobile out for a spin, I really liked his character. They did a great job of establishing his origins, and he has a very believable struggle with Bruce throughout the film. Nicole Kidman has been the least impressive of the love interests. She tries her best in her performance, but the character is beyond boring. We're introduced to her as being in love with Batman just because she is, and then once she finally gets Batman, she turns him down for Bruce just because she does. There's no clear motivations for why she does the things she does, and we don't even get the benefit of any Pfeiffer-esque freakouts to entertain us in the meantime. You can tell she's bored in this movie, and it's such a waste of Nicole Kidman. The only really fun and entertaining things about this movie are its villains. Don't get me wrong, they don't come close to Nicholson, Walken, Pfeiffer or Devito, but you can tell these two are really having fun here, and they lavish in every second of screen-time they get. Tommy Lee Jones plays Two-Face, which is a weird cast change after getting Billy Dee Williams for the first movie. His performance is fine, but we really would have benefited from seeing who Harvey Dent was before the accident that made him insane. Something as simple as that would have really gone a long way here. Also, his makeup is very noticeable, and it doesn't really look like acid burns at all. Just another thing that took me out of the experience. But the gold medal here goes to Jim Carrey as the Riddler. True, he's really just playing Jim Carrey in this movie, but it's so very entertaining. Every time he's on screen, he steals the show, and you can tell he's really enjoying himself in this film. Yes, his motivations are extremely flimsy, and his turn to villain was one of the most sudden and forced things I've ever seen in a comic-book movie, and as far as evil schemes go, this is tame in comparison to the villains of the previous films, but I'm sorry, Carrey is just so fun to watch. It's like he knew how much of a joke the character was, so he made his whole performance into the joke, and it just works. If Jim Carrey was going to play any comic-book character, I'm glad it was the Riddler. Overall, Batman Forever (1995), was a boring movie that was thankfully redeemed somewhat by Jim Carrey. Such a drop in quality from the previous film, and I already know what a joke the next Batman film is, so I'm certainly not looking forward to watching that one in 6 days.
"Was that over the top? I can never tell."
The riddler was cool but nothing else was
This movie gets credit for some reason. I think just because it's good compared to Batman & Robin. But it's not good. It's bad. And I hate Tommy Lee Jones in it.
This is the first time seeing this, and I just didn’t enjoy it. I love Burton’s take on the Bat, but Shumacher’s is much less my style. Everything felt fake, including the set. In Burton’s, everything is overstylized, but it still feels gritty and lived in, whereas here everything feels sanitized and just plain boring. I surprisingly liked Jim Carey in this, and Nicole Kidman, but otherwise I wasn’t a big fan of the cast. This is my least favorite Batman so far, and I really didn’t like the introduction of Robin.
Nicole Kidman.
It's so long. Outside of the production design, this is a tough one. Jim Carry has some nice campy moments as Riddler but when it veers into the Jim Carrey persona it's too much. Poor Tommy Lee Jones. He's pretty good here but I feel gets overshadowed by Carrey. This movie is bad because the Chase/dream meaning subplot doesn't amount to anything. Character decisions are arbitrary and based entirely what the plot needs; go ahead and try to explain why and how the Bruce/Dick conflict gets resolved. The shot choices are really showy to help camp this thing up but it can be too much at times and just look really ugly. Young Chris o'Donnell though. Damn. I'm still into it, earring and all.
It doesn’t get any of the characters right and it honestly makes next to no sense but there isn’t a minute of it where you aren’t entertained by how utterly baffling it all is.
"Batman Forever" marks the start of the "dark days" of Batman, but there is still a lot of fun to be had. Kilmer is solid as the new Bruce Wayne, and Lee Jones & Carry are bonkers as Two-Face & Riddler. The absolute WORST aspect of the film is Robin.
You know, now that the conventional wisdom has come around to admitting that Batman ‘66 is great, it’s time for a reappraisal of the Schumacher bat-films. While they’re not necessarily good, they’re a visual riot that are certainly never boring and are, indeed, endlessly fascinating.
this has the most phallic looking batmobile
Not particularly good, mainly due to sudden shifts in tone. At times it feels like it inherited parts from the earlier Burton films (unfortunately not the aesthetics though) while also introducing a lot a camp which makes it jarring. Add to this a weak, messy plot and some stupid dialog and you get a pretty weak film.
Batman Forever is… not good. To quote Honest Trailers, “this is the worst movie I’ve ever seen more than 10 times.” The acting is mostly good, but EXTREMELY over-the-top, especially Jim Carrey as The Riddler, and Tommy Lee Jones as Two-Face is just… bizarre! Keaton was recast by Val Kilmer, and honestly his version of Batman is the most forgettable of them all. He isn’t the worst, but he isn’t that good. There are two things I genuinely love about this movie: 1. Chris O’Donnell’s Robin arc where he wants revenge against Two-Face for murdering his family. It’s done pretty well, and is very emotionally investing and even makes Robin look classy and actually fairly developed in comparison to the rests of the movie. The second is Riddler’s plan to use TV to steal people’s personal information, like bank records and test scores. That is so ahead of it’s time! It made no sense back then, but after the internet was fully developed much later, this plan makes a lot more sense. Otherwise, this film, though not horrible, tries too little, and just comes across as half-assed. RATING: 4/10
Deeply flawed, incredibly silly, and far too over the top for its own good...but I can’t help loving the hell out of the sleazy neon production design, Elliot Goldenthal’s brassy score, and the overall wacko rock opera-ness of Batman Forever. So sue me, I love it.
Biggest gripe- the riddler and two-face both act crazy and goofy.... like the joker. They are the same character... Just a bad batman film. There are redeeming qualities of the film- although i cant think of any. I suppose its still fun to watch and have a good time even though as a film its trash.
Can I persuade you to take a sandwich with you, sir?  I'll get drive-thru. Batman Forever was just as bad as I remembered. It’s a giant disappointment after the greatness of Burton’s Batman and Batman Returns. Schumacher brought the same OTT silliness of The Lost Boys but this time it isn’t fun.  Val Kilmer is the most attractive and perhaps least interesting Bruce Wayne/Batman (haven’t seen Affleck’s Batman so his could actually be the most boring version). He was kind of flat but dude could rock those glasses.  Poor Nicole Kidman did her best but wasn’t given a lot to work with as Dr Chase Meridian, who’s main character trait was a Batman fetish.  Ugh, the villains turned it up to 11 but not in a good way. You expect that level of irritatingly over the top madness from 90’s Jim Carrey but what was Tommy Lee Jones doing?  Chris O’Donnell was ok as orphaned acrobat Dick Grayson/Robin, his interactions with Alfred were probably the only things that stopped him from just being an annoying scamp and made him semi likeable.  The one bright spot was Michael Gough as the best Alfred, who luckily survived the Burton to Schumacher transition (such a shame Michael Keaton didn’t).  For some ridiculous reason I’m actually going to watch Batman & Robin...why am I doing this to myself?
We had to leave the theater because a friend's car alarm was going off in my parent's driveway. He got paged #911. Didn't bother me at all.
I’ve had toothache that was more fun than this
More like Batman Three-ever. Learn how to count, Schumacher.
imagine thinking this is bad.
I have a lot of nostalgia for Batman Forever. As a kid I loved Jim Carey and Batman, so seeing them together was a dream come true. It's also worth mentioning that I was a pretty dumb kid. This movie isn't good by any means, the script is bad, Tommy Lee Jones' performance as Two-Face is terrible, and it tries to be a semi-sequel to Burton's Batman movies, but it's too campy to be even slightly related. However, there's a lot of fun to be had with it. It's silly and over the top, but some of the performances are great (Jim Carey is the least Riddler-like Riddler possible, but it works so well in this universe, and I actually like Val Kilmer as Batman quite a bit) and the silliness works to the movie's favour. Overall, it's very enjoyable, if a little too much.
You ever dance with the devil in the neon-soaked PG-13 S&M nightmare?
Kilmer isn't good as Batman, and Robin is terrible.
After watching Batman & Robin, you can tell that Schumacher was a bit restrained by Burton's previous two movies while making this one. It jumps back and forth from Burton's to Schumacher's style quite often, making it very disjointed in tone. Kilmer's a decent Batman/Bruce Wayne in a similar style as Keaton. Nicole Kidman's character is so shoehorned in and unnecessary. Really sucks out the fun and slows down the pace. I used to love this one as a kid but now I find both villains grating. I'll take Arnold's Mister Freeze over these two any day.
Sure, whatever.
If Batman Returns was “too dark” then Batman forever takes it in the complete opposite direction. Director Joel Schumacher was hired to lighten the series up and make it both more family friendly and merchandise friendly.  The story follows Batman who goes up against two criminals, Two-Face and the Riddler. Meanwhile Bruce takes in a young Dick Grayson who’s family was tragically murdered.  Val Kilmer takes over the role of Batman from Michael Keaton and he’s... ok. He’s certainly not a bad actor but I also feel he’s not quite the right fit for this role even if, for the most part, he delivers what he needs to. Tommy Lee Jones finally gets a chance to overact and have a little fun, but the performance is also weirdly 2 dimensional, Jones hams it up rather then creating a well rounded opponent to Batman. Jim Carrey plays the riddler and does what he does in every other film, plays up his elastic face and various voices, plays this character at such a high level the entire film that never once does he feel like a real human being. I’d even say it borders on exhausting. Nicole Kidman plays Dr. Chase and she is given some of the worst dialogue I can think of (“Let’s just say I could write a hell of a paper on a grown man who dresses like a flying rodent”). Kidman’s not particularly good here but it’s more a fault of the writing, her character feels very underdeveloped, she’s there to provide Bruce/Batman with a love interest and someone he can talk to about his parents murder and that’s really it. Chris O’Donnell on the other hand gets the film’s strongest character arc as Dick, he’s quite good although how did he learn to drive a bat boat/submarine?  The film is filled with bright colours, Gotham City looks like a computer game, characters are like cartoons and it’s all very in your face, one might even say a bit much. I think Director Joel Schumacher was trying to find a balance between the camp of the 60’s series and the dark tone of Burton’s films and neither quite work, they don’t gel together, but the film is enjoyable regardless. Batman forever isn’t the best Batman film, but it’s certainly not the worst.
As a Batman film, it’s no-where near as good as Batman Returns, but it’s a pretty fun mid-90’s action film. It’s jarring to see big Tommy Lee Jones ham it up and Jim Carrey is bordering on parody by this point, but the designs for both characters work well, although imagine if they’d kept Billy Dee. The CG reminds me of a PC game that I played as a wee boy. Maybe Myst?  The relationship between Nicole Kidman and Val Kilmer is a bit weird though. They meet, Batman calls her work naive and she immediately tries to shag him. Definitely more of an afterthought than in the previous films.
It's been years since I've seen this, and now I know why. Pretty much unwatchable.
“Your entrance was good... his was better.”  Batman Forever can best be described as a Dick Sprang era inspired hallucinogenic trip of Dutch angles, spotlights, neon colors, over-acting, and pseudo-dystopian set design. Burton’s dark and twisted Batman and Batman Returns feels like a totally different film franchise when compared to Schumacher’s Batman Forever and Batman & Robin. Batman Forever is an exercise in excess, a case study of consumption, a microcosm of madness if you will (I’ll stop). My problem with this film is not that it’s over-the-top and cartoonish, but that things get out of hand far too quickly. Allow me to elaborate... Joel Schumacher is a solid director, but someone I feel was not the right choice to direct cartoonish and over-the-top Batman movies. That job was suited for one man and one man only. A man known for his unique style of comedy and directing. A man so willing to direct a superhero film, he went ahead and created his own character since he couldn’t secure the rights to an official one. That man is none other than Sam Raimi. Yes that’s right, Batman Forever is yet another movie I think should have been directed by Raimi. But I wasn’t the only person who thought so, Raimi came very close to directing the movie, but was rejected since Schumacher was the more “accomplished” director at the time. Raimi would have brought the balance Batman Forever is desperately lacking. Just think of his zany directing style mixed with that set design. We could have had Bruce Campbell as Two-Face for crying out loud! Unfortunately, in this timeline we have the Schumacher edition. But it’s not all bad news, far from it. Batman Forever works surprisingly well, and feels relatively fresh and inventive all these years later. I guess its a refreshing change from the doom-and-gloom editions of the Caped Crusader we’ve gotten more recently. And if you know anything about my cinematic tastes, you’ll know I’m a complete sucker for live-action cartoons. I mean the Kevin Conroy animated series is less of a cartoon than Batman Forever, and that’s literally a cartoon. I respect the direction Schumacher took Batman, and the aesthetic he went for was near perfect I think. I have a big problem with his use of comedy though. As that was an area that he went way too overboard with. Of course you can’t talk about Batman Forever without talking about the man behind the mask. Or maybe you can. Val Kilmer seems to be the least-talked about Bruce Wayne/Batman out of all the actors who’ve portrayed him. To be fair he doesn’t do a bad job, in fact I like his portrayal quite a bit. I think the fact that he was only Batman once and that the one movie he was Batman in was universally received as “eh” from critics and audiences cemented Kilmer’s place as irrelevant in the eyes of many.  "Let's start this party with a BANG!"  Someone who I think was either miscast or misdirected was Tommy Lee Jones as Two-Face. Although I find his portrayal to be entertaining, it’s a little too similar to the Joker. Jones comes off as just another overly crazed villain rather than a conflicted one. For a more accurate portrayal of Harvey Dent see Christopher Nolan’s quaint fan film The Dark Knight, not a lot of folks have checked that one out. Jim Carrey plays Jim Carrey as Jim Carrey where he acts a lot like Jim Carrey most of the movie. His take on The Riddler is honestly not bad, although he does get a little overbearing at times (see where this review is going yet?), but I suppose that is to be expected from him. I like Jim Carrey for the most part so his performance here isn’t anything out of the ordinary, especially from his mid-90s heyday (The Mask comes to mind). I swear Nicole Kidman was hornier in Batman Forever than she was in that movie where she dreamt of having an affair with a naval officer. Ho-ly Jesus she was a sight to behold in this movie; it felt like in every other scene she was ready to undress for Batman. Her character is an interesting concept rather than actually being interesting, if that makes any sense. Having her be a psychologist was an neat angle, but it doesn’t really go anywhere of value. As a result, her character gets lost in the sea of craziness that is Batman Forever. Robin as a general concept was a mistake, both in the comics and in the television/film adaptations. I’ve always found the idea of Batman having a sidekick to be so stupid. Robin’s inclusion in Batman Forever, is perhaps the film’s ultimate error. Everything involving his character was so pointless and so out of place. Chris O’Donnell does a fine enough job with the material he’s given, but I think we’re supposed to believe he’s like under the age of 21. I say this because he looks like he’s in his mid-20s in the movie, but he still has to be taken in for adoption? I guess in the Batman universe a legal adult is 30. The bulk of the film’s problems lie on the shoulders of Robin, which says a lot about his inclusion in the already populated screenplay.  For a good chunk of my childhood and my early teenage years, Batman Forever was either my second-favorite Batman film, or was in my top five. There an undeniable nostalgic connection I have with Batman Forever, but I don’t think it had much to do with how I felt about it during this watch. I think this movie gets lumped in with the comedic disaster that was Batman & Robin. So a lot of folks just assume it’s as bad or only slightly better. For what it is, Batman Forever is a solid Batman movie that may come as a breath of fresh air for those of you who hate the latest incarnation of the character. Here’s something else I’ll go ahead and say: Batman Forever is better than the vast majority of MCU movies. It’s certainly leagues ahead of anything the DCEU has put out.  Batman Forever is an imaginative, yet imbalanced Batman movie fueled by sheer insanity and goofiness. Because of that, I’ll always like this movie much more than most.
Seen on a normal television via VHS and normal broadcast sometime in the early 2000s. Liked it at the time, and looking back I continue to appreciate its weirdness and schlock.
This film is my ultimate guilty pleasure, I don't even care anymore, I love Batman forever. I'm not sure why or even how I just do.
Jim Carrey plays.... Peak Jim Carrey, so over the top stupid. Some of the costumes are pretty cool, but the movie is bad and funny, the batman butt shot and the grin he pulls when he gets rejected is great
This felt like watching two different films simultaneously, on one hand, there is this silly over the top wacky story of supervillains trying to create mayhem in a ridiculous looking Gotham, on the other, there is the story of a traumatized vigilante who finds love and meaning with fantastic camera work and overdone CGI. The decision to make this family-friendly by the studio was a big mistake and the deleted scenes prove that. There were a lot of minor continuity errors due to deleting scenes which could have given a whole new perspective to the narrative. Anyway, young Nicole Kidman is unbelievably hot.
These comedy Batman movies are great!
Within five minutes of watching Batman Forever, it's clear that the studio has gone through every effort to make Batman as kid-friendly as possible. First, they hired director Joel Schumacher to populate every frame with as much colourful neon light as possible. For the script they dumbed down the dialogue to nothing but one-liners and easy to follow exposition. The story is beyond ridiculous, emulating the 60s TV show Batman in the worst way. As villains, Jim Carrey and Tommy Lee Jones are as over the top as they possibly can be. The result is a film that has all the problems of Batman Returns but without the style or vision behind it. It's loud, incoherent, and more tedious than fun. And yet, I don't hate it. Nor do I love it. I'm just indifferent to it.
So I guess the one positive is… the relative absence of Bat-nipples?
I’m not sure how the superhero genre survived the 90s Batman films.
Even as a kid I'd watch this and be a bit repulsed. Val Kilmer not a bad Brucie at all though! (this could be Jim Carrey's worst performance)
Really not a very good film but I still enjoyed it cause HE’S BATMAN
Totally bonkers.
[upon reaching Claw Island]    Robin: Holey rusted metal, Batman!    Batman: Huh?    Robin: The ground, it's all metal. It's full of holes. You know, holey.    Batman: Oh.
I loved the colors and creative camerawork on display here, and more often than not the campy style worked for me, definitely much more than Schumacher's infamous Batman & Robin. This also kind of exhausted me at times, especially when the villains are onscreen. Tommy Lee Jones doesn't really bring a lot of definition or specific personality to the role of Two-Face; he's just loud. As for Jim Carrey... I made the mistake of finding out that Robin Williams was initially offered the role of the Riddler instead, and that was all I could think about for the rest of the movie. Histrionic villains aside, this entertained me pretty immensely. Schumacher is always kind of A Lot as a director, but here he pairs that extravagance with a comic-book aesthetic, and that combination pays off.
This movie spawned "Kiss From A Rose" does anything elae need to be said?
Why did I watch this movie. Why did I subject myself to this. This movie takes away everything that was good about the Burton films and throws them away. Burton’s stylistically creepy direction is replaced by Schumacher’s zany toy commercial and Gotham’s gothic aesthetic becomes a bright neon colorful headache. Val Kilmer is...ok as Bruce Wayne...I guess, but man, I can’t stand Chris O’Donnal as Robin. Aside from aging him up too much, this version of Robin has the same problem as Mr. “Fuck Batman” from Titans. Dick Grayson is one of the most likable characters in the entire DC and here he’s a whiny motorcycle brat. I can’t even put into words why this movie sucks so much. The only redeemable aspect of it is that I could be fun to watch with friends and make fun of. Even the music sucks. Fuck this movie!
And things begin to go astray. Needed more Burton and less Shumacher. Plot: Batman must battle former district attorney Harvey Dent, who is now Two-Face and Edward Nygma, The Riddler with help from an amorous psychologist and a young circus acrobat who becomes his sidekick, Robin.
It's been a long time since I've seen Tim Burton's batman movies, but surely they were never nearly this ridiculous right? Anyway, I"m kind of dreading watching Batman and Robin
Pretty good Batman Forever
One of my favorites as a kid. Not the case these days. Still enjoyable though.
bruce is soo awkward in this movie and i love it
Good thing Batman brought all those coins
You know...my problem isn't that it's all light hearted and goofy, it's that it does that while still taking alot from Tim Burton's version. Makes sense I guess since it's supposed to be the same continuity. Hell after seeing a few more of Joel Schumacher's films now, it almost seems like he was borrowing a bit of Burton's style. As a result the ridiculous fights and setpieces are undercut by the main story and vice versa. It tries to tell a more traditional Batman story at it's core while doing the more omage to the 60s as a wrapping and it doesn't really work. It's probably why Jim Carrey and Tommy Lee Jones are such scene stealers they're unburdened by the more serious nature of the protagonists subplots. Hell the Robin stuff is the most serious stuff in the movie but it's also the most boring, I can't get behind the guy struggling with vengence and loss because he expressed his anger by fighting a neon glowstick gang. I don't care about your motivation when I can just watch you fight the neon glowstick gang. I have a similar problem with Batman (btw Val Kilmer underrated here) but also the movie kind of just contrives his character development. At the beginning it's these repressed memories that just reveal why he chose a bat but then in the third act it becomes as living as both Batman and Bruce. The two seem disconnected from each other the former only barely makes sense within the story as it relates to Nicole Kidman's thirst for Batman. Speaking of which Nicole Kidman's character was the protagonist I liked most in the film, simply because her unapologetic lust for Batman is way more entertaining then any other characters feelings or drama. I mean seriously who INVITES masked men you don't know with a "scarred psyche" to your place so you can get laid??????? What a legend But anyway there's a lot to enjoy here if you can past what I couldn't. I would encourage giving this a second chance if you haven't
6/10 Although falling short of the pre-established dark tone that was present in the previous and much better installments, Batman Forever is a perfectly functional and light superhero action film that never fails to entertain. Also this is the first Batman film that really tries to develop the tortured character of Bruce Wayne but the bulk of those exceptionally done scenes were unfortunately cut to lighten the tone of the film and there in lies the film's huge problem is that it feels toned down to appeal to the younger audiences which is completely wrong, the previous Batman film, Batman Returns, wasn't for children and it was all the better for it because it was a mature and violent film that challenged the mind of the viewer with it's excellent antagonists. Here this just feels like a Saturday morning cartoon, fun but ultimately rather disposable. I'm not trying to say that kids shouldn't be allowed to enjoy Batman, the animated series and 60s television show are very much kid friendly and can be enjoyed by all ages however the films are, or at least Warner Bros. claim, made for the fans and I think if you are going to make a Batman film aim it at adults and don't be scared to be a dark, I think my point is proven by the success of Christopher Nolan's trilogy some years later. Although it's a very fun and entertaining film with some excellent character moments, Batman Forever is a let down because it feels like a kids film and not the dark adult superhero films that came before which were franchise highlights for me.
not to sound pretentious or anything but i miss when marvel and dc (marvel specifically) didn't have such a monopoly on their characters and they actually let a director with a vision make their movies. like yeah this is bad but how did we go from robin fighting a blacklit neon biker gang in a rainbow graffiti alley to your movie not being okayed by the studio execs until you put the grey vsco ig filter on it. extra half star for the butt shot.
35/100 The nipples.... *Ryan Reynolds "but why" gif*
this movie is worse than batman & robin, and that’s saying something
Two years after the masterpiece that was The Fugitive, Tommy Lee Jones has really let himself go.
Painfully bad...nauseating...two face and riddler are the same character, and they’re both so tiresome...seriously some of the worst shit I’ve ever seen
when will the dceu release movies that give off this kind of gay energy /:
Just, so bad. I only watched this because I had to do an article on all the Batmen for a film website I write for, but boy is Val Kilmer a cheesy Batman. And he's not even the worst part, what the hell are Tommy Lee Jones and Jim Carrey doing? Their performances are HORRIBLE! Nicole Kidman was the only good thing in this pathetic film. Especially comparing it to Nolan's thrilogy this is just a bloody joke.
In all aspects: color, dialogue, tone, aesthetic quality, and plot, it's a Saturday morning children's cartoon. I can see why people don't like it - it veers far away from both Burton's two gothic adventure films and Nolan's serious action vehicles and embraces campy shlock and profound silliness. I mean, there's a montage of Robin doing laundry for Christ's sake. Pure ridiculous shlock.
THE GOOD THINGS: - Parts of it are so entertaining that they don't deserve to be written off as completely stupid (Jim Carrey as The Riddler) - Some moments hit the mark when it comes to the character of Batman (the flashback scenes to the cave) - The new design for Gotham City is very creative even though the CGI does not hold up. THE BAD THINGS: - Parts of it are so stupid that they can't be considered entertaining (Tommy Lee Jones as Two-Face) - Some scenes completely miss the point of what Batman is about ('Chicks dig the car', 'I'll get Drive-thru') Batman Forever is a very mixed bag. It is definitely not a good movie and is a radical shift in tone and style to the previous two movies but it features enough entertaining elements to warrant a re-watch.
This movie is insane and I love it. Come at me.
As much as I hate admitting it, I actually enjoyed Batman Forever quite a bit. In all its cartoonishness (the title and poster alone do a good job capturing the essence of the film), it has a lot of charm, which is more than I can say about other bad superhero movies that I have watched. In a foolish attempt to distance itself from what made Burton's Batman so iconic, while also trying to maintain the depth of the previous two films, it's doing its own messy thing. It's a lot to juggle and that in and of itself is entertaining to watch (despite all the problems that are natually part of the package, of course). While I wish we could've gotten a real continuation to Burton's previous two films, I'm really glad we got this wonderful hot mess. I don't think I'll go anywhere near Batman & Robin though. This was more than enough for me.
I can imagine someone who’s first Val Kilmer movie was this thinking: “Really? This guy’s an actor?”
Seeing as though it's summer and I am being too lazy to drive across town to the library to rent anything new at the local library I figured I might as well give another watch to the live action Batman movies. Because, really, life is long and you have plenty of time to sit through this piece of garbage again. There are people out there who think that this is a better movie than "Batman and Robin". And while comparing two terrible things is a little silly, I have to say that I found this one to be way harder to watch than "Batman and Robin". Val Kilmer is probably my least favorite Batman. I would almost applaud his effort to portray the most bored human being ever if it weren't so ridiculously boring to actually watch. Tommy Lee Jones is terrible, Chris O'Donnell is terrible, Nicole Kidman is pretty terrible. And I don't think I need to say a whole lot about Jim Carrey in this, but he was seriously unwatchable in this. This has the same issues as "Batman and Robin" but features no bad ice puns and does not have that really good Smashing Pumpkins song in it (and the U2 single, "Hold Me, Kiss Me, Thrill Me", never sounds like more than a mediocre demo to me). This was pretty hard to get through.
The third film in the series has director Joel Schumacher taking over and we have Val Kilmer in the role of Bruce Wayne. This time out Batman comes under attack from Two-Face (Tommy Lee Jones) and The Riddler (Jim Carrey) as he must deal with the death of his parents as well as the feelings he has for Dr. Meridian (Nicole Kidman). It's strange that I felt BATMAN and BATMAN RETURNS featured terrific villains but a rather forgettable hero and the exact opposite happened here. I really enjoyed the change of pace that the screenplay went for as there's no question that Wayne is the main focus and I liked that we started to get some of his psychological stuff dealing with the death of his parents. All of this worked quite well and I even enjoyed the silly relationship he had with the Kidman character. The main problem with this movie are the villains who are just too boring and annoying. Two-Face isn't that bad but I think he's a step back from the previous two films. I really didn't care too much for the make-up and even the great Tommy Lee Jones couldn't bring too much life to the role. Carrey is basically playing himself and not really a character. His early scenes as the doctor are incredibly bad, over-the-top and they just come across very annoying. He fairs a little better as The Riddler but not enough to keep this from being the weakest villain so far. The rest of the performances are good. Kidman makes for a nice love interest and Chris O'Donnell is strong as Robin, although you could certainly argue whether or not the character should have been added. Drew Barrymore even gets a few good moments in her small part. As for Kilmer, I thought he made for the best Batman of the original four films. I thought the performance was rather deep and he managed the action scenes just fine. Schumacher isn't a favorite director of mine and while he makes for some pretty scenes here, I can't help but think another director might have done a bit better. Still, BATMAN FOREVER is the best of the original four films and is worth seeing.
after the dark and mature Batman Returns (1992) studio brought joel schumacher to deliver more light hearted and kid frienldy take on the caped crusaider and so begun to load the bullet that killed the batman movies for nine years to the gun. still ship riddler and two face tho
It's so bad it's funny, so it has that going for it. I was laughing 100% throughout the entire movie. "I cannot sanction your buffoonery."
Ya Batman forever is pretty rad... Prime alpha Val Kilmer is pretty rad... The Robin sidekick character is pretty rad... The Seal song at the end is pretty rad...
Gone is the dark-fantasy vibe of the first two Batman movies directed by Tim Burton, and now comes a neon-lit, glow-in-the-dark mishmash of colors! In other words, the era of Joel Schumacher! We also have a change of cast; Val Kilmer stars for his first and last time as Bruce Wayne, Batman, and joining him is Chris O'Donnell as Dick Grayson. Joining them is our lord and savior Nicole Kidman, cast as Doctor Chase Meridian. As for the villains, comedy king Jim Carrey is the Riddler, and Tommy Lee Jones is Two-Face. What do I think of Batman Forever . . . I'm not going to say this is the worst movie ever made. No, there are far worse movies than this, even DC movies. However, it doesn't change the fact that Forever is a massive step down in quality compared to the first two Batman movies of the time. The plot is sporadic and unbalanced(is Edward Nygma's masterplan ever utilized? The first half sets up Ed hypnotizing all of Gotham with his machines, and then . . . it just becomes a plot to kill Batman). The action is nothing special to speak of. The bright flashing colors of a newly decorated Gotham City doesn't help the eyes at all. And as for the acting . . . did Joel Schumacher tell everyone to camp it up intentionally? Maybe he did. I wouldn't doubt it. Seriously, everyone from the "chicks dig cars" Batman to moaning-while-rubbing-hands-down-the-Batsuit Chase Meridian to the really awfully campy reporter is not at all amusing. And as for the Riddler and Two-Face, they're the campiest of them all. Chris O'Donnell's Robin took my liking at first. He seemed to be the only one of the cast who showed actual emotion, I'll admit. But halfway through the movie, he became cocky and arrogant, unreasonably angsty. I would say Michael Gough's Alfred Pennyworth is the only character who isn't downgraded, but that really isn't speaking much. For a children's movie which actually does feel like a campy movie with a severely underdone script, there are certainly a lot of sexual innuendos that'll go over kids' heads. I don't know why they put them in Batman Forever, and I don't wanna know. This third installment of the Batman franchise left a bad taste in my mouth.
I actually enjoy this Batman movie. Must be nostalgia eyes or something. Val Kilmer wasn't bad in the title role, but I didn't like Nicole Kidman's character in the film. Just too token love interest. As for Jim Carrey as The Riddler, man he hammed it up in that role!
Let’s all stop pretending like this isn’t fun as hell and Val Kilmer isn’t the second best, second hottest, Bruce Wayne. Also, there’s no reason why Dick Grayson was that hot but he was and I’m thankful.
Style over substance, or as I like to think, style as the substance. The last I saw this, I believe I found Jim Carrey's performance to be annoying, and while it's intentionally (if that matters) over the top, I now find it fun and in that way he embodies the new direction Shumacher wanted to take this series. Thankfully Carrey's performance seems genuine only because it's the kind of performance we know to be natural to Jim Carrey, so somehow I don't get the impression he's trying too hard. Batman Forever's embrace of camp and buffoonery works to a certain degree, but after a while it can seem stale or at least unfulfilling. The vibrant and weird vision is certainly refreshing to revisit though. Even if it's dumb, insofar as its not grounded in much of anything intellectual or serious, it captures the spirit in its tone that probably gets at what most people actually like about superheroes and comics - they're over the top, action packed, display an elaborate clash between ideologies and personalities, and tap into some kind of imagination that extends just enough from reality to be worth thinking about. Its the heightened details like wardrobe, setting, backstories and m.o.'s. Comics are cartoons, and Schumacher embraces that with camp, gothic undertones and humor.
After watching Hereditary I needed something easier. Batman forever is for sure easier and stupider. A very hard movie to rate because it is besides Val Kilmer an all around terrible performances, ridiculous writing and world building but I mean it’s cheesy fun. You can’t really hate on it either but it is a really bad movie.
the craziest thing about batman forever is how hot val kilmer is in it.
When I was a kid this was pretty much the best thing that ever happened. I was like six when it came out and I still have the McDonald's glasses to this day. Then I grew up and I pretty much put it aside and thought it was terrible, especially during the Nolan years. But by blind simple doo-da luck, my heart had rewarmed to BATMAN FOREVER. It's flashy, frustrating and largely nonsensical, less of a narrative movie and more of a pop art installation. But it has some neat insights into Batman, it gets the majority of the Robin beats right, and Carrey's Riddler is like Frank Gorshin playing Jim Carrey, which is kind of just fascinating to watch. It has a lot of missteps, but it handles itself with so much confidence that it's hard not to like. This isn't remotely realistic storytelling, its only substance is its style. But as such it can be dazzling and ridiculous in equally entertaining doses. I turned my nose up at it for years, but I've come to sanction its buffoonery.
I enjoyed this when it came out but it is two fun baddies away from being as shit as Batman and Robin.
Each time i’ve watched this ive either watched drunk, high or both. I’m into the way this film lets me learn something new every time, starting with noticing the batnips, into your 40th watch and hearing Jim Carry wanted to shave a question mark into this scalp but was undergoing divorce hearings at court so he couldn’t.
i was fucking blasted when i watched this but i just remember certain moments like when the helicopter crashed into the statue of liberty.
Jim Carrey is attracted to men Okay let's get serious, I did like the movie but it's fucking weird.
How can I hate a film that’s Sontag’s “Notes on Camp” made flesh (and rubber)?  Takes as much inspiration from the original show as Burton’s films, and the result works way better than you remember. Envisioning The Riddler as a jilted stalker is more successful than whatever was going on with Two-Face, but you can’t win them all. The sets and shots are more theatrical than cinematic, if that makes any sense. Feels like a Vegas show at times.
I promised myself when I watched this movie all those years ago and it started to ruin the Batman franchise for me I would never watch this again. But I wanted to not only for the change, but as I’m older now I might be more open to it. It was better then I remembered but not as great as the Michael Keaton and Christian bale batman’s.
Why the hell is Bruce Wayne always telling 'his little secret' to every single lady he flirt with even when he doesn't remember her at all in the sequel? And most importantly, why is always Alfred supporting this wildness just to smiles in the distance when Batman is kissing other people? Keep that old man away from Robin
A studio-mandated tack away from the darkness of Burton's Gothic pulp leaves Shumacher's first entry in the Bat franchise lost between neo-noir pulp nihilism and kitschy comic book optimism, with a caustic hysteria hanging to the resulting amalgam that dooms its attempts at tongue-in-cheek humor as well as the psychological depth screenwriter Goldsman attempted to insert. The performances are equally blitzed, from Kilmer's Adam West pastiche--with an added layer of smarm and irony that deflate the very guilelessness that was West's charm--to the bizarre villains where Jones's manic ham giddiness is vastly preferable to Carey's antic slapstick hysteria--although, he too, has some stand out moments of complete, go-for-broke insanity. Schumacher and Goldblatt opt for a visual aesthetic that similarly seeks to meld the worlds, resulting in a nite-glo-tinted noir grotesque that channels the cheeky hyperactivity of the '60s incarnation in its wacky angles and quirky imagery but sets in the murky darkness of Burton's Gotham.
For some reason I thought this would be campy fun, but it's far more dour than I remember. Just long, dull scenes of Nicole Kidman and Bruce Wayne talking about psychology. Also, all the Robin stuff is boring, and both the villains suck, and everything else sucks too. Solid soundtrack though. Nicole Kidman throwing up the bat signal wearing a nightie cause she's trying to smash is funny though.
Jim Carrey’s charisma couldn’t even save this.

When you walk in the room and this movie is playing, you should probably walk out
The first and only time I watched this movie, my cousin mentioned meeting Nicole Kidman and I've been seething ever since.

People should give "Batman Forever" a shot for Val Kilmer's strong, competent performance of the caped crusader, himself. However, the dramatic changes in its casting, the Batmobile's new disturbingly phallic look and the franchise's shift to a more ridiculous, slap-happy tone can make "Batman Forever" a difficult sequel to stomach for purists of the first two films.
Okay. I get it. It's goofy. It's big, it's crazy, it's campy. But, hey. Y'know what else? Batman Forever might just be the most complete of the original four Bat flicks. I'm not kidding. I love Batman '89, and tolerate Batman Returns more than most, but in terms of what I'd watch between those two, this, and the abomination that followed? I will gladly, scratch that, happily watch this over any of them. For me, Batman Forever works so much better in some respects than the Burton films because it actually puts Batman and Bruce Wayne at the center. This was something that '89 and Returns didn't do as well. With Burton, it always felt like he was more interested in the villains than he was in the psychological aspects, or any aspects, of Batman and Bruce Wayne. Seriously, d'you ever wonder why Nicholson was billed over Keaton in the first movie? This film takes that issue and does away with it entirely, and is all the better for it. Here, Batman actually feels like a hero. Better yet, he actually feels like Batman, something Returns especially failed at. This film succeeds because it actually gives Bruce an arc, one that is actually understandable and relatable. As mentioned earlier, the movie is campy, but it doesn't detract from the experience. If anything, the movie is all the better for it. It's appropriately silly and goofy when it wants to be, but proves that it can be serious when it needs to be. And what's wrong with silliness? Here, the silliness is reserved for the action and for the villains, and its strongest there. The darker, more mature scenes are saved for scenes between Bruce and Chase discussing his troubled past, or scenes with Bruce simply talking to Alfred in the lair over his concern for Dick's desire for vengeance, but according to most people on the internet, this is called being 'tonally awkward'. I really couldn't disagree more, and find that the film strikes a good balance of tone. I'm not saying that Forever is flawless, and it certainly isn't a masterpiece either. There are some things that bug me about it, why the Hell is Bruce acting like Vicki and Selina never existed, why does Dick necessarily have to live with Bruce when he's clearly old enough to take care of himself, and the neon lights can get a little tiresome on the eyes. Overall, Batman Forever is still an entertaining and, dare I say it, under-appreciated movie. For all of the silly things in it, it's still a well-acted, well-shot movie with a good balance of tone and a fucking brilliant score. Seriously, listen to the track 'Batterdammerung' for proof. Happy 23rd anniversary to my most rewatchable original Batman movie, Batman Forever. I give this criminally under-appreciated movie an 8.3/10, which equals a grade of a B+.
Batman Forever is a massive disappointment. Joel Schumacher stepped in to direct and he did...something. Whether it's good or not is up to you. I don't like the incredibly cheesy writing. I also thought they could've done a better job with casting because Val Kilmer isn't exactly an intimidating ninja with a batsuit and Christopher O'Donnell isn't exactly the greatest Robin. Tommy Lee Jones could have been great as Two-Face but the writing turned him into Joker with half a face. The same thing is wrong with Jim Carrey as the Riddler. However, this is still a fun and enjoyable film. It has it's moments but it is still a hige letdown.
I like this one fuck me I guess
Not sure what WB was thinking but this movie was just ridiculous and only the next movie in this franchise makes this one bearable.
What I like: Nicole Kidman What I didn't like: It was a mistake to produce this movie without Tim Burton as the director. Val Kilmer was a mistake and also Tommy Lee Jones. I thought he was a new character but his character was also in the previous film played by another actor. The change in the cast did not make sense and Robin sucked eggs in this movie.
Not amazing, pretty safe. But worth a watch honestly.
Colorful. Garish. Obnoxious. Ridiculous. Box Office gold. A decent enough vehicle for Carrey's ever-unsubtle shenanigans but Tommy Lee Jones should be ashamed of himself. Kilmer's performance feels like he flat lined and the crew forgot to check his pulse. Loses half a star for being rambling and dull. This hour and a half film feels like four.
I rated this above The Dark Knight for the Seal song. “Kiss from a Rose” is iconic.
Batman Forever is a unique animal to be sure. On the one hand the film tried some new angles for the franchise including introducing Robin, exploring Batman's dual identities, and embracing Burton's darkness alongside the campiness of the 60's Adam West series. Schumacher's unique neon aesthetic and the well cast villains that playing off each other superbly are also highlights of the film. On the other hand uneven plot structure, wooden dialogue/acting, and a lackluster love interest drag the film down somewhat. Not the best but far from the worst. I'll always have a soft spot for it.
Better than the second one, as long as you completely throw believability out of the window it's fun enough to watch
Joel Schumacher, to quote your own movie to you: "Has anyone ever told you that you have a SERIOUS impulse control problem?!"
Stupid, over the top, cheesy... but oddly watchable- after Burton’s gothic fairytale masterpieces, Schumacher doubled-down on the neon and ordered extra ham... and while not good is fun... now at the time it seemed an awful idea, but with where Batman vs Superman and Justice League went, this plays as a more fun and more coherent movie- who would of thought that? Time seems to have been kind to this one!
This is still pretty bad. Despite having more charm to it then the next film, but it's still really bad. Val Kilmer is the Cape Crusader this time. He is fighting Harvey Dent, Two Face after a acid attack. Two Face kills young acrobat, Dick's family, turning him into Robin. Meanwhile, Edward Nigma vows to suck out the brains of Gotham's residents as he runs around in green tights and red hair. After the success of Burton's two films. Ushering in a darker side to comic book films Joel Schumacher took five steps backward and brought it back to that goofy side. Neon colors of purple and green, horribly pitched one-liners dialog and of course...bat nipples. Kilmer isn't the best Batman, not as good as Bale or Keaton. He is though a good Bruce Wayne. Playing the psychologically damaged playboy try well and it suits his desires for the sexy Nicole Kidman character. But god damn if Chris O'Donald isn't one of the most annoying characters in all of cinema. Whiney, bitchy, with his stupid priced earring. Also, what the hell was the with the Robin punch line on the moving rock? He goes from hard edge revenge seeker to that?! Now let's talk about Tommy Lee Jones and Jim Carrey. Jesus Christ. The Riddler and Two-Face are probably two of Batman's low key opponents. They don't relay on overly dramatic entrances because they don't play to their own drum, like The Joker. They are simply fed up and want to cause havoc. Here though they dance around like two kids hopped up on Halloween candy. Also the homosexual innuendos between the two is pretty apparent. Something Schumacher was not afraid to showoff. With that and the constant crouch and ass shots of men in rubber suits. I'm not prejudice or anything, but damn can you make it anymore obvious? I don't hate it though. Despite the odd choice of characteristics it's fun to watch the villains, Kilmer really plays it serious for the Bruce Wayne character and Nicole Kidman is....let's just say I love Australia because of two things; Koalas and Nicole Kidman in this film.
In Jim Carrey's contract it said: “Just be yourself times a million. Oh, and were sorry that Tommy Lee Jones hates you.”
Kilmer is impressively bland as Bruce Wayne. I know the joke has been run into the ground, but the Bat-Nipples really are ridiculous.
Holy shit i forgot this existed
What a bunch of crap...
Seriously, they should have put Kiss from a Rose in the movie proper. I would have given it an extra half a star. The movie contained dreadful acting from all except Tommy Lee Jones. The storyline was uninteresting. It was, all in all, a waste of two perfectly good hours.
Oh jeez.. this is the worst Batman movie I have watched thus far. Jim Carrey as The Riddler may very well be the most annoying and unbearable character in movie history!  I do have to admit that Batman Forever does have its own kind of weird nineties charm though. I like the colors used and the overall vibe. In a way it is so bad that it kind of becomes a little entertaining, but it does not help it much. It still sucks! I guess that I just have to watch Batman & Robin now to find out which one is really the bottom of the barrel when it comes to Batman movies.
My dude Schu may not be great at action but he is great at cape swirls (more here)
I don’t know how I forgot how bad this is.
So, after parents complained that Tim Burton had made his "Batman" films took dark in tone, the studio apparently designed to change everything about those films and make Batman into a completely different character. Joel Schumacher was the director the studio chose to change the direction, because apparently his previous films weren't dark at all. I guess the studio never watched "Flatliners" or "Lost Boys." But, I mean, for the lighter tone they wanted, Schumacher was the perfect tone, because he managed to make a very light Batman. When I was younger, I really enjoyed this film. I didn't know that much about quality at the time, but I thought this film had some pretty good moments and that it was ultimately a good time. Now that I'm older, I realize that I was pretty stupid as a kid and had no taste, because this film is not a good one. I don't know what prompted the studio to make some of these changes that completely destroyed the character. There are some things I do enjoy about this film. First of all, I actually think Val Kilmer was a pretty good choice to replace Michael Keaton. He gives a lot of the same vibes that Keaton did, but without making a complete impression of Keaton. He is definitely a different incarnation of the character, but with the mannerisms that made Keaton such a great fit for the character. I will always have a special place for Keaton in my heart, but I will also say that Kilmer did a very good job as this character. Jim Carrey was the thing I loved the most about the film when I was younger, and he is still the shining light in this film. I know that Carrey is pretty much just playing a version of himself on screen, but I like that decision. The Riddler has been featured in many different incarnations, but the crazy version has always been my favorite, so I very much enjoy to see Carrey go all crazy. There are some pretty good action scenes in the film. The scene I always go to the most is when the Riddler is destroying the Batcave. That scene was very well-shot, and well acted by Carrey. It's also one of those scenarios that I never thought I would see on the screen, so that also infused some positivity into my mind. I also like the third act fight sequences. There are some incredible camera-work done when Batman is flying in the Batwing, and also when he is falling towards his death in a pit. I like those moments, even though the third act is a little ridiculous. And there ends my positives, because this is a very flawed film. I hate the screenplay for the film, and it was written by someone who would eventually go on to win an Oscar. Right from the opening scene of the film, it's very clear that this is a cheesy approach to the Batman character, and I hated every single cheesy lined that followed the first one. Batman was never that character. Not even in 1960s did he have such horrible lines, and that was a very cheesy version of the character. Cheesy is not funny, and this film definitely proves that point. There are so many characters that I don't like. Nicole Kidman's character and her relationship with Bruce Wayne felt so incredibly forced and I didn't even believe the storyline that made the two of them meet up. And Dick Grayson is such a douchebag in this film that it's hard to like him. It's very hard to root for him, so when he has that moment at the end where he realizes that he can't live by hate, I didn't believe it, because I didn't believe the character or any of his motivations. By far, the worst character in this film is Two-Face. I didn't get anything from him. I didn't get his motivations for hating Batman, nor I did the reason why he was all of a sudden crazy. I also think his transformation should have been a bigger part of the film, instead of just something shown on the television. And I don't understand why Tommy Lee Jones felt like he had to play a different version of the Joker. I never remember reading anything about that approach when I first read about Two-Face in the comicbooks. He is crazy, but is not the newest Joker in town. This film also looks terribly fake. There are so many visual effects shots of the city, and in all of them, it looks like something I could have done on a computer. I don't know what the budget was wasted on, but it definitely wasn't the visual effects. There are also some really bad shots of a full CGI-character, and sometimes when they interact with real things, it makes the film look like an un-finished videogame sequence. This is not a film that I will recommend. There are a few shining parts, but ultimately, the film fails. It was an attempt to reintroduce Batman with a different tone to the public, but instead, they managed to destroy everything that was ever Batman, and I can never understand why.
an easy way to tell apart gays and straights is to ask their opinion on this movie and if they say its bad. just assume theyre straight and not worth your time
This third outing goes for laughs instead of darkness and the results are a little mixed. Kilmer is fine is the lead and the film does benefit from Carrey and Jones as the bad guys but it's playful nature does not match the surroundings. It still entertains though.
Batman Forever is entertaining, but Two Face is just a goofball with silly make up, and Riddler was just Jim Carry being Jim Carry. This movie seems to be more colorful and comedic. I just feel this was trying to be much more mainstream.
It may not be the best Batman movie, but compared to Batman & Robin it might as well be The Godfather. Flawed as it is, Batman Forever boasts two satisfyingly over the top performances from Jim Carrey and Tommy Lee Jones, with Carrey in particular being the best part of the movie, even if that’s not saying much. Val Kilmer isn’t great as Batman or Bruce Wayne, but he is decent, and he’s much better than George Clooney. That being said, then action is good, the script is surprisingly good, and the film as a whole is fun but doesn’t make you think.
Birth Year Challenge film #3: Some truly bad, campy, gay, gay, GAY fun. God, it's so fucking gay. Joel Schumacher, please save Batman from Zach Snyder and Ben Affleck!
Birth Year Challenge Film 1 So, turns out I had watched this one before, but I'm still gonna count it because, a, I probably wouldn't have watched it again if it weren't for this challenge and, b, the only thing i actually remembered was Sugar and Spice looking hot because apparently I was a big, horny dyke when I was a kid. Honestly, this was a delight. It was so supremely gay. Jim Carrey looked like Annie Lennox serving up some Purge a la Space Channel 5 Part 2 glam one-piece realness. Tommy Lee Jones kept almost kissing the Riddler. Obviously, bat nipples. Obviously, Robin wearing that stupid, little earring and running around the Wayne manor like a twink. I mean, we all know that it was gay, but I just wanted to say that I was impressed and I appreciated what the film was doing.
objectively this movie is Bad but if ur Gay u know it's a true masterpiece
“I always hated those titles like ‘Batman Forever’. That sounds like a tattoo that somebody would get when they’re on drugs or something. Or something some kid would write in the yearbook.”             — Tim Burton  This is a bit of a Rorschach test in that you see what you want to see in it. The film I’m describing here will probably not come across as the film someone else watched—objectively I know that this is like, very very bad, and many people whose opinions are more credible than mine have said it’s a total stinker. But I think it’s kind of a brilliant stinker, and one that I’m still openly enthusiastic about. Batman Forever is possibly one of the campiest displays of excess ever put to screen, and one of the most enjoyable. Aside from a few initial CGI faux-pas in the first half hour or so, the film is gorgeous; and I say that with utmost honesty. Bob Ringwood and Ingrid Ferrin design costumes with a sharply clear vision and an intricacy that’s honestly breathtaking, no matter how brightly camp they are. It all comes together to create the sense of a mishmash, technicolour stage production that was somehow thrust onto the big screen, an accidental jackpot of charm and idiosyncrasy.  The staple areas of the city are created and destroyed in a devilishly unique way, with every set piece going out in a slow motion crumble and a flurry of blinding sparks. Barbara Ling’s production design paints Gotham as rich and claustrophobic; successfully combining gothic architecture with neoclassical imagery and striking, soft-lit neons. The only way I can think to describe it is to say it’s a sort of beta-vapourware kind of style, if that aesthetic movement took itself less seriously and harkened back to the 60s instead of the 80s. It plays with the idea of a place that speaks to both the past and the future, like the Roman statues looming over the electric city as a constant reminder of a bygone pre-industrial age. Similarly, Riddler’s space-age holographic technology is constantly at odds with his tiny apartment filled with archaic machinery and riddles shrouded in card and glue. The whole film grapples with the idea of paradox or duality, and it exists in nearly all of the major player characters: Two-Face for obvious reasons, Bruce coexisting with Batman, Chase’s struggle with reason and desire, Dick’s dual wish for revenge and justice. I mean, none of these ever get developed in any concrete way but hey, the sentiment was there I guess.  This pretty cerebral sentiment knits together the entirely goofy script, which is kind of like saying there’s a solid gold foundation holding up a house made out of mud. The thing is, the goofy dialogue and laughable story arcs are really, really fun. I never end up caring that the storyline is full of conveniences and doesn’t make any sense, because I’m too busy having such a good goddamn time.  Because of this, the film itself is a stumbling paradox: with its attempt cheesy humour becoming wildly nonsensical and the more serious aspects of the film becoming so laden with tropes that it speaks more to the satirical than the emotional. The weird thing is that this doesn’t massively sink it, and it works spectacularly well as an openly bizarre romp that seeks to obliterate classic comic book stereotypes by exposing how stupid they are. And yeah, that sounds pretentious and douchey, but I’m still trying to justify just how much I enjoy this every time I watch it.   Also, the amount of trivia that has stuck around in my brain about this film is shocking. Tommy Lee Jones and Jim Carrey try to out act each other in every scene they’re in because Jones apparently hated Carrey and reportedly said, to his face, that he couldn’t “sanction [his] buffoonery.” Val Kilmer didn’t talk to the director for two weeks because he told him to stop acting childish and treating other cast members rudely. There’s a shot of one of the extras fully falling down the stairs that they just kept in for some reason. This will all haunt me forever. It’ll haunt me Batman Forever.
what can i say? im gay and i love to have fun!!
Playful, silly, immature, bad writing, lacking proper plot structure but hey; a good film is a good film.
In a film brewing with Freudian ideology and sexual undertones, Bruce Wayne/Batman addresses his psychological and emotional trauma that he's suppressed since childhood. In the midst of French horns, brightly lit neon lights, and imagery of the human body, Bruce faces the questions about himself he never could before and fosters a surrogate family of his own. Chase Meridian serving as the mother figure, and Robin as a son for whom can be raised by the father Bruce never had. Admittedly the film is mostly a fleeting but enjoyable lighthearted live action comic book adventure and doesn't strive to be much more than that, but it is nice to have something underneath the surface and time given for the characters to live and breathe.
Nolan could never.
guilty pleasure
It's like Joel Schumacher was given a one sentence description of a few Batman characters and added nipples.
I’ve come to the conclusion that Batman is kind of a boring character. (This is coming from someone who *loves* The Long Halloween.)
I’m more partial to this movie than most other people since I saw it at a young age and before the original Batman. Still, you can see shades of the far worse sequel here.
Imagine how much better this would be if it didn't have Jim Carrey and Tommy Lee Jones giving career worst performances? The rest of this outside of them is complete and utter nonsense but as I'll get to with Batman & Robin, I don't hate what Schumacher did with this franchise and I still to this day absolutely love the music. Just a shame about y'know, those villains. Ugh.
It's this kind of garbage that keeps good stories from coming out of Hollywood and nearly killed the Batman franchise.
Batman Forever is a class act in how to make a horrible film. This movie is so bad that it’s laughable. You could literally sit for a little over an hour and a half and just laugh at how stupid this film really is. Perhaps the only upside to this movie is that they made Jim Carrey the Riddler. That is the only good thing. Batman Forever is a film that should be avoided at all costs.
