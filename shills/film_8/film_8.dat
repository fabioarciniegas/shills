Alexander Payne's downsizing worked for me, it was funny, it had ideas. It wasn't the best film he's made but it was a pretty solid political satire about how modern capitalism will get more efficient but still be based on exploitation, will isolate you, and still ruin the planet.   Seriously, what was with the music.
This movie started out fine, but it got stereotypical and predictable and cheesy and boring if I'm being honest. I didn't really want to finish watching it but I did just because I felt an obligation to.
This movie had no idea what it wanted to be. I gave it 2.5 because there were a lot of good moments and a lot of possibilities but this was horribly paced, deceitfully marketed, and borderline schizophrenic in message, tone, and quality.
Deeply rich and under-appreciated. A twisting satire of the ways in which we get caught up in marrying the idea of our future happiness to systemic structures like capitalism, politics, and religion as we miss the deep wells of meaning right in front of our faces.
Stop this movie after the first act and you actually have a pretty good short film
This is an interesting one. The initial premise is absolutely genius. Obviously, the concept of shrinking people isn't an new one for films to be dealing with. But using it for environmental reasons but from the point of view of the average person, for capitalist values of being richer and being able to buy more stuff. All this sounds like it's going to add up to a pretty good and very interesting film and it does... for about 45 minutes. After this, the film takes a deep dive down many little tangential rabbit holes and make the film seem confused and muddled. The film is too self-obsessed with its message and the feelings of Matt Damon to capitalise on the basic raw genius of its premise. Which is truly a shame.
i’ll never understand payne’s cheap sentimentalism or why he constantly undercuts it with even cheaper humor like the horrendous “what kind of fuck” monologue first 45 minutes or so are pretty interesting but the above complaints plus rolfe kent’s supremely boring score makes most of the film’s novel elements pretty hard to enjoy
There should be some kind of a law against wasting such interesting premises and ideas in such a bland fashion. A massive disappointment from Alexander Payne.
This probably should’ve been either a comedy about Kristen wiig and Matt Damon downsizing or a drama about ngoc’s struggles from her pov. Instead it’s a lil bit of everything and it’s pretty weird.
A soggy, off-putting piece of work, only enlivened by a few fun performances. (As a very specific note: This movie has more puzzling screenwriting decisions than I've encountered in a long time, from opening with 10 solid minutes of slow-ass exposition to the inconsistency of Matt Damon's character.)
Honey, I shrunk the Eat, Pray, Love.
I want to be tiny and ride my dachshund around like a dragon
This film had such a strong beginning and yet the concepts and plots introduced dissipated by the end of the film. In many ways I felt as though I was watching two separate films and wished I could go back to former than latter. This was a hybrid of genres and yet the combination did not transition well. There’s nothing wrong with hybrid genres but I felt like Alexander Payne could not make up his mind as to whether or not this was a romantic comedy or drama. The plot is definitely original and made me wonder what would our society be like if Downsizing was actually real? The disllusionment of Paul (Matt Damon) felt believeable and trying to cope with his new environment after his wife divorces him felt real and left me at the edge of seat wondering what is next for Paul and his life. Looking back now I regret to say I wish I hadn’t ask that question. The minute they introduced Ngoc Lan Tran (Hong Chau) the story went to utter garbage. I have nothing against her acting but the horrific Vietnamese accent (sounded more like redneck hillbilly) was annoying and the stereotypes of Orientalism pervaded immensive with her relationship with Paul. With Ngoc Lan Tran I thought the plot would shift to a drama and having Paul uncover the systematic racism and poor treatment of minorities that would showcase this “Leisureland” is simply a scam and nothing has changed for humans but that whole arc of the story gets glossed over as Ngoc Lan Tran becomes the Savior complex for Minorities. Out of nowhere the characters go to the original colony that begin this whole phenomenon and immediately we get topics of the world ending and survival for mankind and other nonsense that made me pause and wonder... isn’t the world going to end in a couple of hundred years? Why are these people acting like it’s going to happen tomorrow and the fact that we have no conclusive time period in the film made it extremely over the top and the ending felt completely forgettable. As I am writing this now I’ve forgotten 85% of what I just watched.  I wouldn’t recommend this film unless you want to watch the first half and come up with your own conclusions as to how does this movie end. Either way it’s definitely better than what Alexander Payne created.
i mean the 135 minutes of worldbuilding were great and all but where is the plot ?? WHERE IS THE PLOT ??
fake deep matt damon is just *insert that gif of Tiffany Pollard rubbing her temples* too much
Not bad gold to watch on a rainy day. Felt a little long.
While I never had high hopes for the film, 'Downsizing' isn't exactly the film the marketing would have you believe it is. The trailers looked mildly amusing and at least kind of fun, but the movie deals with the ideas of human extinction, global warming, white privilege, and other things that are generally not as much fun. Add all that together and you have a film that struggles to find a voice and a consistent tone, things that are pretty detrimental to the movie as a whole. On a mostly unrelated note, are we seeing the beginning of the end of Matt Damon's career as an A-lister? He's made some comments to the press these past few months that a lot of people have found unsavory, he starred in this, he was in 'The Great Wall' in 2016 that drew a lot of controversy, 'Suburbicon' wasn't very good, even the latest 'Jason Bourne' wasn't very good. I suppose we'll see.
Paul Safranek: He never struck me as the kind of guy who'd go get small. Wow! I want to track down Alexander Payne and be like: what happened here?  The concept for this film is interesting. Matt Damien is a very charismatic charming actor. Christoph Waltz is one of the best actors on the planet. So you take that interesting premise and great actors and make one of the most boring films I’ve ever seen.  It took me two days to watch it because I fell asleep, not a great sign. Normally when I criticize a film I ask questions like why did they do this or why did they do that. This movie: I don’t care. I’m just glad it over.
I love Matt Damon so I watched this and I'm glad because now I love Hong Chau. I saw her in Homecoming before I saw her in this and they did her dirty in this. I despise that she was directed or it was written for her to talk that way, but I guess I get it. I guess it's for comedic purposes, and I guess they think they made up for it by giving her a GG nomination. Either way, she is brilliant and I can't wait to see her in more stuff. Christoph is too good for this but I guess he's there because he's a "fan of the director" like Matt and of course, the check. The story and movie isn't as shit as critics make it out to be. It's cheesy and corny but also kinda cute.   *Saying 'guess' a lot on purpose*
Man, what a wasted concept! This movie could've benefited from being about a half hour shorter. The first half with the downsizing itself was fascinating, then you completely forget anyone is small at all and it turns into Walter Mitty for no reason. I didn't hate either half. It just felt like two half baked movies that could've both been great had they not been half explored. 2/6
Hong Chau is a good actor. I don't know why they needed to make her accent so strong and not completely believable.
Not what you expect. Starts off interesting and intriguing and slowly turns into a puzzled "hunh?!?!?!". Cast was good. Hong Chau steals every scene...the 8 fucks was awesome. I had more questions of how the smalls produced certain items and goods. Decent amount of humor throughout.
This should have been a book.
This should’ve been Hong Chau’s story
This film was surprising and I didn’t hate it.  It was a sci-fi comedy love story that took such a hard left turn I legit might have hit my head.  Here are my reasons for liking this film in order: 1) HONG FREAKING CHAU 2) Christoph Waltz 3) Jason Sudeikis .......  10) Matt Damon. Honestly, I know people were pretty vocal about not liking downsizing and I get it.  It is a DARK comedy that has overtly Christian themes while also involving Christoph waltz as a playboy and the word fuck being said 30 times. There seem to be two VERY opposed audiences that this film is trying to appeal to. There are a 2 main redeeming points for me in this film: 1) an interracial love story 2) a relationship between an able and disable couple that is NOT a tragedy where the disabled person commits suicide (still bitter about Me Before You, clearly). Is it perfect?  CUSS NO! But it is trying and is pretty funny, so I am not about to hate on it!
The only enjoyable part of this film was Hong Chau.
What a bizarre misfire. I watched on Amazon Prime. I was complete with this movie for the first hour, It was strange, funny, and was starting to make fascinating statements about class, privilege, and wealth. Why such smart writers (Payne and Taylor) couldn't figure out where to take the story will vex me for some time.
This might possibly be the worst movie I’ve ever seen
Takes the path least expected of its premise, and while that has the benefit of keeping things unpredictable, it also doesn't really do anything interesting or funny with it. Moralizing and preachy instead of clever and satirical, the film seems more concerned with sermonizing viewers on the dangers of climate change and class warfare than putting a sardonic spin on miniaturization technology. The narrative turns it takes in the second and especially third acts are downright baffling, and the introduction of Hong Chau's character, while obviously well-intentioned, can't help but feel performatively woke and borderline racist. Would rather the film just stayed with Christoph Waltz and Udo Kier's partying Serbs - at least they livened things up.
Extremely uneven film that tackles consistently engaging and pertinent themes in the most meandering way possible. The themes about overpopulation, human connection, and finding your way in the world are all heartfelt and affecting with a lot of thought put into them, but the execution feels messy and the film's runtime drags out the underdeveloped tensions in the story for a long time. The excellent cast is game for the material, unfortunately the material dries up about sixty minutes in, instead replaced with an existential dourness about the state of the world. Hong Chau's character is the best example of the film's good intentions not quite working out. The prevalence of accents, and the language barriers that come with, in the film is notable, and Chau undoubtedly has the strongest accent, and as a result, the most stereotypical. Part of me suspects that Payne's idea was to rub audiences the wrong way, especially since Chau's character is easily the strongest and most interesting in the movie, and conceptually this plays well with the film's most striking themes of interpersonal relationships beyond language, economic, or personal barriers. In practice, it might not be as successful or half as clever as the film thinks. The movie's plot feels remarkably weightless despite the various questions and posed and plot threads teased. The first forty-five minutes or so are fairly breezy and set up the world of Downsizing very efficiently, but the movie's habit of drifting scene-to-scene with no compelling action, emotional or physical, to ground it makes for a sloppy movie that wears its heart on its chest, but keeps its most pointed thoughts intensely private. Damon's character is a waif, and while Payne is perhaps one of the directors best suited to breathe life into a dopey white man, Damon feels vacant and the script does the bare minimum to extend meaning to his character. Despite the movie's numerous problems, I respected it heavily for its ambition and willingness to address issues with a humanistic bent. It's not a movie about personal glory, saving the world, or overcoming great adversity. It's a high-concept, low-key movie about how we utilize the space around us, how, who, and why we interact with the people in our lives, and how we can live our lives in the face of unstoppable climate devastation. Payne's a fascinating filmmaker who is all about human connection. I don't quite think this story, although written by him, is his bag, but the themes it explores are well worth discussing and analyzing.
Just a full two hours of slowly losing respect for a lot of talented people.
I was hoping for more of a “Honey, I Shrunk Matt Damon” type of movie.  I enjoyed the first half but it went in a weird self-serious direction that was neither entertaining or satisfying.
United Artists Court Street 12
Looks like I’m the only one that could completely relate to this movie. Great story, relatible, hilarious! I even cried wow fantastic movie!
Pretty cute film with a nice message , some lovable characters and the story takes some unexpected turns ... I think it could’ve been a better in some ways but overall 👍🏼
Like an incoherent genre mash-up, this movie just didn’t know what it wanted to be. I appreciated its attempt to promote philanthropy, but the whole thing was all over the place thematically, and poorly executed. It wasn’t ever a problem suspending my disbelief in regard to how none of this would actually work economically, politically, or scientifically as suggested, in more ways than the obvious. It was the lack of having a unified story. It really is a shame. I really enjoyed the idea of exploring the concept. I just didn’t jive with the delivery at all. Common Payne. You’re better than this.
Interesting premise with a loud environmental theme, but possibly the worst third and fourth act ever.
This goofy movie has some genuinely moving moments.
"What kind of fuck you give me?"  I can't believe the choices that were made in this film in front of & behind the camera. The tone of this is tragic, the characters are absolute garbage & at times utterly embarrassing, & the writing is almost traumatic to the human mind. In moments that are meant to be weightful with emotion play off as some weird dark comedy? I don't understand what was trying to be accomplished here. I will never forget this in the worst way possible. An interesting concept with an execution that is beyond disaster.
Who turned Alexander Payne into Hippie Jason Reitman? This is the biggest budget Payne has ever been given and the whole thing just looks and moves like shit. The special effects aren't lit properly. The shots are bland. It's a movie with a sci-fi premise, but taking place in ordinary locations with flat lighting. And Payne decides to devote the last hour lecturing to us about the environment rather than dramatizing any of this. If you're going to flaunt your environmental concerns, maybe try not descending into racism with your Vietnamese character straight out of an old SNL skit. Only a director this talented can whiff this hard.
From the half to the end its just a blur. But interesting beginning.
Downsizing. Alexander Payne has made some excellent small budget movies that take place in America’s heartland. With Downsizing, he scales up to a 70 million dollar flick. People, in particular Matt Damon’s everyman character, willingly shrink down to 5 inches. People, in particular Downsizing’s everyman character, leave Omaha after they shrink. That’s a bad idea for both Matt Damon and Downsizing’s narrative. Payne does best when he sticks to what he knows best, Nebraska. 2.59 on the Stumeter.
Honey, I Shrunk Our Carbon Footprint
it's ok I guess
That third act was so bizarre it diminished the super interesting concept and Twilight Zone-esque vibe. Needed more Kristen Wiig!
It was entertaining, made well, and I don’t regret watching it. It definitely veered quickly into unexpected territory and ran too long.
Just average. Half black comedy, half straight drama.
This movie has the potential to be so much better. I wish Kristin Wiig was in it more, she funny as hell. The concept behind it is super interesting even though a rainstorm would kill all of the little people, and 1 bird could eat like 5 of them at a time. Also, humans becoming little is good for the environment, but it's way too far gone so our little bodies wouldn't be able to handle what's coming our way.
Wow I hated this movie so much
It was Friday and I thought I'll watch this and see something like Marvel's Ant-Man (I didn't read pretty much anything of it like I never do because its spoils the watching experience), instead I saw something else. This is exactly what I want from my scifi: science and feelings, lots of big questions and thoughts and a world that's been designed with care. Almost everything worked in this, they just sometimes forgot they're actually small and the proportions especially when arriving to Norway were completely forgotten (I'm not talking about that one village, I'm talking about when they're sailing to there, unless they have downsized whole Norway or exactly that one fjord). Aside from that one quite unforgivable mistake, I liked this movie a lot. I hate it than when this genre's movies have all the possibilities to everything, where they forget all the details and world building? Movies like this are an example how it's very possible to do it in a quite normal length. This was an interesting mix of low-tuned comedy, drama and scifi. From the comedic details I remember that after the downsizing they were picked with spatula and taken to the recovery room. From the political things I remember equality issues (human trafficking in FedEx boxes), from scifi things how they showed the process itself (picking tooths etc), and purely because of aesthetic things how humans look funny when they don't have eye brows. All the actors were good, many times I laughed especially to the characters of Hong Chau and Christoph Waltz. The main character himself, played by Matt Damon, was probably left neutral on purpose. Anime comes to my mind because in them the main characters seem to always been impersonal, probably to create an everyman-effect so that we can concentrate in to the story itself and that side characters bring the story and the world alive. It's debatable is there any sense because... well why to have a main character then? But it's a completely different story. The ending was good. It was predictable (unlike the story so far), but in a good way. The other solution could have worked too but only if this movie would have been made differently or at least have a different tone in it. To this story, it was a great choice. Excellent scifi movie, it's refreshing because I'm almost always disappointed to the movies in this genre.
Unexpectedly good.
Points for original concept that was unfortunately completely wasted. This could've worked so well as a satire on consumerism and modern society but they went off on a stupid tangent. Huge disappointment.
Nope
Downsizing was a very strange movie and I don't really understand what it is or why it exists. It could have been called "Honey, I Shrunk My Mid-Life Crisis". Seriously, this is mostly Matt Damon's life falling apart and him having to figure out who he is now but oh yeah also some people are 5-inches tall, which the movie has to remind you of every so often with (admittedly pretty good) visual gags.  Downsizing really gets going in its second half when Damon meets Hong Chau, whose political dissident -turned -cleaning woman is not only an actual character but an interesting one at that! If this was her movie and in the middle she encountered Damon's character instead of the other way 'round, that's a better movie. Nothing against Matt Damon, who I like just fine, but his character is just boring. Not just that, he's passive, which is Screen Writing No-No Number One. For the most part, everyone he encounters is more interesting that him, but they're also more active. They want things, they do things, you can enjoy them because they give the appearance of substance.  Downsizing reminds me of watered-down Don DeLillo, whose stories feature relatable human drama amidst uncanny events, but unlike Downsizing the two narrative threads will have a sort of thematic resonance. They will harmonize in some way. Downsizing never felt like it appropriately married the "finding yourself" stuff with the "five inches tall" stuff. The script (by director Alexander Payne & Jim Taylor) pays lip service to environmental issues, but literally everything about how they're five inches tall feels like an afterthought. Like, could I rewrite fucking The Graduate but everyone's got a third eye for some reason?  I'd advise you to skip Downsizing except that Hong Chau's performance is legitimately really, really good. So just fast forward until she starts showing up. And for whatever reason, it felt like I was watching it f-o-r-e-v-e-r, so fast fowarding could only help.
Cool concept, HORRIBLE execution. Plot is not good at all.
This film was about 2 hours too long. Could have been good, wasn't.
Wow!  Most true movie fans can ignore bad science if you hide it under enough good story and acting.  They took an interesting concept and buried it with preachy climate change nonsense.  It just made me sleepy.  I’m glad I waited to stream it.
The whole small thing is cool for about 30 minutes. Then halfway you're annoyed and over it. Story as a whole is very shallow
this is essentially a midlife crisis movie with very small people. it’s so midlife crisis that it takes like 1 hour and 40 minutes for paul to catch a single W. i thought this movie was pretty good and i don’t think it deserves the hate that it gets. i wish the movie stuck with what it was going for in the first half tho
Intriguing plot made me press play. Afterward: Hmm.... perhaps I will give this another watch in a bit and see how I feel about it then.
Fuck the haterz.  Downsizing slaps. I felt so many ~ emotions ~.  THE WHOLE MOVIE - I COULDN’T STOP THIKING:                    WOULD I BE BIG OR SMALL?  THE ANSWER: BIG FOREVER BABY. IMAGINE BEING THE LAST BIG BOY. YOU COULD BE LIKE GODZILLA. YOU WOULD LITERALLY BE THE MOST POWERFUL PERSON IN THE WORLD.  DARE I SAY SQUEAKUEL?
Alexander Payne has made some incredible films that I’ve enjoyed immensely, such as Sideways and Election. The concept seemed like a unique idea for him to tackle next and could lend itself to plenty of comedic ideas while also delivering dark humor and scathing satire that he is best known for. But Downsizing is unfortunately an ambitious disaster. I appreciate when a film takes twist and turns that I was not expecting but this film takes its plot into unsatisfying territories. Matt Damon is not only miscast but his character in general might just be the least interesting person any movie could offer. As the lead you get the sense that’s he isn’t actually acting but just spouting out lines at ease.  Alexander Payne’s films are simple yet incredibly effective, but with this being a high concept story the effects and presentation are executed unfortunately very poorly. The look of this film shows that Payne is very inexperienced when it comes to visual effects. As soon as the film first presents a person who has downsized its pretty jarring and unconvincing. As for the concept of downsizing I didn’t really buy it, it’s obviously such a terrible idea that no one would actually want to do. But the film never pokes fun at it instead in the end it proves to be the fucking solution for the human race and not for comedic effects. Oddly I felt like Downsizing  took itself to seriously and just wasn’t funny enough and when the film attempted a joke it didn’t stick its landing because the humor is very far and between.
This was a fine film. I’m truly amazed at the backlash this one received. I found it unpredictable and oddly fascinating. It never reaches levels of perfection but it is a nice little movie made by nice people.
It’s like Cameron Crowe meets Wim Wenders. In a good way.
Saddling your drama about a divorcée's mid-life crisis with an oversized gimmick demonstrates an aversion to risk.
I didn’t expect to like this film. Thought it would be another preaching to the choir movie when in fact it turned out to be way deeper than that. It’s been a while since a movie kept me surprised, and this one did, I kind of loved how every time I thought it had arrived at some kind of ideological message or I could see where the story was going to land, it would take a turn to probe a little deeper. If anything it seemed to be about finding humanity beyond ideology, or personal responsibility beyond ideological identification. Kind of love the screenplay. I also like the tone it maintained while simultaneously being cutting, loving, satirical, celebratory, funny and intelligent. A great fable
Not a good borrowers story. Did someone spend too much time playing fallout?
Matt Damon should never play the normal guy again. He's great when he plays someone exceptional—Will Hunting, Mike McDermott, Mark Watney—and looks normal doing it. But watching such a normal person be a normal person is old, and ruining his career. I understand why folks hated this, but truth is—I'd happily watch it again. Hong Chau is delightful (despite the broken English . . . when will we be done?!). The concept is great, Vera Farmiga is great, Christoph Waltz is great. Damon sucks. The rest is great.
Bite size Fallout mod that is just terrible.
I totally missed this in theaters and managed to catch this on HULU just the other day. I was struck by how deceptive the advertising campaign for Downsizing appears to be. I remember looking at the trailers in the theater and on Youtube and getting the impression this was going to be a lighthearted, goofy semi-comedy where the notion of shrinking life was going to be the driver or "hook" for the film's plot. As it turns out, that is far from being the case. Downsizing really isn't a comedy, although it has some funny moments. Here's the thing; Downsizing really isn't about shrinking people at all. It's a fantasy about divorce, economics, the environment, and scarcity. Downsizing orients itself along the North-South economic divide and clearly sympathizes with the unfortunate and disenfranchised. The central character, Paul Safranek, played with good-natured befuddlement by Matt Damon, goes on a classic journey of self discovery and ethical change. Initially, he seems a little shallow and materialistic, and very dissatisfied with his life. Kristen Wiig plays her classic nervous and excitable wife, Audrey. Initially, they are a couple who decide to undertake a newly-invented procedure to shrink their bodies so they can start a new life in an experimental community called Leisure World. Her decision to back out at the last second and leave Paul leaves him emotionally devastated and totally up-ends his plans to live in luxury in his new shrunken city. The first part of Downsizing is Paul's reaction and adjustment to grieving about his marriage. The second part is Paul rediscovering himself after meeting Ngoc Lan, a Vietnamese activist who was shrunk against her will by her government and smuggled into America. Ngoc Lan introduces Paul to the seedy underbelly of the miniature world he has joined, complete with its own day labor class, illegal immigrants, and scarcity issues. At times, the allegory is a little thick-- understandably. this is a message movie about the impact of rampant consumerism and waste on the environment. Still, it makes for a very compelling movie, with an interesting denouement, complete with the end of the world. Pretty cosmic stuff. What Downsizing isn't, really, is a film about the wacky adventures of a man who miniaturizes himself and has to adjust to being little in a big world. The entire movie could have jettisoned the miniature angle and still be a very watchable and entertaining story. The miniaturizing part is really there to provide a plot device to bring the characters together. I should have expected this from Alexander Payne, whose previous movies share a lighthearted approach to serious subjects. I enjoyed this one, and will watch it again.
Can you say “little people?” Should have been about the Germans.
When I first started watching this I was like why is everyone shitting on this it’s not that bad. And then an hour passed. While the concept is interesting, the actual story they chose to focus on was so boring. Scenes draggeddddddd on.  I did see the message to not forget about those in need even if they don’t have a chance in the future. But that was after thinking about it for a minute. And finally the best part was seeing thee gorgeous Christoph Waltz across my screen.
this took on a more environmental stance than i was expecting and i appreciated that but like, i don't even know what this was about really
I was hesitant to watch this because of all the bad reviews, but Downsizing is excellent. I should’ve never doubted Alexander Payne. I love all his other films, and this is very much an Alexander Payne film—the atmosphere, humor, everything is in his signature dry wit. It’s an excellent movie with a great message, and I can’t wait for his next one.
After a year of hearing how disappointing this movie was, I did not expect much. And I was still disappointed. Great idea, terrible execution. Too much time was spent on scenes that matter little, and scenes that have a lot of heart, or very interesting or funny, are cut off way too soon.
After the first 30 minutes the film itself downsizes on its own primes.
What a strange movie. I had no idea what I was getting into with this one. More plot twists than an episode of Family Guy.  Made me feel a bit sad throughout.
This is a mess. A cool concept but really poorly executed.
A great concept for a movie, but a strange delivery. It's never particularly funny, never particularly biting, engaging, offensive, or exciting. It just sort of plods along from one new plot thread to the next.
Has the same uneasy vibe as The Leftovers and The Lobster but sucks instead of rips. At some point it just stops being about anything.  It has Laura Dern for a minute there though
but why did they have to drag Christoph Waltz into this
A movie so desperately racist, it kinda makes you feel happy for a climate change inflicted end of the world because it’s clearly what white people deserve.
i thought it was a comedy :sadcowboy:
It had a lot of problems. But it wasn't a disaster. It had a lot to say about class, the environment, and what it really means to be "a humanitarian". The trailers and the premise led you to think it was a goofy comedy, and maybe those expectations led to a lot of its bad reviews. In time, perhaps it will get re-evaluated by the critical consensus. Also that village in Norway is kinda where I want to live in real life. But what the hell do they do in winter!?
Great creative idea but somehow doesn’t come together
This film is absolutely a case of false advertising. What trailers seemed to indicate is far different than the film itself but regardless of that and going off the film as it stands on it's own, this feels so aimless. Not sure what it's trying to be in which direction until shuffling for a sense of meaning near the end. I guess you could say, this one came up short.
Not as bad as I expected, but not quite good either. I still enjoyed the film, and I loved Hong Chau in it.
Ultimately middling and forgettable (I forgot to log it yesterday along with the rest of my weekend viewing), Downsizing is ambitious while struggling to focus on any particular message. It's a movie about personal growth under the guise of being about climate change and the destructive nature of man, yet it never fully sells you on the journey of its main character. Matt Damon's character is supposed to be a stand in for all of us, but all of our problems aren't the same and certainly nothing like his. Framing it around the ridiculous, outlandish concept of the movie doesn't really help in that regard. I wish Downsizing were a big more absurd and a little less saccharin. I wish it had more of Hong Chau and spent more time with Kristen Wiig's character to justify her actions. Downsizing leaves you wanting more in the bad way. But it's still entertaining, an easy watch on Netflix if you've waited this long.
Alexander Payne's films insist upon themselves. They insist upon themselves. 2 1/2 stars for Hong Chau.
This film should of had a marquee with the headline ⭐️ Starring Hong Chau ⭐️  She delivered a spirited performance that gave me all the feels. Christopher Waltz and Udo Kier were like a modern day Statler and Waldorf, which was a playful addition to this cast. I love Alexander Payne movies but not my favorite.   Still not a fan of Matt Damon 🤷🏻‍♀️
Downsizing's ambitions are overshadowed by its own disinterest in fully exploring each fascinating "world-making" element it creates. A smart comedy and satire, which may have proven more digestible to audiences as a series, instead takes on the appearance of Honey I Shrunk the Kids without the adventure. Payne's dry and corny humor just doesn't seem to provide the colors to successfully paint a picture I would expect a lot of people want to see. Still there's a lot to enjoy here and I could see this receiving the same soft revaluation a comedy like Idiocracy is now having...once enough time passes.
Did they have to shave the dogs when they shrink them wtf
i’m upset this is as bad as it is. man, i deserved more. hong chau is the only saving grace.
this movie downsized in how interesting it was as it went on
Basically Honey, We Shrunk Ourselves but not fun
Well, that was deeply odd. Of interest.
Interesting concept, almost too close to reality. A bit difficult to follow though, mostly financially.
I...wanted to like this film. And I did, a 3/5 bit. The film initially delicately and meticulously handles the premise until it implodes into an environmental and existential commentary accompanied by some strange character arcs. The film loses its footing and seems to stumble over some unnecessary obstacles. Even as it descends into a mess, the film asks important questions which seem to be simply diluted towards the film's end.
Sorry for doubting you climate change, you were right. This dull ass movie proves that human beings should be wiped from the surface of the earth.
»When you know death comes soon, you look around things more close.« This movie did pretty well in the first half in my opinion, but after that I felt like the plot isn't going anywhere. I wish they would have shown more of the life of small people or the differences between small and normal people. I kept forgetting that they aren't normal size anymore, because everything is filmed in the perspective of the small people...
Downsizing is a perfect example of a movie that generally introduces a neat concept as well as providing a stellar cast making the characters relatable and genuine but the story falls short on almost all aspects. The first act of the entire film is the strongest element of the film as it explores the concept of a world where people are downsized in an effort to thwart humanity’s potential doomsday. Matt Damon plays a compelling protagonist as he has to adjust to the life changes of being downsized especially after it changes his life for the worse rather then the better. The film is a flop as it isn’t able to capitilize in its neat concept and instead focuses on a love/drama story of a man adjusting to a new way of life. The film could have gone in so many directions but falls on a flat note for its inability to use the concept it has presented to make a compelling genuine story. We are left to watch a typical movie that has been explored in so many other films. Overall rating 2.5/5 great concept and character performances but stale, uninteresting plot.
Maybe it was lowered expectations going in, but I surprisingly maybe liked this? However, I really hope that someday Payne will make a movie not centered around a white dude. It could have been so easy here to just swap roles and make Wiig the protagonist.
Goes downhill after a promising start but I've got a soft spot for tonally uneven films and this is all over the place. An interesting failure.
I... didn't hate it. The concept is fun even if the tone and plot is all over the place. It had good moments (primarily in the beginning) Do I thinkit would've been better with Rick Moranis in it? YES!!!!
Ah, Dowson grew up & is in a film. When they first entered the lobby "I'm in Heaven" was playing. I couldn't help but to smile. NPH was everything as the welcoming host who claimed to be an "average man". NPH is anything but average so why was he in this film? I was surprised small person rights were brought up so early in the film. Seeds planted-I get it yet nothing was brought up again... I was pleasantly surprised by the diversity it the processing room for Downsizing. Pre-Norway speech was so way over the top. Where did that come from? Beeep. Bloop. Such a small rock drop. It was hilarious and not disappointing as I expected it be just that.
the movie was pretty enjoyable & touching at a point but i forgot they were shrunken humans, the main purpose, for like half the movie the concept was good but executed so poorly
2 stars only for Christoph Waltz and Kristen Wiig
I understand the criticisms of this movie... They could have done something a lot more fun with a premise like this... But instead they went for a solemn meditation on class, race, humanity, and love, which I have to respect. The CGI is dodgy, and I wish they'd made the movie with practical effects, but I understand why they just went for it. I really dug the melancholy sadness of this, idk... Maybe its theme of big societal change promising a utopic, prosperous future that never materializes really resonated with me, a member of a generation raised amid... Exactly that. All the future opportunities for Hong Chau though, please!!
If you remember Superman II, the great hero loses his powers and we see him as a mere mortal. The same thing happened to Alexander Payne in 2017. A writer-director at the top of his game for years and years now, one of very few who can blend drama with comedy in such a life-life way. With Downsizing, the comedy and drama are quickly muddled, and there is, among other problems, no return in sight. Downsizing drifts off into a dark social climate that just does not engage.

This was good for like half an hour
not at all like the commercials, very serious
Viewed on Netflix All while keeping at a level of a slight notch above boredom, Alexander Payne's Downsizing (2017) is a roller coaster ride of a film. I went from enjoying it, to NOT enjoying it, to enjoying it again and finally NOT enjoying it again...and then the film ends. If you've seen any of the trailers... THEY ARE LYING TO YOU. This is easily Alexander Payne's worst film.
High concept that maybe could’ve benefited from... downsizing... on a few of its lofty ambitions.
Uh I’m tired of watching movies that have no plot until the last 10 minutes...
Wowwwww what a weird turkey. I wanted to see this even though everything I’ve heard about it has been very negative.  The first 45min was so good I was like “everybody’s an idiot, this is great!”  Then the movie keeps going and gets so weird and bad it’s almost unbelievable. This is a great concept for a movie and I wish they made a good version instead of whatever the hell this is.
Get this thing away from me
I need a word for "I felt like watching a movie but am lacking mental energy and generally not feeling great so I'm going to watch a movie that looks really dumb and I didn't think I'd ever watch but there is something about it that kind of intrigues me so I'll roll the dice," because I felt like watching a movie but was lacking mental energy and generally not feeling great so I picked a movie that looked really dumb and I didn't think I'd ever watch but there was something about it that kind of intrigued me so I rolled the dice.  This went from "this might not be as bad as it looked" to "whoa what happened none of this was in the trailer is this good?" to "wait no what the hell does this have to do with anything?"  Hong Chau gave this film most of its life. I also thought she was great in a small role in Amazon's series Homecoming, but otherwise am unfamiliar with her work.
It starts out making you think about shrinking your body for profit and for saving the planet. Not a bad sci-fi start. And along the way it raises some interesting questions about the end of humanity. But there are long stretches where it makes no sense at all.
was this a fever dream bc it cannot have been real
This movie started off with promise but ultimately fell flat. However there were things I liked about. Mostly Hong Chau. She was fantastic. Please cast her in more things. The honesty of her performance makes it worth the watch.
A placid normal guy who is used to monotony and is thrown some bad cards is the lead of this film. Interesting concept with a relatable perspective. I feel that the potential of this movie overall ends up fizzling for the most part as the direction you anticipate things going is continuously thrown out the window. As a film for the masses, I can envision most people disliking the dry comedy and uneven flow of this film, but I adore the concept, acting, and message that this film leaves. Get out in new, uncomfortable situations and see where life brings you and what you can bring on yourself. You never know.
what was the POINT    blu ray
if i can use one word to describe this movie i’d choose the word MEH
The best thing about the movie is also its most problematic.
An absolute trainwreck. But if you want to make great films you got to take a risk some times. I'm looking forward to Paynes next project. Let's leave it at that.
Where did all the small stuff get made... like the Furniture, cars, bikes? Why were raindrops not huge? Has Alexander Payne even seen ‘Honey I Shrunk The Kids’?!
Interesting, but it was diluted by trying to make too many statements. The point best-made was that people would downsize — shrink themselves — to permit them to live in “McMansions” and general excess.
An interesting idea that focuses less on the political, social, and economic affects the idea would have on the world for a story with less impact and keeping us (disappointingly) uninterested.
I almost passed on this one because of the reviews.  There is always the risk that bad science fiction can be really bad.  However, I am an easy sell on SciFi if you just go all in on the insanity and don’t try to make jokes around the already obviously ridiculous premise.  The comedy comes from the offbeat concept and characters that are pretty enjoyable to watch.
I'm very conflicted over this film. See, the only reason I'd want to save the world is I like my stuff and want to keep it around but if the solution to the worlds ills involves me leaving my stuff behind....?
The original idea wasn’t bad, hovewer, it could have been managed and explored differently to make it look interesting. Hong Chau's/Ngoc Lan Tran was the best thing of the movie tho, what a character !!!
I was digging through this with joy until the story's second act hits, Matt Damon gets drunk at a party and somehow the script jumps off the top of a pint-size building. What followed was an epic fight between me and the fast forward button.
matt damons character - boring plot - nonexistent? matt damon gets small and that's all that really matters direction - the safest possible execution why was this made
matt damon really shrank himself to 5 inches just to warn us about climate change and y’all still ain’t listening huh  also... comedy? ... i guess u can pop in one racial caricature and call it day...
I wasn't aware this movie had such mixed reviews, but I sorta understand why. I went in mostly blind (having not seen the trailer) and mostly enjoyed it.
Downhill
Ngoc Lan Tran is the highlight of this movie. I would watch this again solely for the purpose of getting my stomach tickled by her funny dialogues.
I give it credit for the fun special effects and the actors had a lot of fun. Otherwise, most of the movie just loved itself a little too long. And I believe my heartstrings could have been played more, so I was disappointed.
definition of meh
A movie that should only be watched on the plane when you have no better options.
There is a whole lot of things that you explore while you watch this movie, if you watch it sincerely. Matt Donavan has proved himself again on how good he tries to put the viewers in his place through his acting skills. Watching his emotions and reactions made me feel like I was reading what was going on in his mind. I presumed the movie to be of some kind before watching it and while I watched it move through all the bends and curves through its journey i realized how beautiful it is than what i imagined. The Sci-Fi movie which linked the techno advancement to the great global cause. Whenever you find yourself curiously moving along with the movie, Christoph Waltz(Dusan Mirkovic) will help you relive the tension on your forehead and put a smile on your face. There was this part which hit me hard while watching this film, global warming is a serious threat, you know what else is? The wonderfully designed, provided with great power and the freedom to choose and resolve actions may end up in nothing but vain, which of course what we humans brought on ourselves. However debating over this is whole other topic, but this movie will put you on some different perspective. Maybe I spoke a little out of the picture above but, hey, you asked for my review and this what i really felt and thought watching the movie. Yet I'm glad and enjoyed watching this movie.
I’m just glad to see Udo Kier is getting more work. I wanted to step on lil Matt Damon.
7.7/10, There's a few guys or girls that put together multiple trailers for this movie back in 2017. One trailer really got me pumped up and I was blown away by. I was the definition of sold by not only the concept but by the trailer. It was my most anticipated movie of 2017 and we had a Plant Hulk movie coming out. PLANT HULK! Then as I sat in a dimly lit theatre one evening the 2nd trailer appeared on the screen. I was in horror while watching this trailer. Never has there ever been a trailer (other than cast away) that spoiled so much of the film. I couldn't believe what I saw but it was right there infront of me. I decided not to see the movie based on that trailer. I knew how the film progressed and was really looking forward to seeing it play out as I actually watched the movie. I finally saw it today and it was really good! The potential for this to be an 8 or a 9 was there but disappointingly it was completely let go by the fucktards at Universals trailer cutting company. A year later and I'm still extremely extremely extremely disappointed in the cut of this trailer. Anyway, it's a fun movie that makes you think. Check it out.
I know most people didn't like this one and I expected a comedy too but when the film went a completely different direction I thought "This is much better". I felt that "Downsizing" is a warm-hearted movie with very likable characters in it especially Hong Chau as a Vietnamese dissident, who stole the show. I really enjoyed watching this a second time which I do very rarely.
This movie was all over the place, and not in a good way.
This movie was so forgettable that Moviepass doesn’t even have a poster for it on file anymore.
trailer: whimsical rom-com about a small man trying to find love in a new world uwu, hijinks ensue movie: commentary on human rights, capitalism, global warming????? and racist caricature???
The film opens with an astonishing scientific breakthrough when Swedish scientists discover how to shrink any living organism. Humans shrunk to such a size would massively reduce their impact on the environment. A few years later and the trend to 'Downsize' has become a phenomena as investing all full size worth into tiny resources means you can live a leisurely lifestyle. Married couple Paul and Audrey (Matt Damon and Kristen Wiig) elect to do this and set out for 'Leisureworld'. Upon arrival however things start to unravel for Paul and he ends up alone working another dead end job. His exuberant neighbour Dusan (Christoph Waltz) starts showing him another aspect of the world and he also meets Ngoc (Hong Chau) a Vietnamese woman who's approach to life is very different from his own. This film - a dark comedy - is something of a mess with lots of fascinating ideas - some of which are just left hanging without being explored - and characters ranging from the fascinating (Ngoc) to the wasted (Audrey). Viewers going in expecting a traditional sci-fi movie may be disappointed as the film meanders into reflections on the nature of existence and the quality of life versus quality of lifestyle. Director Alexander Payne seems unsure how to explore many of the issues he raises - leaving things open for debate is fine - but the debate needs to at least begin within the film. Audrey's character does something seemingly from out of left field and we never get to truly understand why. The biggest issue though is Matt Damon. Hopelessly miscast his selfless doormat is so out of character you keep waiting for him to react. A more comic actor could have mined the misfortunes that befall Paul for more laughs - with Damon we just cringe for him. So - interesting ideas go unexplored and half as funny as it should be.
Fun exploration of a concept, but that's also all it is.
I thought this was supposed to be about little people
what the fuck first half was so good but it just fell apart on the second half
they should have downsized the run time and focused in on a storyline cause wtf.
Alexander Payne's unfairly maligned Downsizing has the rare storyline that you could almost have a more satisfying time listening to someone describe than actually seeing executed. This has always been the filmmaker Payne has been. His most cohesive films have everything in common with this heady, meandering and benign film. It would have been a savory novel were it not for the lovely visual gimmick of how people re-imagine space and civilization at five inches tall. And Downsizing elevates its gimmick: Even if we scoff and laugh at it, we realize that the way things are going, it's no crazier an idea than anything else we could desperately concoct in an attempt to escape our irreversible environmental fate. The social make-up fo the world as microcosm is certainly intriguing, a dollhouse of all the world's indulgences and hardships in one Russian doll. While Downsizing is not without concern for the end of human life on earth, it faces the threat with little gravitas, and instead meditates wryly on what “the good life” may comprise, here and now. A change of perspective helps one to better grasp the world, and Downsizing makes it as straightforward as an allegory can be without losing its luster in the first act.
It's not awful. It's pleasantly whimsical to a point.
Hong Chau is a revelation in Alexander Payne’s thought-provoking and original "Downsizing."
2 Stars Best Performance: Matt Damon Scene Stealer: Christoph Waltz Score: 5/10 Worth Seeing in Theaters? No Rewatch Factor: 2/10 Additional Notes: It's a very interesting premise, but the movie takes sharp turns and leaves you wondering what just happened.
Downsizing, director Alexander Payne’s latest film, is an interesting beast in a strong body of work. Set in a near future, the narrative utilises the lofty concept of “downsizing”: the irreversible process of shrinking humans down to approximately five inches tall as means of combating overpopulation. Opening in a world where both normal and “downsized” people coexist, the film follows strapped-for-cash occupational therapist Paul Safranek (Matt Damon) who lives with his wife, Audrey (Kristen Wiig). They ponder the procedure after meeting a friend at a reunion party, who reveals other benefits – financial security, for one. To reveal any more would be a disservice to the film as this is what is sold in the marketing. However, Downsizing has a lot hidden up its sleeve, perhaps accounting for the film’s decidedly mixed reception. It’s actually a lot better than the reviews would suggest, and is a marvel in world-building. The settings that Payne creates are frequently awe-inspiring and the minutiae admirable, greatly elevating the verisimilitude of the film. That said, a tonal shift midway through does feel like a switch-and-bait. There is still enjoyment to be had in the slightly more familiar, “finding oneself ” narrative route Payne explores, even though its moral messages are delivered heavy-handedly. Downsizing balances comedy and emotion well, and is bolstered by being both thematically rich and chock-full of metaphors, right down to the very concept of the film itself, interrogating political and planetary notions. The performances are sound, the highlights being those of being Christoph Waltz and Udo Kier. To see both German-speaking stalwarts share the screen is very satisfying. Downsizing is a commendable effort by Alexander Payne, with transfixing worldbuilding, but it requires one to have faith in the tonal shift in its second half. The first half is much stronger, but the direction it takes thereafter is probably why many have taken quite sourly to the film: you don’t exactly get what the trailers promised.

So I stopped watching this with about an hour left just because it was so bad. It just seemed to go on forever. The whole shrinking concept was all right and made the first half hour or so decent but then after about 45 minutes it seems they just forgot about the whole concept and just changed the whole movie into a boring movie in which nothing really happened.  Don’t waste your time watching this rubbish.
Alexander Payne, a humanistic filmmaker, is clearly interested in getting "ordinary folk" on camera. Hence the main part of Leisureland being populated by movie stars like Laura Dern and Neil Patrick Harris, and the outskirts being populated by unknown performers and non-actors.
The idea is vert sick! The beginning is good. But what is happening at the end of the movie? I’m soo confused..
interesting idea, mediocre film with a couple of slightly intriguing situations and (cheap) laughs.
Small Matt Damon made me want to throw up
What’s baffling is that the scientist who discovered downsizing used powerpoint-default font Calibri for his big announcement. Weird movie but with a good heart. I think Hong Chau nailed the very hard Vietnamese accent. The trailers ruined this since it kinda sold the movie as a social satire but it’s mostly not. Not what we’re expecting anyway especially after that turn to the beginning of the apocalypse.
If you wanna help the earth, ya better start with your neighbors. Every man for themselves, sure, but.. there’s no harm in giving the old homeless man some chicken once in a while.. ya know?
went from interesting to whats the point to sooo boring, if you are gonna make a point to this movie about environmental change, stick to it and make it clear instead of changing scenarios so fast
50 I am not sure what to make of this movie. I really didn't see the point in the plot at times. This had some good moments, but overall was disappointing considering it had potential to be much better.
The beginning was good for like 20 minutes?
Still uncapable to decide if I liked Downsizing and the idea that stands behind its realization or not. I watched it mainly because there was Christoph Waltz, but his role is not that central. Probably the main character was so weak that you are not interested in what happens to him, so you are not interested in what happens in general to the film. Even when people are preparing for saving the human race by undertaking an 8.000 year trip under a mountain, you don't get to think: "wow, how cool is that". No, and that's really a major issue. So well, probably I didn't like the movie, and maybe not even the idea that stands behind it.
Maybe I overhyped it in my head but this film just felt small.
I was just thinking about it and like Fuck downsizing! I wanted Honey I Shrunk the Matt Damon but what I got was a bad environmental film that's as heavy handed as a real hand in comparison to a small person. Which is to say very heavy. it Alexander Pains me to say this but it's a mess don't do it
Well, there is an asian woman who speaks broken englisch. VERY FUNNY.
I really enjoyed this movie 😊
A subtle mix of props and FX sell the visuals, a meticulous prologue sells the concept, and a midlife crisis plot divided the audience. Very much an Alexander Payne film.
very thought provoking.
Downsizing does a very good job at establishing its premise but once Damon's character is shrunk in size, it has no idea what to do with itself. Any statements about the fragility of humility are undercut by an aggressively annoying supporting cast.
The reason they became small is for a scientific and logistic purposeful reason and I was kinda dissapointed they aren't any fun Honey I Shrunk the Kids moments and they barely toy with the gimmick. me and my friends tried to sneak in to watch another movie for free after watching a movie in cinemas (Along With The Gods) cause the damn ticket was expensive and we were pissed off and we want our money worth and the plan was to wait in the toilet for a bit and just go to a movie hall so we tried that and the first hall is Maze Runner:Death Cure and we decided that it sucked so we went to another hall that showed Downsinzing.it was settled me and my bud would sit at the back and my 3rd friend would sit in the empty row in the front. So we got in,sat down,one of my buds ran down the stairs to the front and immediatly the guy sitting in front immediatly noticed us with a weird look on his face. I was nervous that we might got caught but then I saw my buddy that was supposed to be at the front ran up the hall stairs and I looked back at the screen and the credits rolled. we panicked and got the hell outta there.Good experience. So the only the only thing I knew before I watched the movie was the trailer,A couple of mean spirited reviews youtube comments and the last 30 sec of the ending and gotta say the trailer made it look exciting but it is not,the youtube comment reviews were stupid and the ending stinks cause like it is just too sudden. if this story is retold in a simpler way even without the shrinking gimmick its still a good story. I'm hugely dissapointed that they wasted Kristenn Wigg like that like c'mon Kristen make Hollywood make you a fuckin movie that will immortalise you already that being said though Ngoc Lan is a standout,she is a really is a great strong interisting character.
No.  The whole Downsizing thing is a great idea but the story they told ruined it.
Downsizing – 3.5/10 I have never seen a movie fall off a cliff this badly. After a very promising first hour it completely nose dived and quickly became irritating. After all of the detail they put into building the world, it’s baffling that they didn’t follow up on any of it. There is a great scene in a bar where a ‘regular’ sized person starts spewing abuse at the ‘downsizers’ as they no longer contribute top the economy. That’s your movie right there. Focus on that dynamic and make it a satire. Instead they introduce one of the most misjudged characters of the year; the Vietnamese cleaning lady. Hong Chau is a golden globe nominate actor, but I found her character shrill, slightly racist and more annoying than Jar-Jar Binx. The fact that she becomes Matt Damon’s love interest just doesn’t sit right at all. This is a squandered opportunity at exploring a relevant and interesting topic. It’s off-beat quirkiness just comes across as try-hard and unfunny.
The film starts interesting into building a world of the downsized people. It's fun to see how they interact with the normal world and how they fit in it. The actor are also doing a pretty good job. Matt Damon and Hong Chau work great together and are fun to watch. So it is even sader that the story around Matt Damons character is a bit lame. In the last thrid of the film in the Norway the film is just plain boring. I had no emotional attachment to the the norwegian Community. I didn't care about anything about the whole save bunker and coming up mankind catastrophe. "Downsizing" would have much more better if Alexander Payne just focused more on the effects of the Downsizing to the world. Impacts in the politics, the eccomomy and the society are mostly teased here. The focus should have been definitly here.
In terms of quality, Alexander Payne has been downsizing since his early film - Election, a wonderfully witty dissection of intra-school politics and relationships, which worked perfectly as a wider metaphor for power dynamics in general. Since then, his films have become increasingly less convincing, none more so than Downsizing. The idea was a clever one and rich with comic potential and satirical opportunities. Few are realised. Thank god, for Christoph Waltz, the best thing in the film by a proverbial mile. And as for Damon's relationship with a one-legged cleaner, who dreamed that idea up? It was ludicrous in the extreme. It didn't help that the mono-ped was so unbearably annoying, I had nightmarish visions of ripping off her wooden leg and beating her over the head with it. In the end, Downsizing was like its protagonist, well-meaning but fairly dull.
A bit stretched out, some interesting plot points skipped, but quite sweet? An easy Sunday watch
