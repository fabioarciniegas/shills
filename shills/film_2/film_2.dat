Disappointingly stupid in every level! Just have one question. harley quinn maybe cray cray but how the hell did she survive that fight without damaging her ass or getting stuff suck there!??
i could have written, directed and acted on the same level as them
This is the first and only time I've ever audibly boo'd a film as I watched it in a theater.
If I never think about this film again I’ll be satisfied. Not happy. True happiness could only be achieved if someone erased this film from my mind and the face of the planet simultaneously.
Is it as bad as you heard it was? Yeah, pretty much. Random scenes that add up to nothing, boring plot, mediocre action, indistinguishable characters with zero depth, suffocatingly obvious music choices from start to finish and cringeworthy humour and one-liners. Viola Davis and Margot Robbie were the only entertaining parts about this whole sorry affair.
It was boring. The first hour there was no plot at all... And the movie lasts for over 2h The movie drags on.

With all those announced and postponed dceu films coming out and how complicated it is they should just scrap it all and make only Captain Boomerang films
Irrational plot
I heard terrible terrible things about this. The reality somehow still was below my expectations. Here is a list of random thoughts I had about this film. The order is more or less as well though out and comprehensible as the plot of the film. - In the opening shot, the black text at the bottom of the screen establishing the location slides over a patch of black/brown ground and immediately is unreadable. The editing in general is so incomprehensible that you can't really understand it until you see it. - Whoever has the power to ban Jared Leto from life, can they please do so. He occasionally barges into the plot for no apparent reason. At one point he lies on the ground surrounded by various weapons and children's clothing. LOL SO RANDOM... He seems to be doing a bad heath ledger impersonation which has the side effect of making him incomprehensible at points. Possibly this inadvertently improves the film - It takes about 40 minutes, nearly a third of the runtime, just on the opening exposition dump and setting up the members/plot. It could pretty much have started 40 minutes in and nothing changes. - The suicide squad helicopter gets shot down by gunfire, but I cannot for the life of me work out who did it. I think enchantress and her brother were the only people who were threats in the city at the time, who don't use guns. Whoever did it seems to just vanish into the night. - During a firefight, someone seems to be firing a laser gun. Who has this, how and why I cannot work out. Its bizzare. It shows up at various other times as well but you can never see where it comes from. Later some random person in a helicopter uses a laser gatling thing - a helicopter which definitely wasn't there any other time. -Conceptually the entire thing is stupid right off the bat. For some inexplicable reason, the government decides that to assemble a squad that can take on superman if he turned evil, or another similar threat occurred. They then filled this squad almost entirely of regular human people. Unless superman has a crippling fear of boomerangs, I doubt they'll go far. Katana is probably the one character who's actually pretty cool. She has a handful of lines, some of which are in Japanese and underrated. This is a criminal misuse of a character whose sword sucks in the souls of people she kills. Criminal. - People seem to just do random things in this film for no apparent reason. - At least killer Croc has a positive body image about himself? Yay? - This wants to be guardians of the galaxy so hard. El Diablo has a line about them being a family which is SO unearned. - The effect of Dr Moon's hand flipping to enchantress' hand was good. There are occasional other nice effects around her, like when she reaches out of the mirror. In conclusion: suicide squad bad; #rehirejamesgunn4suicidesquad2; katana solo film please.
i'm baffled that anyone thought this was good
Rating this with 1 star is being too much generous? This is a DC stan asking.
this is just a two hour long commercial for hot topic
After two years I've finally seen it... It was pure, unadulterated trash. It felt to me like a big huge gigant trailer compilation, and the only thing that I liked was Margot Robbie, cause she is beautiful and charismatic and I wish she to kidnap me and torture me in a weirdly fetichistic yet kind and nurturing way.
Arguably one of the worst films of all time. I will never forget the uncomfortable 2 hours and 17 minutes of silence in the full cinema as I was forced to witness this abomination of a 'film' with my own two eyes.
This was honestly one of the worst movies I've seen. Certainly the worst superhero movie. The only redeeming things have been some cool Will Smith scenes and the perfectly cast Margot Robbie (hey, I don't blame her for the bad writing). Other than that it was an atrocious mess. Cringy dialogue, some really bad acting (especially by Delevingne and Kinnaman), the worst iteration of the Joker I've seen to date (to be fair to Leto, I understand a lot of his scenes have been cut - but I can only judge what I can see) and a horrible plot. I mean, come on - everything can be handled with bombs? Antique God? Just blow him up. Some weird magical weapon destined to destroy the earth? Just blow it up. Ridiculous. At the end of the movie I definitely wanted to join the Suicide Squad by killing myself.
the only three good thingd about this movie was viola davis, margot robbie and the soundtrack. now i see we didn't need more than the trailer itself.
Better then expected. Better (darker) then the avengers except infinity war.
Suicide Squad Review 44 DCEU catch up before Aquaman part 3. After Man if Steel I was really hopeful that the rest of the movies would be just as good if not better. Let’s just say I was disappointed. I liked how this movie was setting up but its execution was very poor. It was entertaining most of the way through but its plot and some of the silly moments took away from it heavily. Also again questioning how many innocent people died... abuse again it’s a lot. Batman V Superman is next, I’m still hopeful.
it wasn’t that good but also i was removed from the theater for a solid 20 minutes.
heath ledger rose from the grave to slice jared leto’s kneecaps over this
At least whenever the next Joker comes around, people won't have to compare him to the impossibly high standard of Heath Ledger. Now they can compare it to the impossibly low standard of Jared Leto!!
Oof. Suicide Squad is okay, kind of fun, but could have been much better. I wanted to like it! My body was ready. I wanted the whole movie to be like the opening 20 minutes, the closing credits, and the poster. It felt like it wanted to be Deadpool, more or less. That would have been great! So would a version directed by, say, Justin Lin. It's got its moments, but nowhere near enough of them.﻿
Can anyone honestly tell me what this on fire carnival is about?
The script wasn't that good (a lot of dialogue, especially from Smith and Robbie, is really choppy and forced in for no real reason). There were also a few dumb scenes, such as Harley commiting a THEFT right in front of a MILITARY OFFICER. The pacing was kind of off at the beginning, with like 10 whole minutes giving all the characters (except Slipknot) hype videos as if it was a Smash Bros Game. Killer Croc's character would have been better off not speaking at all. I couldn't understand a word he said. Also, how come NONE of the good metahumans out there took any interest in what was going on? Alright, now for the good stuff. First, the whole premise is actually very interesting. I'm usually not a big fan of movies with a villain as the protagonist, especially superhero movies, because they're always going to "turn good" and be redeemed, which is the opposite of the point of having villains. But they change it up here. Instead of fighting the bad guy, they're being forced by THE GOVERNMENT to do it. Even if characters like Harley and El Diablo had "redeeming moments", they still remain bad guys, and are still thought of by the public as villains. DC doesn't get enough credit for having more original stories. Second, the characters are interesting. The ones that are important to the story (so, everyone but Slipknot) is given just enough backstory to allow the audience to understand and feel for the characters, while still thinking of them as "bad guys". Third, the action. Seeing bad guys fight faceless CGI army men for a good cause, while still being bad guys is an awesome thing to see. The effects and makeup were very good (even Oscar-worthy). Also, I loved how they added in cameos from Batman and the Flash, (whom this was his first real appearance on screen). It didn't feel shoehorned in. Finally, I don't understand the hate that Jared Leto's Joker gets. Yeah, his performance isn't as good as Ledger's but you'll never get him back (RIP). Get over it. Leto's performance isn't bad. It's actually quite good for what it is. What is it?, you may ask. Well, Nicholson's Joker was basically a mob-boss who had a few screws loose, but still had his wits. Ledger's Joker was a full-on psycho who THOUGHT he was perfectly sane. (I'm not even gonna mention Romero). I like to think that Leto is playing a mix between the two. He's definitely a mob boss, and he knows exactly what he's doing, but he's also has a very messed up head. I think the film would have benefited greatly from more of him. I hope they do more with him in the future. Oh, and I think the film should have taken place at Arkham Aylum. You've got big, well-known villains like Harley Quinn, Killer Croc, and Deadshot being kept at a PENITENTIARY instead of an INSANSE ASYLUM. So yeah. It's not perfect, but it's enjoyable. I don't think it was ever supposed to be a "good" film, but it does NOT deserve all the hate it gets.
1st Watch
Se Guardians of the Galaxy istället.
A mess story and pacing-wise, but all the main actors were on fleek
one star because of Jared Leto/ edited : 17h48 : lemme take back what i said i don’t support any abuser bye
Imagine a turd. Also imagine that turd if it had a talking crocodile who ate fried chicken, went to jail, and watched BET.
There was a movie somewhere in that mess, Robbie was awesome, Leto ok, awkwardly moralistic, structurally munted, pretty fun!
Loved the soundtrack. Harley Quinn was cool but Jared Leto as the joker was not my favorite.
Bright colors and Margot Robbie spreading her butt-cheeks isn't going to distract me from how horrendous this movie is.
HEY EVERYBODY IT’S HOT TOPIC CLEARANCE RACK: THE MOVIE! Listen to me and the wonderful Megan Holiday talk a whole bunch of shit about this cinematic failure on our episode of Blockbusting.
More boring than I would have believed possible.
Sally annoyed my fin gutbags so much during this film that it was hard to enjoy it. Love Yoda (The Loveable P G even) Typed by Lewy
This is the third time I’ve watched Suicide Squad, and I enjoyed it more this time than I did the last two times. The main characters are all likeable, and the story is really good. I always really enjoy the part where they introduce the members of the Suicide Squad. The soundtrack is also mostly really good. Any soundtrack that has Queen and Kanye West is going to be awesome. One thing I was thinking about while watching this was that I really like the CGI in the DCEU films. It has a kind of unique style that I really like, and it looks a lot more interesting than the CGI in most other superhero films. Anyway, I would like to see more of these characters in the future, and I think Jared Leto would be a really great Joker with more screen time.
yes. What
will and margot
Joker and Harley are so cute omg 😍😍
two stars one for deadshot and another for harley
I really wanted to like this movie but the plot was just soooo bad.
What is this, some kinda movie review?
Suicide is no joke this hole movie was really inconsiderate. 0/10,64
I couldn't finish this. I don't know how this was released.
So bad it’s not worth my time to write about.
I wanted to love it so much, one of the best trailers I’ve ever seen, but movie had the most non sensical plot I’ve ever seen from a AAA production.
It starts to grow on me.
What a shame, this could've been the breaking off point for the DCEU, a cool premise, with usually charming characters, I was actually excited for this film, then I saw set photos, I was a little disappointed, but still excited, then the movie came out and, well, shit. Will Smith is a lot of fun and sympathetic as Deadshot, Margot Robbie is good a Harley Quinn, Jai Courtney's best performance (as sad as that statement is), and they brought in Katana, a badass character, who looks cool... And they barely ever show her. Jared Leto as the Joker is very forgettable, even if he was the main villain, his performance was severely lacking. As for the main villain, I don't remember a thing about her, except for the belly dances from Hell.
Nope. Not a fan.
My school voted this the best film of 2016 and I've now fully lost faith in the youth of today.
this movie caused the “nOrMAL iS A sEtTING oN a dRYER!!” quote to go viral and for that I can’t enjoy it.
Has to be one of the worst movies I’ve ever seen. An absolute joyless mess.
every bad idea ever was put into this film
This is a so bad it's good movie for me, My friend caught this movie and laughed almost all the way through the movie. There are so many terrible lines that are very quotable. The effects are laughable at times, characters are written and preformed so astonishingly bad that you have no option but to laugh at the movie. The movie as a whole makes no sense, why would you hire dangerous and unstable criminals with very little to no superpowers to save the world. Where are the superheros that are in this universe. This is a world ending event. We see batman twice during the movie but not near the end when the world is actually moments away from ending. It's a genuinely fantastic time, and a must watch if you find overwhelmingly incompetent film making to be funny.
Back in 1987, DC Comics started publishing Suicide Squad by John Ostrander and Luke McDonnell. Ostrander's brilliant premise was this: in a world of independent, potentially dangerous people and aliens with powers far beyond those of mortal men, the American government found itself in need of a covert task force of equally super-powered people to counter the perceived threat. Government agent Amanda Waller - one of the great creations of modern comics - recruits a team of so-called super-villains into Task Force X, offering them time off their prison sentences in exchange for engaging in suicide missions for the government. They really have little choice, because Waller has implanted bombs in their necks that can be set off remotely if the villains try to escape or otherwise disobey. Colloquially, they're known as the Suicide Squad, since the odds of coming back from any given mission are slim. This paranoid, cynical premise is a perfect reflection of the late cold war era, and Ostrander played on the tropes of the time brilliantly, giving the villainous characters depth rivaling and even surpassing DC's more famous protagonists - Batman, Wonder Woman, Superman and all the rest. During the course of the series one-note villains such as the ludicrous Captain Boomerang or the deeply damaged Deadshot are given new dimensions; as I reader, I found myself sympathizing with them even on those occasions when they were put into conflict with the mainstream heroes. Over the course of five years and 63 issues, Ostrander and his team delivered engaging, morally ambiguous stories rich with drama, action and character development, while also offering wry commentary on the politics of the day. When I heard that Suicide Squad was to be adapted to film, I was equal parts excited and wary. Summer blockbusters are not the ideal venue to explore the more subtle aspects of Ostrander's original comic; it would be all to easy to simply skim off the surface of the work - the action and some character beats - throw them into a few chase and fight sequences and call it a day. And indeed, that's exactly what's happened with David Ayer's big screen Suicide Squad. The film is front-loaded with exposition, it's too dark - not in tone, but visually - and the villain is a one-note mystical force when what this film needed was a more grounded first mission. To a degree, I enjoyed the treatment of the Squad members: assassin Deadshot, petty crook Captain Boomerang, the deranged clown princess of crime, Harley Quinn, the monstrous, mutated Killer Croc, the witch-possessed Enchantress, the ex-gang banger El Diablo, and their government overseers, Colonel Rick Flag and Katana, who wields a sword that steals the souls of those it kills. Of course this reads as somewhat ridiculous, but part of enjoying this genre is accepting that the world of superheroics includes all manner of wondrous and bizarre properties. What makes the film work (to the limited extent that it does) is the way these characters interact with each other and how they respond to the situation Amanda Waller and the government have imposed upon them. They are, to say the least, reluctant heroes, and the antagonistic griping slung back and forth is one of the small delights of the film. The other is the way in which the backstories of several of the characters are revealed, particularly Deadshot, Harley Quinn and El Diablo. Each has his or her own dreams and fears, some realized, some not by the movie's end. The mission itself is simple and linear: the squad has to fight its way through horde of monsters to first rescue an important figure trapped in the fray, and then to take out the threat itself. While not nearly as well done as similar sequences in Dredd or The Raid: Redemption, the combination of action and character interplay keeps the film moderately entertaining, and the final showdown itself is well-executed, has some emotional weight, and even lives up to the title in ways I won't spoil. The film also benefits from a great soundtrack and a neon purple-green colour palette that should have been used for more than the opening exposition sequences and the opening and closing credits; they give the film a very distinctive look during the sections where it's used, and could have livened up the (literally) darker sections of the movie. The cameos from other DC characters feel unforced and natural, organic to the story, another plus. Unfortunately, while Jared Leto gives his all as the Joker, his interpretation just doesn't work. It's possible that I'm being too easy on the film, given that it comes in the wake of the truly awful Batman v. Superman: Dawn of Justice. But for the first time after watching one of the modern DC movies, I actually want to see more of these characters and their world. Finally, the mid-credits sequence drops a very tantalizing possibility, one I hope a competent filmmaker realizes. Suicide Squad is by no means a great movie, but it has a goofy charm thanks primarily to the charisma and pain of its core characters. Given a little polish and extra time in the editing room, it may have almost lived up to the comic itself. It doesn't reach that point - it doesn't really come close - but Suicide Squad (the film), deserves credit for ambition, if nothing else, and for showing the humanity in monsters and the monsters in humanity.
Two hours of my life that will never go back.
Fascinatingly awful. The first hour of this feels like fifty online only shorts played in random order, at least five of which are called 'Meet Deadshot!' and none of which contain anything of value or interest - I genuinely don't think an editor saw the final cut before it went out. The soundtrack cues feel like the result of absolutely minimal thought and infinite budget. Margot Robbie's great but only in a way that cuts well for trailers, because the script's intense, feverish loathing for women won't allow her anything to actually do, and her relationship with Jared Leto (who is absolutely, inexcusably awful) is somehow even more irresponsibly portrayed than I expected. The cast all deserve some credit, but barely get to do more than pose, bark milquetoast background dialogue and, if they're lucky, deliver a confusing and uninteresting expositional monologue. There's a stretch at the beginning of the third act where the action slows down, becomes linear and feels like a film - not a great one, but a film nonetheless. The endless parade of reshoots, re-cuts and nigh-on rebrands are never more obvious than at this point where, you have to assume, you're seeing the longest remaining stretch of the first cut. Of all the films coke-and-market-researched to death of the last few decades, this might be the most blatant act of self-immolation. In the end, the funniest part, by far, is that David Ayer still ended up with a sole writing credit.
What a fucking mess. I don’t even know where to begin honestly. The acting wasn’t great, the plot was sub par at most, and the movie feels like its 20 minutes long. But, the makeup was pretty good so thats cool
I'm in love with Harley Quinn
We don't talk about this.
I did actually spend money on a movie ticket for this one
It was fun and thats all i wanted. I cant wait for margot robbie to take control of the dc universe.
Mediocre acting, awful editing, laughable dialogues and Slipknot... "The man who can climb anything"
And here I thought that a supervillain action flick might fare better than a superhero one. My bad. This seemed desperate to be badass, but also wanted to be some dark fairytale with witches and demons and magic? '•_•' Man, fuck this shit. I'm going back to real movies for a while.
Margot Robbie slays but this movie is still a fucking mess.
Review attached here: moviesshouldbegood.tumblr.com/post/149585521259/suicide-squad-review-by-nathan At the time of reviewing, I thought it was ok. This got much, much worse as more time passed on.
2 Stars Best Performance: Will Smith Scene Stealer: Jay Hernandez Score/Soundtrack: 7/10 Worth Seeing in Theaters? Surprisingly, yes, but tread lightly Rewatch Factor: 4/10 Additional Notes: Worst of the DC movies, and just a freakin mess. Awful plot, awful villains, poor acting. It's just a bad movie.
Oh god... This is a TOTAL mess, I mean, who edited this thing? So I haven’t seen this movie since its release, and at that time I thought it wasn’t that bad, I was wrong back then. However there are a few points in this movie that I actually kind of enjoy.
"Y'all jokers must be crazy." - Deadshot, - DCU Rankings: boxd.it/2a2kw What a confusing mess this film turned out to be. I feel like I just watched the two hour long trailer for a nine hour long movie.
Seen in this so-much needed time of mindless entertainment, I think it deserves some words, and not only because I'm quickly discovering myself as a DC fanboy. To write a defense about it is a hard task, since the movie is guilty of all the sins which are commonly acknowledged. It has a messy script, the most decipherable element with a judgement practiced and biased by tv shows, and it doesn't pander to critics and audience with trending themes and pop-culture references. I’ve always thought that the script in the end is the most expendable element in a film, so I can easily pass on that, even if its defects drag along similar problems in direction and editing. But in the there are three elements that pretty much make amends for everything else, making Suicide Squad a pretty enjoyable flick with a high entertainment value. The first one is the anarchy of its mise en-scene. Unfortunately it is merely the lucky result of a troubled set and a confused direction, where the editing department was left with the most difficult part of the job. Nevertheless its asymmetrical construction and confused development match the silliness of its protagonists. The rhythm is incredibly fast, there are no weak moments until the very end. And for last, the cast. It is a perfect example of how a good casting can save a bad film. In this case, everything is carried on Will Smith and Margot Robbie’s shoulders. It is one of the few things Ayer got right (or -better- where the production didn’t interfere), deciding to focus the film on them. Smith is a renowned star, and has made a career out of saving shitty movies with just his presence; of course he was the perfect choice for Deadshot. So was Margot Robbie for Harley Quinn; it was her breakout performance, launching her in what will be an extraordinary career.
One of the worst movies of all time? I mean....
i don't even want to imagine how bad this would be if margot robbie wasn't in it.
Short n' sweet: For an actual Suicide Squad film, watch this as an alternative. Dumpster fire not even worth talking about.
This is a movie that fails on just about every conceivable level. All the rumours you hear about the nightmarish production and release, it doesn't matter, all the evidence you need is on the screen. Cringey dialogue, choppy editing and pacing, revolting amounts of needless exposition, action and plot progression akin to that of a kid playing with his action men. This film is a masterpiece of failure that lacks so much identity and focus that it's doesn't even have a story. We never actually grasp what the point to anything is. Why are they even brought together in the first place? You'd at least expect the reason to be something that forces the governments hand, but actually, the evil force they end up fighting only comes about through the incompetence of the idea in the first place. Then there's the painting you're trying to sell to the audience. What are we trying to learn from the bringing together of these characters? Even bad people can come together and fight for redeemable things? Even bad guys are fighting for something? You can control bad guys to do what you want? They actually just bring all three of these together, and it's a disaster. All of these characters become something we're supposed to feel sympathy for. But they also continously do things randomly as if they keep forgetting these guys are meant to be villains. Plus, CONTINOUSLY, despite insisting otherwise, the Suicide Squad goes against their handlers and fuck with them with no consequence. There's no consistency, no real hook established, none of the characters are convincing or redeemable. It sucks. The twenty fucking minute long introduction to each and every character was one of the most incompetent filmmaking decisions I've seen from a Hollywood production. Twenty minutes. With each character getting 4-5 flashback scenes. All the while, Viola Davis is just sat at a table reading the synopsis for each fucking character. Excruciating, but at least they're giving some thought for that 99% of DC fans. aka the clinically diagnosed doorknobs. The only reason this isn't lower is, usually I'd reserve half a star for films I found to be insulting or revolting in some way. It's somewhat insulting intellectually, just not enough for me to consider it worthless. Plus, it gets an extra half star for having some 'okay' performances. Margot Robbie was a servicable Harley Quinn. Will Smith didn't do THAT bad. I'd also say, to protect David Ayer a little bit. This is a total studio disaster. I don't think much of this can be put onto his shoulders. If this film wasn't given to the studio that edited the trailer, maybe they could have at least salvaged this film to becoming passable.
This is borderline experimental.
A higher degree of bobbins than you find in most films of its ilk, but at least it didn't bore / annoy me like BvS / JL.
Fuck this movie.
I thought this was a Marvel movie (oeps)
Suicide Squad had me going nearly the entire movie. It's full of missed opportunities and wacky shit. Diablo was cool, Will Smith is always cool, and Harley Quinn stole the show. From Will Smith. She stole the show from Will Smith.
This film could’ve tackled much more material, much of what they were missing. It was a mess from the very beginning. That’s not necessarily saying it was god awful but sure as hell isn’t eveyone’s favorite. I like the vision that the director was going for but I feel like he was confused as to if he wanted to make it dark as fuck or simply a comedic event from minute one to the final minute. It’s gotta be one or the other and he didn’t know. As for the characters, alright .....um, what the fuck or what the FUCK? Harley? He got it right with choosing Margot Robbie, she gave the character a sassy yet “not giving a fuck” attitude which fit well. The tone of it all. As for the rest, eh, I mean, they tried I guess? Except I can’t judge Leto’s joker, mainly because he didn’t have lots of screen time which is understandable because of the fact that he ...isn’t apart of this story in particular. Nonetheless, this film needs its help. Lots of it.
Messy film has the quality of a trailer. The cinematography tries too hard to boast a crazy antihero flick feel and ends up failing. It’s only strength is in its characters.
Lol what?
“What are we? Some kind of Suicide Squad?”
Pulled from Twitter: Revisiting it again HANDS DOWN the worst DCEU film. Aside from some decent performances, this film leaves an ugly after-taste. But for archival purposes here is my OG review: #SuicideSquad is not as abysmal as the reviews suggest. BUT... it ain't good. Definitely a big disappointment. The 1st act when we're introduced to all the characters I thought was going fine. I surprisingly liked Will Smith as Deadshot. In fact the cast all around (except ONE guy in which we'll get to) is pretty spot on in their roles. @MargotRobbie oozes charisma. One last positive I'll say is that despite the VERY bad editing, the movie didn't indulge itself in a 2 & 1/2 hour runtime like BvS did. Now.... let's talk about the bullshit. Firstly, Jared Leto SUCKED as the Joker. Easily the worst interpretation I've seen to date. So the much hyped BTS drama the actor stirred led to a performance that's on par with Eddie Redmayne from Jupiter Ascending. I'll go more into the Joker himself later but needless to say this is an insult to Mark Hamill, Heath Ledger, Jack Nicholson, & Cesar Romero The REAL villains of the film are some of the worst I've seen to date. And that's saying A LOT b/c we just had Lex & Doomsday from BvS. Amanda Waller wants to combat Metahumans with other Metahumans. But aside from Diablo, NONE of them have actual superpowers. -____- The threat that was faced in this movie didn't lend towards the needs of non-powered villains. Batman & Wonder Woman could do it for you. There's a REALLY good animated DC film called #BatmanAssaultOnArkham which is what the live-action Suicide Squad film should have been. I mention this movie b/c it highlights the BIGGEST problem with David Ayer's film. The development of the Squad characters themselves In Assault on Arkham they are villains through & through. It's only b/c of Amanda Waller the Squad BARELY get along & do a good deed. In Ayer's film, they are made to be more sympathetic & even have a comradery which defeats the whole purpose of this concept of VILLAINS.
harley quinn saved this movie
I've certainly seen worse movies but I guess if Warner wants to spend $175,000,000 on a bunch of licensed songs they can. I hated Will Smith in this movie. Also nothing fucking happened in the entire movie. I'd say it was anti-climactic but it was anti-rising actionic. The whole movie was exposition and then they kinda just killed some monster. Wish I knew the motivations of the leader woman because she's shady and just randomly shot some FBI dudes???? Whatever, man. Also where was the Bohemian Rhapsody car scene from the trailer??? Did they just cut everything from this movie out? 2.5/5 Probably never going to watch more than the first half hour of this movie again.
Mostly good characters, great OST, but lame villain and plot. Maybe a good sequel?
Yet another example of a studio not knowing what they want there movie to be. All the best moments are in the trailers, and half don't make it to the final cut! The narrative is incredibly choppy, the tone(s) feels extremely messy, the scenes mix like water and vinegar, and themes like honor among thieves or the levels of villainy are never explored beyond face value. Going back and changing your mind is fine when you're planning an outfit, but not for making a movie. To be fair, some of the characters are able to do their comic source's justice despite limited screen time. Of course Smith is pretty much doing his usual thing but with a bit more sass, but he's always enjoyable. Robbie, Courtney, Hernandez and especially Davis truly brought their characters from the comics to the screen seamlessly, whereas Leto deserves all the flack he gets for that awful turn as The Joker.
there are so many good actors in this movie. every time I saw one I was like "why are you doing this". also can we stop romanticising abuse ty
very funny but not intentionally
