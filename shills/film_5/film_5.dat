This is hailed as the best film of all time for a good reason. Al Pachino is great in this, but where was Marlon Brando? Isn’t he on the cover?
Fixed the toilet issue. Good movie as well. But the sink’s missing a tap
one of the best commercial movies in malayalam, must watch
For the so called "best movie of all time" it was pretty bad.
The iconic theme song,memorable performances still makes it a pleasure to watch!
One of the finest entertainers Malayalam ever had.
