Do not be thrown by the glorious, dizzying kitsch of the film, this is a very complex portrait of a woman but also the social structures surrounding this woman (and most women). Biller is one of those directors like Todd Haynes where I am in love with the craft of their filmmaking, but also feel like I could write a long dissertation of the ideas and themes of the movie.
dvd, overall unsettling rating: 4/5  She's one of the best!
Viva has that same magical appeal of finding a time capsule, but instead of just finding things from the past this film interjects it’s own agenda and it’s great.  The film follows Biller as the lead Viva who is a young woman that wants more out of life then just her overly occupied husband and her circuit of friends that she rapidly grows bored of.  Once she leaves her husband Viva falls prey of all the strange flower children that are balls deep in the sexual revolution.  Biller displays an insanely vast amount of detail in every scene, the costumes look great, the home decor is straight from this era, and the one piece that really got me was the hairstyles.  Really great all around.
Checked this out as really enjoyed The Love Witch last year. Really liked it, even if the clearly low-budget means there are parts that are a little clunky. Biller is great and looking forward to what she does next, hopefully won't be as big a gap between her second and third.
I'm not smart enough for this movie.
Some scenes, I laugh out loud. Other scenes evoke a deep dread or discomfort. Anna Biller is a genius. It’s exciting to see this directorial debut, predating her masterpiece, THE LOVE WITCH.
This is the problem with trying to be hip. You take the titles from the Mary Tyler Moore show, and add Paul Lynde and various campy plotlines, and you get a deliberately unfunny mess that is supposed to be ironic.
A little bit too much winking to the audience for my tastes, but the film does a very good job in its recreation of the films it is satirising/giving tribute to/parodying/condemning/praising in many ways (especially the look/style), apart from in its duration, which goes on far too long to not get stale.
I was going to attempt watching all of Anna's filmography today but to be completely honest, I don't think I possibly can. I'm not saying that because this movie was bad, I'm saying that because this movie was A LOT. Like, I just ate a four course meal. Seriously, this movie is SO absurd that it puts into perspective IMPORTANT topics such as feminism, sexual liberation, gender roles, and more. Anna Biller has really created a gem of a movie and I can't wait to indulge in the rest of her creations--But first, a glass of water. LOL.
Biller's first feature comes off like a grand ode to the influences and style. Through sheer force of talent, it's difficult to imagine any current filmmaker working within a particular milieu and be able to approximate a pinpoint interpretation so effectively. Again, the unique nature of approaching through production design and disciplined mannerisms here are the key. Taking nods from 60's exploitation and new wave is one thing; visually approximating it to a tee is pure technique. At two hours, it certainly falters from a lack of big picture focus - a tight 80-90 to the genre conventions would have solidified this. But when you get a white horse for your picture, the fuck if you are not going to use it type of thing. The amount of work done here: the animation, the songs, starring, editing, design, and probably ten other jobs... with no budget, yet still such precise detail. The Love Witch would go on to solidify the aptitude of this particular filmmaker but if this isn't pure viva filmmaking, I don't know what is.
this. is. super genius I have no more words
“There has never been a better time to be a man.” Well shit. What a serious fucking movie. Honest to god bizarre but effective as some kind of sick, silly, descent into sex in suburbia. A throwback. An indictment. A fucking insanely successful piece of pulp that simaltaneously deconstructs the Inherent maleness of the exact kind of pulp it’s parodying. All the more amazing that it somehow sustains itself while trafficking in the same exact thematic and aesthetic territory for two full hours. I now worship at the altar of Anna Biller. Despite the worry that it might indicate some falsity as far as my credibility as woke may go, I can’t help but compare her to Richard Kelly. Though his instincts often lead him more to speed up than stretch out (with the exception of his film that mostly closely resembles the work of Biller; The Box), he has the same natural knack for establishing rhythms through eery editing, sharp characterization, and really strong filmmaking too bold for a mere mortal to comprehend on their very first viewing. I adore this shit. One of those films that makes you wish you didn’t ever have to blink. Viva la Viva!
Completely adore Anna Biller since I got interested in her feminist ideals and film making inspirations which puts me in the loop on the weirdness and style of her movies. This is a full blown female fantasy with nothing held back and I was into it.
Reminiscent of Russ Meyer and John Waters films, Anna Biller’s feature film debut is charming, beautiful to look at and has some very genuine laugh out loud moments. You can really see the craftsmanship Biller puts into her films, as she does many of the key roles herself. Just like with The Love Witch, I had a little issue with the run time. The first few scenes where characters laugh a little too much at their jokes, go on for too long, but once it gets going, it’s an easy film to watch and enjoy. This is a modern day sexploitation film that could’ve easily been a third installment in the Grindhouse series, and I will always like and appreciate films like that.
I respect and support Anna Biller 100% as an artist a feminist and a filmmaker but there were some parts of this that just didn't work
☁️ the dreamiest of films & agnes was the dreamiest of girls ☁️
Man, I adored The Love Witch, but I'm struggling with this one. It is patently too long, for one thing, and I feel like it keeps landing right in that weird space between 'are you satirizing/deconstructing/commenting on this Thing or are you just doing this Thing,' especially in the way the plot just bounds from incident to incident without a ton of cohesion. And I am really finding it hard to get past the multiple (!!!) scenes of sexual assault that are literally never commented on or analyzed at all -- knowing Biller's work and aims as I do, I knew those scenes weren't just tossed in for no reason (or for comedy) and had a distinctive point to make, but that point just wasn't on the screen. I'm not sure I can give credit for what I know of an artist outside of the work itself. I don't need it all spelled out, but no narrative acknowledgement of a troubling thing just sort of comes off as a straightforward troubling thing. idk. Of course it looked stunning and colorful and everything, and I appreciated its absurdity and its originality. I guess it's fair to say there was a lot of creative growth between this and Love Witch. I was just really expecting/hoping to adore this one as well and was left a teeny bit miffed. (also I actually searched on here to see if there was a way to sort reviews by gender because I care about male takes on this movie even less than I do everything else in life lmao)
I honestly don't know if I prefer Love Witch or this.
"This is going to be the freshest thing since Liberace. Whaddya say?"  Viva is a satire of aspirational consumerist fantasy while at the same time glorying in its bad taste trappings. I could easily believe that Anna Biller spends a lot of time in real life engaging in her character's favorite hobby of sitting around in the bath drinking wine and reading vintage lifestyle magazines. 1972 America is a perfect setting for this theme, the height of middle class prosperity and tacky faux-opulent creature comforts, before the oil crisis hit and everything went to hell. There is a lot that is amateurish and not great about the filmmaking here (I can understand why this had so many walkouts from film critics when it premiered), but it all sort of fits. The editing is really slack and I think this would have benefited from having a half hour cut out of it. On the other hand, the plot is so shapeless that I found this an easier sit than The Love Witch, which has the same length problems but suffers from having a more predictable storyarc to wade through. Viva just drifts from vignette to vignette, giving the audience a lot of time to soak up the production details of the world it presents and catch the nuances of Biller's humor. As an actor, Biller is almost as wooden and awkward as Quentin Tarantino, but her self-conscious unease in front of the camera fits her character and theme. Almost all the acting is a weird mix of modern journeyman line deliveries undercutting an attempt at vintage camp, fitting for a story about people trying desperately to escape themselves in adopted identities. Bridget Brno's line delivery here in Viva is uncannily similar to Samantha Robinson's in The Love Witch. I wonder if there's a vintage source they're both copying, or if Brno was just the most successful actor at achieving the delivery Biller was aiming for the first time around. I was slightly repelled at the beginning but slowly warmed to Biller's idiosyncrasies. I thought it was cute that she named her character Barbi, an obvious reference to the doll but with spelling that's a specific tribute to Playboy model Barbi Benton, who Biller resembles.
¸.•*¨*✧*♡CLUB FRIENDSHIP♡*✧*¨*•.¸ In theory, I should be super into Anna Biller, her movies, and their aesthetics but I was underwhelmed by The Love Witch and I was similarly disappointed by Viva. I get that it's supposed to be very tongue-in-cheek but, after a while, the faux nostalgia becomes overwhelming and obnoxious (and I love faux nostalgia so this hurts me to say). I had a lot of clothing envy but that was about it. Such a drab watch despite all of the bright colors.
CLUB FRIENDSHIP When I first watched Anna Biller’s films The Love Witch and Viva, the feelings I felt took me back to the very beginning of my foray into cinephilia as a teen, when I first experienced the films of Quentin Tarantino. Both Tarantino and Biller are auteurs who truly care about the history of film and the endless opportunities one has to pay homage and incorporate elements of both classic and obscure works, twisting and playing with them so the result is simultaneously a throwback of sorts and something fresh, intelligent and engaging. This isn’t limited to costume design, sets, and other ephemera but also to the way things are shot, expressed, and presented. But where Biller truly stands out for me is her adamant, vocal desire to be understood and taken seriously. I follow her on Twitter and you should too - she’s incredibly active, sharing stories of all kinds and getting into somewhat futile arguments with trolls. She is a feminist, a creative, a rabble-rouser. She excites me more than most filmmakers currently in the biz today. Biller directs herself in Viva’s main role as Barbi, a neglected housewife who decides to engage in sex work. Cartoons from old issues of Playboy are a big influence on the production: lurid, corny set pieces and clothes (or lack therof) as well as one-liners so bad that they’re incredibly funny. Biller’s love of classic Hollywood is expressed through her own performance; her elocution and the way she carries herself is very Stanwyck, very Crawford. I detect Fassbinder, Buñuel, and Demy in the film as a whole; Biller wears an Anna May Wong costume during an orgy scene. I personally don’t think her influences overwhelm her story, but instead inform it. Those less in tune with film history might mistake Viva for a parody or blasé erotica, which is unfortunate.
I especially loved the Viva magazine with dreamy feminine-gaze softcore (I wish it was real, I'd absolutely subscribe to it), the 70's dinner party-style food spreads, and Biller's stalwart dedication to color palette and blocking, often matching clothing and set design to great effect (she did this for The Love Witch as well). You can see many of the traits in this film that will no doubt become her trademarks as her filmography grows (many of which are aspects of The Love Witch too): female gaze versus male gaze, ideology and patriarchy's observances of female liberation versus liberation in practice, glamour as a tool for feminism and self-love, voyeurism (she self-describes as a voyeur in the making-of feature on the DVD), burlesque culture, women's relationships with each other versus their relationships with men, the ways women are expected to take care of men, the feminine desire for emotional connection and romantic physicality versus the masculine trait of self-involvement. I will say there are multiple scenes where Barbie/Viva is raped (two times she is drugged and then raped); none of them are graphic, some of them are mostly implied rather than filmed, but all of them are upsetting and are meant to be. I couldn't stop thinking of Biller's twitter thread about how men angrily left the theater at the Rotterdam Film Festival. When women make films, we expose that which patriarchy has worked long to keep behind closed doors. Biller's dedication to classic cinema is absolute and I respect it more than love it sometimes, but I enjoyed this.
A hard one to score. Totally bonkers. Definitely felt authentically 70s, and it's super impressive how much Anna Biller put into this, creating the costumes as well as acting and directing. It was interesting to watch...the many nude scenes helped...but it did feel like an amusing spectacle quite a bit, with the deliberately wooden acting and the great cosrumes, oh and the nudity. I preferred The Love Witch, but this was a really good effort for sure.
Story : 2/3 (good) Craft: 2.5/3 (good/exceptional) Spirit: 2.5/3 (good/exceptional) Total: 7/9 (4 stars)
nothing beats anna’s attention to detail and dedication to immersion
Rewatching Biller's films on film makes me ecstatic and sad at the same time. Ecstatic for obvious reasons, sad because I realize that there are no real reasons (only fucking pragmatic ones) for the switch to digital. All films could look like this one! And especially: All filmed bodies could look like the ones in VIVA, completely exposed and yet protected by a material gaze affectionately registering their uniqueness.
insanely authentic and rich in detail, this transcends sexploitation as if it was shrugging away it's own inhibitions. the LIGHTING is DIVINE, and the colour is impeccable. work of a true auteur. also the scene in the salon with the guy eating sugar - i was CRYING with laughter, and WHY have i never seen a focus racking sex scene before that was INSPIRED. there's so much in here that is truly original to examine and yet it never, ever has so much as a hair that distracts from the 70's illusion. ART.

This film will take you on a trip into the Uncanny Valley (of the Dolls). Amazing first film for Biller. You can tell she was working out the tone and voice that she ends up mastering in Love Witch.
I'm a big fan of Anna's work. I saw The Love Witch first, so seeing this one almost makes me think of it as "practice" for the more complete work/vision of TLW. That being said, I can still appreciate what this film was trying to do, although I am not sure if she completely reached it, she got close. I think the film could have benefited from a better actress as Barbi/Viva (sorry Anna!) --she was too stilted in my opinion; it would have helped to express her message if she had been able to more convincingly portray a wider range of emotions with her acting. The costuming was fantastic; especially at the orgy.
anna biller has stated a good number of times that she has little or no interest in 70s exploitation & russ meyers, and i believe her. that doesn't mean that her movies don't play exactly like 70s exploitation & russ meyers, because they really, really do. if you played any given scene from viva with no context given, you'd probably think it's a beyond the valley of the dolls out-take. sirk is here as well, but it's run through a loopy, exploitation filter. and there is a not-subtle feminist message woven throughout, of course. the women are thoughtful, searching for fulfillment & love. the men are loathsome wanks who assume everything & everyone exists for their consumption & pleasure. personally, it plays more as caricature of reality than profound insight, but i'm not the final authority on such matters. regardless of how you interpret them, i think both of her films are delights & demented hoots. anyone who liked the love witch will find plenty to enjoy here as well, & ought to seek it out.
Anne Biller's type of guy is so narrow that I thought the male lead in this and the Love Witch were the same man. But they are, in fact, different actors.
The 👏 sexual 👏 revolution 👏 happened 👏 on 👏 men’s 👏 terms 👏
you know a film has its heart at the right place when one character hands another one an antique wooden duck as a souvenir.
Anna Biller: ambitious, genius, cinematic spirit, biting commentator, preeminent cinematic feminist, Russ Meyer and Douglas Sirk's better combined successor. (Also seeing this made me realise how far off I was about The Love Witch being a riff on sexploitation. There's aspects of it in there, but it is definitively doing a significantly different thing. Viva is pulling much more from that vein, and seeing her thematic concerns shift into new stylistic and narrative territory over time is seeing a true artist being so supremely confident in herself that it's breathtaking.)
And I thought the amount of costume changes in barbarella was impressive.
when the one girl said "isn't it weird how we have to get used to existing in our most natural state"...........i felt that
Anna Biller is a true visionary. Only she could reverse sexploitation like that and make it a such a poignant social satire.
Babies can't have cigarettes and alcohol. Babies can only have milk. I know Anna Biller is actually a competent artist at the top of her game but y'all can have your "how's your sex life?" Room spoon-throwing parties and I'll just be drinking up this milk instead, irony-free. Viva is those silly Playboy cartoons come to life with a dash of that Todd Haynes' attuned awareness that "the good ole days" and "Men's Lifestyle" magazines are crocks of shit that creates entitled shits. (Also this movie answers the how's your sex life question. "We have a great sex life, honey.") The languid pace, stilted acting, cartoon strip dialogue and immense set design is *pure*art*. Hey, everyone! I'm gonna sing a song, it's about love!
Watching an Anna Biller movie, one that she stars in no less, knowing that she is a hapa is absolutely crushing. This context intensifies everything about her work imo.
"There has never been a better time to be a man. The willing women, the dandy clothes, the frills, the big rings and jewelry, the open shirts, the sense of entitlement. Take it from me: savour this time. For it will soon be gone, never to return." The female male gaze. What a serious, major work this is. This is self-representing, self-sexualising and bruisingly honest cinema, responding and reclaiming a genre, time and style that would have been absolutely against Biller's rights and interests as a filmmaker and a human being. Biller's passion and versatility bleeds through every single perfectly-realised frame of this cinematic indulgence, and, although this is apparently a parody and often hilarious, there is a distinct vein of sadness inflecting every interaction Barbie has with a man. It was horrible then, it was bad in 2007, and it's still awful now, and Biller's beautiful, stylised vision makes the timeless narrative even more timeless as a work of visual art. My, this is stunning. I just love it when a film balances humour and pathos perfectly and wraps it up in absolute visual splendour. Just watch it, goddammit.
I'm perhaps not in the best place to judge 'Viva' as I am completely unfamiliar with the (s)exploitation films that it attempts to emulate and satirize all at once. However even to the uninitiated 'Viva' has a unique and enjoyable sense of style which feels very distinctive. From the luscious set design to the stilted dialogue and performances 'Viva' fully commits to emulating it's inspirations. Despite this the film feels very bloated at slightly over two hours. By the third musical interlude I was happy to see the back of the film. The film did not do enough to justify its large amount of sexual violence. For a film that is so light in tone having multiple rape scenes (and at least two more rape attempts) seems completely unnecessary. Surely there are better ways of critiquing playboy culture without such scenes which go nearly completely unaddressed during the rest of the film (in fact the film ends on the 'happy' note of the lead character accepting a role in a musical directed by her rapist). These misguided scenes hang over the film and detract from any of its successful aspects.
I totally freaked out in front of a friend (as well as some strangers) when I found an unopened, out of print DVD of this film in a record store. My reaction, as I would have anticipated, was totally justified, because Viva is sublime. Anna Biller and her work excites me like none other.
Critic Consensus: Though it's lengthy and doesn't always walk the line between schlock and kitschy homage successfully, Viva's lovely visuals and knowing humor are undeniable.
The problem with Ms Anna Biller is that she packs too much quality intellectually, visually, and emotionally to be really decoded successfully by a mass audience that can process any two of those things in sketch doses at any one time, but has no idea what to do with 2 hours of it with no laugh track. For example, any 20 random frames from this movie would make a hit exhibit in any photography gallery. The production and lighting are so impeccably clever and detailed as stills they would be considered gorgeous (even when they include dubious looking male characters, which are btw masterpieces of casting). The problem is since she makes every scene look _that_ polished, I suspect many people just forget the work that went into it and start taking it for granted reducing it to just "that sexploitation 70s look." The feminism is also too clever and nuanced for simple consumption. It's nothing like your average museum exhibit on feminism so scared of saying the wrong thing it cannot articulate anything past "you can also be a CEO" platitudes. Miss Biller is not trapped in the safety of the first wave. Yes, every guy in the film is a moron but theres much more to it than that. There is a complex game of female gaze here, one taking place always through a mirror. In short, Ms Biller has made here a cult object of beauty and depth to be digested slowly.
#52FilmsByWomen 2017 pt. 40. As in The Love Witch, Biller's production design is absolutely stunning. If I hadn't known the film was from 2007, I could easily have believed it was a skin flick from 1972. This is not an easy thing to pull off. But unlike other "retrosploitation" outings (Astron-6, I'm looking in your direction), this has form-function cohesion and an intention behind the styling. Much of the film is a conversation between 2nd and 3rd-wave feminism as the future gazes at the past gazing at the future. Cf. The Lobster
I really like Anna Biller, her commitment to her vision is amazing, her perspective is unique, and her vision is gorgeous. Anna is the force behind Viva and, most recently, The Love Witch. I say force as she serves as writer, director, producer, art director, set decorator, costumer, animator, and she did the music. Oh, and in Viva, she was the star. If something cant' be found, she will make it. I commend her for her efforts and hope she continues in the future, truly she is amazing. The theme that runs through her work is the depiction of women in film in different periods. For The Love Witch, it was the 1960s; in Viva we are firmly in the early 1970s, the era of free love, swinging and women's lib. The tone of Viva is fun but there is social commentary as Anna plays Barbi, the bored housewife whose husband brings home the money but works late, takes numerous business trips which he likes to extend for vacation time, and likes his lovely wife to remain firmly secured at home. Barbi grows weary of this less than equitable situation and an ensuing argument see hubby Mark storm out. Serendipitously Barbi's best friend Sheila also splits from her husband finding both ladies unattached and ready to embrace the free love ethos of the time. That is when Barbi becomes Viva, someone ready to live and determine her own course. However, with each encounter disproving the glories of free sex and parties, Viva becomes increasing disenchanted with empty liaisons, she needs something more. For Anna, this seems to summarize her views on society. The overt sexism of era was exhibited during her brief employment wherein her boss saw her career path based on routine gropings, and the oppressive and soulless home life her husband idealized. As a counterpoint, the swinging random sexual hook ups were no better. This dissection of mores was never heavy handed and often was presented in a fun way. She never lectured but her point got across. The satire is strong with this one. A strong point with Anna's work is her creative direction. The set decoration was always on point, the clothes, the make up, everything seethed kitsch and it was gorgeous. Again, her vision is exemplary and her commitment to it, astounding. She knows what she wants to present and does not flinch. There was a good deal of nudity, both male and female, and Anna did her share of it. She is her art. The acting and dialogue were both a bit overwrought and, especially with the former, exaggerated, often deliberately so. That can work with sketch comedy but in a feature, it can become tiresome. Hence, the film dragged. It clocks in at just over two hours, it should have been 90 minutes. The film was a lot of fun and looked spectacular but was in need of some editing. Anna reminds me a bit of Rob Zombie, both have uncompromising visions and some glorious set pieces, but these set pieces don't always fit together into a whole; sometimes they work better individually or as still images. With so much going for it and with huge respect to Anna Biller, I wanted to like this film more than I did. I am giving an extra half star because it looks so good. See Viva, but perhaps watch it in chunks.
Anna Biller's naughty, independently produced debut looks and sounds exactly like the early 70s sexploitation flick which she skillfully mocks, satirizes and pays a loving homage to, all at once. Starring herself as Barbi without 'e' - a bored housewife that presumes the identity of the titular libertine - Viva is amusing and refreshing in equal measures. After her husband Rick (Chad England) goes on a month-long business trip, Biller's "Belle de Jour" starts discovering the joys and ploys of the sexual revolution - prostitution, drug abuse, nudist colonies, horny hippies, bisexuality, orgies and the most pretentious of artists. The quirky characters she comes in contact with frequently act as if they wandered off the set for a commercial or erotic magazine shoot, adding to the silly comic effect. But, even though all of them are extremely caricatured, one can easily recognize real people, as well as biting social commentary behind their flamboyant appearance. As in the last year's campy thriller The Love Witch, Biller is the multi-hyphenate in charge of directing, writing, editing, designing sets and costumes, even animating a short psychedelic sequence - all with an assured hand. Drenching everything from walls, through mini dresses and all the way to velvet cushions in saturated colors and trip-inducing patterns, she creates an uninterrupted string of visually stunning shots which make for an unforgettable cinematic experience. Also praiseworthy are the cast's deliberately stilted, softcore-porn-level performances which add a lot to Viva's overwhelming kitschy charm.
A picture perfect homage to 70s sexploitation films with a sharp eye for art direction. The booze budget alone must have been epic.
Amazingly, Anna Biller claims that her films aren't meant to be satires but serious social commentaries, which means she could very well be the Ed Wood of Feminist Cinema. However, there's too much artifice in her work to not be intentional. Nevertheless, her first feature length--an homage to '70s sexploitation films--is near genius regardless of who she may or may not be trolling.
"That's Mae West you ASs!" Anna Biller doing what she does best with a female centered film having fun and sex in a rompy color-filled modern day exploitation film. She's a real auteur of her craft. Hell she starred, directed, edited, did the art production and costumes?? Holy shit that's so much to do for one film and she balances it all out so well. My only complaint might have been that this could have been cut about thirty minutes maybe? Overall, I just love the exploits of Viva exploring the sexual revolution of the seventies.
Overlong, but still amazing. I want to marry this smart, sharp woman!
I didn't love this as much as The Love Witch, but it's still mostly charming and enjoyable. Anna Biller's attention to detail is impeccable and I admire her subversive take on sexism in the "free love" era. The stilted dialogue can be a bit much (especially for a 2-hour film), but the vivid set design and costumes are fantastic and it's clearly a love letter to '60s/'70s sexploitation.
Anna Biller takes a stab at sexploitation and it's a lot of fun. I get why it takes her so long to make her movies - her attention to detail, from sets, costumes, film effects, delivery, etc, is impeccable, painstakingly deliberate, and unmatched by none save the highest caliber of directors, maybe. I really hope it doesn't take her another 9 years to make her next one, but even if it does, I'll still be anxiously awaiting it.
Anna Biller is freaking awesome. Watched "The Love Witch" last year and I still believe that's her best, but Viva is not far behind.
It has some great moments and an incredible attention to production detail but sadly mimics the pacing of the genre's worst examples. It straddles the line between homage and parody so consistently, I know a statement is being made but I'm not entirely certain what it is most of the time. With better editing and some stronger subversive elements, this could've been great.
Despite her multitude of creative credits writer/director/actor/songwriter/art director Anna Biller doesn't specialize in writing or direction or acting in as much as she does in a campy midcentury vernacular. Note how every song (I think there are four) is overdubbed without any pretense of authenticity, but that something so seemingly incidental as drapes has been meticulously thought out. (Really, every indoor scene depicts a room or two with really impressive drapes in it.) She seems to be finding her footing as a storyteller, or at least I'm not certain of what to make of the film’s narrative about a woman’s sexual awakening circa 1970. On one hand, Biller’s indictment of male entitlement and insecurity is sharp-witted and often hilarious, but on the other her heroine’s transition from housewife to prostitute is tentative, as though Biller isn’t certain of what she’s meant to iconify to a contemporary audience. (It is clear, however, that she’s seen Beyond the Valley of the Dolls at least two dozen times.) But her films are so weird and assured in their parody of gender roles that to critique their ham-handed narratives is certainly to miss the point. This is also a reminder that her latest film, The Love Witch, is totally amazing.
While the dialogue is stylized in a way that's a little tricky to get into at first, to an even higher extent than The Love Witch, once I got onto its wavelength, I had an amazing time with it. It's both tremendously fun, supremely sexy, and has a strong feminist message regarding how male desire is often made at the expense of female desire or wishes.
Anna Biller creates an amazing 70's aesthetic from which she breaks down tropes and gender norms/performances found in 70's exploitation films. Unlike films such as Dazed and Confused, which looks to create a period aesthetic for the purpose of nostalgia. Biller seems to be doing so for the purpose of critical analysis. This is not to say that she is not having fun, nor is it to imply that this is not a fun film. This film is great. The thing that I can really get behind is Biller's attention to detail. Each frame is bursting with detail from background to foreground. The art direction is superb. Read some other (better written) reviews and check this film out for yourself.
Boogie Nights and Valley of the Dolls and RAW COMEDY. This is amazing. Riddled with bant in every frame. I had such a good time the whole way through.

anna biller is a goddamn national treasure
Two suburban couples experiment with sex, drugs and bohemia in early 1970's Los Angeles. You could basically copy and paste my review from the The Love Witch onto this. I actually preferred Viva even though it has the same flaw of being 30 minutes to long. I'm glad there's someone who making this sort of cinema and will be interested in what Anna Billar does next.
A feature film full of porn acting. Nice! The film does not warrant it's ridiculous running time but it's still very funny and it's something different. I decided to check this out after really enjoying The Love Witch and I'm glad that I did.
If Anna Biller can just keep making throwback movies, I would be satisfied. This one feels like a movie made by Russ Meyer but from a female perspective. It does have the boobs, full nudity, sex and flashy 70s fashion that you would see in a sexploitation film. This one for a first feature, I enjoyed for just being a fun and sexy film. It's not perfect due to its running time but fans of classic b-movie cinema should really check this out.
52 Films By Women Challenge (2017): Film #7 It took me a while to 'get' this film. The on purpose bad acting, the cheapness all distracted me and served as a barrier to my enjoyment at first. It was only towards the end that I realised the style served more than as a parody of bad 60s/70s brady bunch style acting; it acts as a commentary on the performative nature of patriarchal gender roles, the constant product placement asides serve to highlight the way capitalism commodifies gender - further strengthening the patriarchy. Even the alienating nature of the film reflects how society alienates us from ourselves. I particularly liked how the 'sexual revolution' was critiqued, the film pointed out how it lead to whole new difficulties for women at the time. Even now as a young woman I have first hand experience of the limits of 'sex positive' feminism. This isn't talked about very often and it was explored well here. Viva wasn't always the most enjoyable or easiest film to watch but it was certainly fascinating and gave me a lot to think about.
What a fun watch. It had a great production value and very authentic to the era.
what the hell is anna biller on
Super-impressive Sexploitation pastiche/parody that hits every visual and tonal nail on the head. Satirically nightmarish at times, nightmarishly drawn out at others. Interesting interview with director Anna Biller on the audience response to the movie here: annabillersblog.blogspot.co.uk/2006/10/thoughts-on-viva-premiere.html "Audiences are masochists and they're brutal, nothing is too strong for them. I see that now."
52 films by women 2017: 16/52. If you're looking for a way to get your anticipation for Anna Biller's The Love Witch down to a realistic level, why not watch her previous feature? A long, long, long two hours, Viva dedicates itself so wholeheartedly to pastiching a long-dead subgenre that it acts as a kind of prophylactic for its wider points. What I mean here is this; there are, obviously, connections between misogyny today and misogyny in the 1970s. But rather than point them up, Viva keeps underscoring what's different, to the point where all you can appreciate is the surfaces; the loud suits and wide lapels, the incessant easy-listening music, the Polaroid cameras. It's well-observed, certainly, but what is the point of obsessing this much about the minutia? Twenty years ago, this vision of masculinity was so dated that Mike Myers could build a profitable comedy franchise out of mocking it, but Biller seems to treat it like a fresh, relevant target. Biller is certainly an attentive parodist, capable of finding exactly the right sounds, fabrics and lenses to create that 1970s ambience. But in narrative and directorial terms that attention curdles into pedantry. It's never funny, thanks largely to Biller's determination to repeat every funny-bad acting tic until even people watching a film in the theatre next door get it. It's also funereally paced, frequently taking five shots to get across points the exploitation films it's parodying would have to make in two, and it repeats an image of Biller smoking in the bath for little observable reason. (It's worth mentioning that the nudity, like the gay stereotypes, are only implicitly parodied; you assume Biller has a critical perspective on the exploitative elements of the films she's drawing from, but you have to take it on trust because they're so faithfully reproduced) Biller, clearly, loves revelling in this stuff, and her sheer level of multihyphenate control over every aspect of the film is to be applauded. If there's one job she should surrender to someone else, though, it's the editing, if only to get it down to a bearable run-time. I lasted one repetitive, obvious hour before it decided to become a bad musical as well, then I bailed.
Anna Biller is a true auteur. In Viva she is credited with a staggering 10 crew roles, as well as playing lead actress. The attention to detail is staggering, especially considering the comparatively tiny budget. There have been plenty modern of films that have attempted to mimic 70's cinema but none have come as close as this. With that being said Viva is seen through a more modern lens, and pokes fun at the lack of female power in the films it is inspired by.
Anna Biller manages to create a work which is both a biting satire of and a keen indulger of a bygone genre, as a way to skewer outdated social roles through the prism of entitlement and the simmering weaponisation of white picket utopianism.
I basically had the same reaction to this as I did watching Anna Biller's THE LOVE WITCH. The film has the same strengths (fab production design, delicious skewering of the sexual politics of the patriarchy and the notion of the 60s and 70s as a time of liberation) and the same weaknesses (it stretches the material at two hours).

Biller's aesthetics screams excess: it is supercolorful, tacky and overacted. But you can't get enough of its personality and ambience! You kind of live it too, especially thanks to Anna's performance. She really enlivens the film's spirit - even if awkwardly and shyly.
Anna Biller is an exciting talent. Among the many sensual delights to be found in Viva are beautiful sets, perfect musical choices, and fun period detail. But I'm trying to come to terms with the insistence on using camp imagery and technique (as far as the acting and script are concerned) to espouse a particular worldview (which I happen to agree with). The mixture of self-aware schlock and progressive politics is appealing for numerous reasons, but it makes the content feel less urgent and the film as a whole feel tedious at times. I think something interesting could come of this formula, but it doesn't quite work for me here.
This is a MASTERPIECE
This is a little bit more muddled than the love witch for me, but still extremely clever. Such a great and interesting look at what is ingrained in society and what the true consequences of that are. It shows things in such a non-obvious and non condescending way that it is incredibly effective and what could be such a preachy message is laid clear and obvious and oh so interesting.
Viva is obviously a passion project and while hearing the borrowed music from Camille 2000 got me all excited, the movie is overly long and becomes a bit of a bore as the plot becomes somewhat repetitive as Viva is discovering her sexual identity by moving from one partner to the next. Also, the movie would have benefitted from having a real actress in the leading role. Anna Biller is obviously nervous in several scenes and keeps blinking her eyes uncontrollably, which was distracting. There's good stuff here as well (like the overall tone and attention to detail), but I have a feeling Anna Billers followup movie will be much better.
Starring director Anna Biller as Barbie, a bored housewife who yearns for sexual adventure, she adopts the persona of Viva and embarks on a journey through prostitution, lesbianism and self discovery. It's overlong and in need of some pruning throughout, but it's funny, rich in satire and the slavish attention to detail to recreate the 70s era of filmmaking is astounding.
YES @ anna biller, this was such a good movie i mean it'd be completely flawless if it was 30min shorter but omg i'm living for this!!!!!
Artificial sets, intentionally bad acting and full-frontal nudity abound in Anna Biller's silly tribute to the harmless American sexploitation movies of the late 60s and early 70s. And I was totally onboard with it at first, the opening scenes of suburban couple Sheila & Mark and their neighbour Barbi being an absolute joy to watch (in particular, Jared Sanford, who plays Mark, seems utterly authentic). It's an exaggerated take on sitcom characters, as they spend their Sunday sitting around the outdoor pool getting smashed on scotch from morning til night. The next day, Barbi even gets comically chased around an office desk by her lecherous boss (who then fires her for not putting out). And so, bored, Barbi & Sheila decide take advantage of women's lib and become call girls. But the joke wears thin very, very quickly - after about the length of a sitcom, in fact: 25 minutes or so. And for some reason this movie runs for over two fucking hours. When the comedy turns to drama, it's impossible to care about these characters, because they're just cartoons really. Such a shame that something that starts so well ends up as such a drag.
Extraordinary film. Not sure why anybody would purposely make the worst film of all time, but that's what has happened here. I think it was making some social point but I couldn't get far enough past the ham acting to care.
Gorgeous homage to '60s/'70s sexploitation but, much like Anna Biller's The Love Witch, it runs a little too long and runs out of steam about 20 minutes before the end.
*Takes fake sip of whisky and laughs unconvincingly*
Although not as accomplished or enjoyable as The Love Witch, Viva is a fine feature debut from Anna Biller (who had previously been learning her craft in a number of short films). It's fun, vibrant, and effectively nails the tone of this kind of film, while at the same time skewering it and making some incisive points.
I’m still trying to process this one, I’m not sure if I liked it or not, but one thing’s for sure is that I have been left intrigued by the director, Anna Biller, and left wanting to check out more of her work. This film blurs the line between pastiche and schlocky sexploitation films quite well and brings up a lot of interesting subtext that I have probably barely scratched the surface of, the film is so long and quite full on that I do wonder if it maybe stumbled around that line just a little too much. Added to #52FilmsByWomen: letterboxd.com/superalexman/list/52filmsbywomen-2017/
First off: I made a total bumblef**k of an error reviewing The Love Witch where I assumed, since she did just about everything else on that movie (as here - she even does some animation in this one), Anna Biller had played the title role. As soon as I saw her in this I was like, "ok that is not the same person…" so, sorry about that, I just wanted to mention it here for anyone who read that review. Her performance (and everyone else's) here is just as deliberately mannered and styled on the period the whole thing is emulating as I thought it was there, though, and just as much fun, though as with The Love Witch I'm not sure if it's 2 hours worth of fun: I'm not sure if its substance really justifies either the running time or the obvious effort that went into producing it (when you think of how quickly the actual movies it's aping were probably made). I see people talking about the importance of the female gaze with these movies - and yes, we need more women making movies, absolutely - but (and maybe it's just my usual completely messed up personal sense of gender - to me it's all valid at the same time none of it is) I just don't know if you tested it blind with an audience that they'd think it was particularly different from anyone else (meaning, men) trying to recreate the styles of John Waters, Frank Perry, Herschell Gordon Lewis, Russ Meyer? (I'm not too familiar with Meyer's stuff but it feels like he belongs in this list?) etc (I'd even go so far back as Vincente Minnelli who to me kind of had a "female" eye). I'm just not sure if that aspect is as significant as some want it to be - like, the thing is to me, that I think I was trying to say in my Love Witch review too, is that the thing about artists (real artists, I'm not talking the macho likes of Michael Bay here, for instance) in general is they don't look at things the way everyone else does - certainly Biller doesn't and that's why her work is so visually compelling - so I'm not sure we can really gender their gaze the same way? Maybe I'm missing something. Probably I'm missing something. And I'm not making myself nearly as clear as I wish I could (my head's a mess so far this year, to be honest). But it sure is fun and pleasing to the eye (if not quite as beautiful, accomplished, and watchable as The Love Witch - this one kind of captures the 70s tone too much?). Some of the music's gorgeous too (even if I was smart enough to realise it wasn't all original this time… the songs, again, are awful, however… but I think most of them were meant to be…)
Just the right side of knowing parody. This perfectly captures the hair, makeup, costume, and general vibe of Sixties and early Seventies sex comedies. I was hoping for a deeper feminist message. The Love Witch will hopefully build on this.
Biller's sexploitation answer to Scott Sanders' Black Dynamite, this Russ Meyer-esque satire takes a bold stance in the face of the male-centered world of moviemaking. Biller has stolen the male gaze and turned it on herself and her costars, in what can only be described as both illuminating and extraordinarily brave. Showing hypermasculinity and misogyny for the farce that they have become, and always were, the director fights patriarchal disparity with a sense of humor that nonetheless embraces the undeniable aesthetic beauty of bright colors and comically-overdone sets.
Having really enjoyed the Love Witch by Anna Biller, I had to watch some of her previous work. This is a tale of suburban experimentation in the 1970's, it's in an exploitation style but with the key difference being that it's from a female point of view. This different viewpoint is eye opening, as it leads to many hilarious scenes where the male characters are reduced to two dimensional bimbos. Groping, sleazy, manipulative, all the men in this will do anything they can to get a bit of lady action. Social commentary like this is very powerful, possibly too close to reality for some people. In addition, there is a LOT of nudity in this.
"There are some thematic aspects of Viva I wish Biller had pushed a little further (and a few scenes I wish were shaved down to expedite the pace), but there’s an endlessly enjoyable aesthetic in her staging of the film’s lingerie lounging, Scotch swilling, porn-browsing swinger-era softcore smut I can’t help but take delight in. Just the way characters punctuate each of their own lame jokes with unwarranted, maniacal laughter feels both so true to the era & so clearly aligned with what Biller wants to accomplish in her modernization. It’s incredible she was able to figure out her own concrete sense of style as soon as her first feature." Read the full review here.
Viva tells the story of Barbara (Anna Biller, who also writes and Directs) a bored housewife in 1972 who gets sucked into the sexual revolution. Abandoned by her husband, Barbi is dragged into trouble by her girlfriend, who spouts women's lib as she gets Barbi to discard her bra and go out on the town. Barbi becomes a Red Riding Hood in a sea of wolves, and quickly learns a lot more than she wanted to about nudist camps, the hippie scene, orgies, bisexuality, sadism, drugs, and bohemia. This is both and very good and very bad film at the same time, the good first, the direction, and attention to detail, music, colours and overall feel of the film is incredible. This doesn't feel like a homage film, but it's like a lost film from the late 60's or early 70's, the filmmaking is that good. The downside is I just did not get on with the story, and acting style of the piece, but that be because I feel that I don't know enough about sex cinema from the 60's and 70's. That said Anna Biller seems like a real talent and I can't wait to see The Love Witch, her follow up, which is out later this year.
"HAHAHA"-everyone at anytime
Milwaukee's UWM Union Theater where Biller introduced. I guess she's talented but she's also self-involved, self-aware and self-satisfied to degrees that kind of categorically turn me off. Seeing her attitudes play out in art has me leaving the room after about 30 seconds.
Viva does an excellent job at immersing you in what feels like a perfectly calculated parody of 70s sexploitation. The sets, costumes, and filming style do such a good job at emulating that "look" you almost forget you are actually watching something from our modern era. With that also comes the pitfalls of the genre itself, it's a bit dull. However, that appears to be absolutely intentional as the film is going for near perfect replication of a 70s sexploitation film. Viva is largely a feminist film. The concept of sexual liberation for women is its main theme. The film also includes a few musical numbers that stop the flow of the film and probably are my major concern with it. It would have been just as good, or even better, had the musical numbers been cut.
A little long maybe, but a great indication of what Anna Biller is about. Immaculate era recreation, what at first appears to be simple homage quickly reveals a more cutting underbelly. The camp and kitsch trappings are colourful props for an indictment of chauvinism. Witty, clever, cine-literate... I'm looking forward to THE LOVE WITCH.
anna biller's set design is marvellous. it's a little too long and gets a bit wearisome, but it's a really interesting parody of 70s sexploitation films and it's charming in its own stilted-and-campy way.
I find that Anna Biller is really good at the whole throwback to Russ Meyer kitsch and late '60/early '70s Eurosleaze like Radley Metzger et al. without calling attention to itself and being genuinely fun and amusing. But like The Love Witch, it's also shallow and instantly forgettable.
An amazing, hilarious, complicated, multi-layered film that does some real work and isn't as silly as it might seem at first glance. It inherently rejects the notion that its own aesthetic is (merely) artificial, never blinking at the sheen and gloss it's bathed in and actually letting it function *as* aesthetics in itself. (This is to say, it's not set design and mise-en-scène functioning toward just narrative significance. The settings and objects in the film are art in themselves.) It's seriously biting in the critique it levels against the gender politics of the era but seriously in love with the interior design of that time. It's interested in uncovering oft-told stories but from a new perspective, one that doesn't de-eroticize the sexual revolution but sort of re-eroticizes it, from a more womanly angle. The lighting is bright and quite frontal, usually creating a lovely effect pairing well with its use of celluloid. (Looks as if it didn't have any digital touchup work.) But basically, it's a whole lotta curveballs. Thought I'd have a clearer overall sense of what it's doing after the second viewing, but I think I have less of one.
Too long and a slave to '70s stylings to a stilted fault, but I loved the jabs at different counter-cultural men. The drug haze hippie who uses free love as an excuse to bed any and all women. The artist who elevates his date to muse status and encourages her to model while he stokes his own ego. Too bad self-indulgent musical numbers and bland hello-goodbye conversations distract from Viva's scathing social satire. As a kind-of-man-hater (including myself which makes it hard to function at times) I longed for Biller to take down more whimpering simps and testosterone slathered dunces that project themselves as types in hip scenes both then and now. The more things change, the more they stay the same. Especially in Austin, I can spot a self-styled rock'n'roll jabronie, french fry greasy hair net artist, city witch, "painter," dog collar noise musician, cryptic stone-faced poet, or casually catty zinester loping on the horizon. But Viva's lurid, fetishistic set designs that perfectly match the ON POINT me-generation outfits kept my eyeballs glued to the screen! If the content hit as hard as that LOOK, I'd be all-in!
OK, so this goes on way too long especially given that late-60s/early-70s sleaze isn't precisely *my thing*, but the talent on display here is tangible. I'm really looking forward to checking out Anna Bullet's new one, The Love Witch.
"I want to be called Viva, which in Italy means "to live." Because that's what I want to do now - to live!" "I've always wanted to be a prostitute. It sounds so romantic!!!" Ahh Jeez! where the fuck has this film been all my life!!!!!!!!!?????????
fantastic and hilarious. retro done right. funnier and better-paced than The Love Witch.
Made on what's clearly a much smaller budget than that of the The Love Witch, Viva has all the same charm and insight. Two months ago I hadn't even heard of Anna Biller, and now she's one of my favorite filmmakers. Her attention to detail is remarkable and the precision of her directing makes what could've been an absolutely bizarre movie something very compelling (though it is still very strange). This was such a harsh look at the sexual revolution and how it was marketed to women, as well as the gendered differences in the ways men and women experience sex. And yet it's still so funny? What a movie, honestly. Rating: 77/100
I really dislike camp, and I think this movie has helped me understand why: the dissonance between appreciative homage and parody. I guess most people can interpret parody in a respectful way, but to me it's almost always taking the piss, so I don't see how a movie can be both at the same time.
Wow, man. This is about a woman named Barbie, a woman living in Los Angeles 1972 with her husband Rick. She's best friends with a couple next door, Sheila and Mark, but she's kind of bored and mildly repulsed by the monotony and sexist nature of a housewife life. So she participates in the cultural sexual and spiritual revolution at the time and discovers herself.  I saw this after seeing the trailer to The Love Witch, a film that looked awesome, for preparation. While it is long for the "schtick" it's doing, there are still a lot of things to love about this.  First off, the attention to detail to recreating this era is absolutely outstanding. The set designs are perfectly gaudy and lavishly arranged, with special attention to the furniture and props. The costume design is immaculate, attention grabbing and eye popping but authentic to the time. The colors in this are masterfully used. The particular camera filter (?) used feels very specific to the time and old school, lending to a vintage, lost relic vibe. The music is perfect, wonderfully cheesy in all the right ways. This could easily come off as a jokey 'Tim and Eric' skit but the attention to detail is too great to lump this in with them, it's so wonderful. Anna Biller is clearly a true fan of films from this era and that's lovingly captured on screen. I think the story, while could definitely be cut in places, is engaging. The way that society treated women in places like home, work and even just out in public was jarring and shocking at times. I liked how it used Barbie as a viewpoint into the many different sections of this era, almost like a more specific Forest Gump. I was appalled at the way random men would just catcall at the women and they didn't even respond, perhaps so desensitized to this behavior that it unfazed them. This film even takes aim at the "liberal" awakening, like how it used those open women in a vulnerable situation to take advantage of. Biller really nails every facet of this generation. I think the dialogue/acting could be a deciding factor for a lot of people. It's purposefully stilted and awkward, just like that era's films were. Someone will say something super cheesy and then laugh obnoxiously at it for 5 seconds, look for Mark's character to do this a lot. While I think it's over the top at a few points, Biller slips in some sly commentary at times that make it worthwhile. And the corny acting worked to really sell the authenticity.  I don't know if this fully garners its two hour (!) runtime, I think it runs out of things to say at times outside of recreating this era. But there is some smart analysis into this time that ultimately makes it worthwhile. And I can't praise the set and costume designs enough, truly a visual feast. I don't think I've seen a modern film more embody the aesthetic of Lana Del Rey's music than this one. REALLY looking forward to 'The Love Witch' after this.
"The time 1972, the place Los Angeles": ooh, chic. Really thick, almost suffocating parody -- if you couldn't tell already, so thick -- meant to eviscerate stodgy, old-fashioned, pee-warm gender roles in softcore sexploitation. I guess it might be hilarious if you're in the perfect mood, but no matter what mood you're in it's not very funny.
"Money can't buy you love, but it can buy you a bunch of sex slaves"
Anna Biller's The Love Witch was mostly a success. Viva is not. Overlong by about 40 minutes, it's dull, unfocused and desperate, so very desperate to be culty and outrageous. This film got so tedious I ended up actually angry at it. The production design might be amazing, but the actors waste their great styling by self-consciously gurning at the camera constantly: LOLOLOL geddit, GEDDIT? Ugh.
Entertaining but slight. It's an attempt to make a homage to exploitation films from the 60s and 70s and the art direction and costumes look perfect. Part ironic, part sincere and wholly created by someone who wasn't there. A housewife and her neighbor best friend get curious, get jobs and lose their husbands temporarily while experimenting with their sexuality and drugs.
Some really funny moments. Amazing costume and color work. Pretty decent musical numbers. Sometimes it feels a little too forced for good camp.
Despite the rating, this does make me more excited for "The Love Witch." The parts that work here really work.
Russ Meyer/John Waters/Todd Haynes-esque satire of 60/70s sexploitation cinema by Anna Biller. Set design/costume work is phenomenal. Loved it. Biller knows how to do a genre homage right.
Viva (2007) 8/10 Inventive in ways that I've yet to comprehend, it's one of those films that you can't explain how they happened, what inspired them and how you didn't hear about them before. I'm not an expert on all the genres that it riffs nor all the films that it references, but I can get the feeling that is mocking and at the same time uses to put forward a new perspective of culture, while denouncing what came before. It's also really funny, and the songs are really well performed inside the cheesy style in which they exist, in which, honestly, the whole movie exists.
For being less than a decade old, it may have been just enough ahead of its time not to receive its deserved acclaim. It's Down With Love, but glossier, and with far more bite than (mere) homage. As such, it's rollicking and hilarious, utterly saturated in a celluloid, 1970-era color palette with hues that almost literally scream out at you, drunk on their own pleasure. Having seen only the trailer for the similarly beautiful The Love Witch, needed to see Biller's previous feature before getting access to her latest. Viva keeps a straight face, somehow, even as its characters emit wonderfully/painfully forced laughter. But not only during its obvious tongue-in-cheek moments—the satire persists even during a rape scene. I'm definitely not (qualified to be) the person to say how this scene works or is okay or whatever, so I'll just note that it's there. And that it produced discomfort that was undoubtedly part of the goal to dislodge a viewer from standard viewing practices (L. Mulvey) when watching a body-genre film (L. Williams) like this one. That is to say, the rape is not oriented toward audience pleasure. In fact, traditional elements (like bodies) in general are not aimed at audience pleasure. Instead, Biller lets the sheer ridiculousness of genre codes and this era's absurd values and practices provide their own face-palmy pleasures. But as much as the film seems to look back at "those days," it also knows these ways of thinking are embedded enough in the popular psyche that the film will inevitably mess with many viewers. But anyway, this strikes me as a pretty radical, subversive throwback whose intense meta-campiness goes full-on Brecht in distantiating its audience through overblown artifice and "false" performances that break the flow of genre expectations and rhythms.
I watched Anna Biller's Viva in preparation for her new movie, The Love Witch. Viva is a send-up of 70's sexploitation of the type directed by Radley Metzger - Biller even includes direct references to Metzger's Camille 2000. The design, most of which Biller handled herself, is impeccable, and she uses it to pitch-perfectly dress her story of female empowerment and self-actualization. Viva is an entertaining statement that perhaps does not work as well as Biller intended.
Very good homage to sexual awakening movies of the early 1970s, with the bonus of ultimately actually empowering the women instead of destroying them. Lush colors and fun sets add to the fun, along with the flute-heavy soundtrack.
I don’t think I’ve ever seen another film that’s replicated the sheer ugliness of Chesty Morgan-era 70s sexploitation as well as VIVA. The points of reference are pretty clear - it’s essentially a who’s who of the Something Weird Video catalog - but, I think that focusing on the fact that, say, one sequence looks like something from a Metzger film is the wrong approach to take. It’s obvious that Anna Biller has a real understanding of the underlying sexism of even the most ‘pro-woman’ of sexploitation films (and, really, the sexual revolution as a whole) and is using the trappings of the genre - nudist camps, eccentric artists, orgies, suburban melodrama, etc - to subvert and comment on it. The film runs a little long, but that's not much of a criticism. It's a tour- de-force in every respect and a pretty astonishing and fearless debut feature. Loved it.
Worth the watch. A bit long.
"I've always wanted to be a prostitute. It sounds so romantic!!!" Same
With its leisurely pace, it's impossible to miss how much work went into this film. To match the specific look Anna Biller and her collaborators were going for, all these period props and costumes had to be found or made. The same goes for the sets and locations. It's gorgeous to look at and filled with bare flesh, but with the presentational acting and blatant sloganeering, it's much closer to Jean-Luc Godard than Russ Meyer. Biller wants us to take something away from this film. Like Guy Maddin she's using the form of vintage media to deconstruct the artificiality of both the past and the present. You become hyper-aware of the sexism and hypocrisy that was just underneath the surface of the "free love" movement. With a Trump presidency looming, a film like Viva serves as an uneasy reminder of the "good times" red hats want to get back to.
Better than any spoof Hollywood has released in 20 years, make that 25 years (Zucker Brothers?). Oliver Stone had better bow-out and allow Anna Biller to make the Donald Trump Presidential bio-pic. She's the only one qualified to assess modern American life without resorting to a bloody sacrifice. It's like rediscovering the National Lampoon films, but womanier, sexier and smarter--skits which seem groomed not by Harvard graduates, but more seemingly Smith and the Sister schools by way of saturated cabarets on Santa Monica Boulevard and screenings at the Nuart. Somehow Viva reminds me of a melange between the work of Carol Burnett and Ulrike Ottinger. I haven't seen color like this since Technicolor I.B. prints of Tex Avery cartoons. Give her all the money in the world, just don't allow Anna Biller to stop making movies. My only complaint is that there should have been a cameo for Mary Woronov.
Checked the release date 3 times in order to be sure!
This is a very inspired, very creative flick. It was obviously made by a filmmaker who is also a cinephile. Purposefully schlocky with an eye toward feminism that is absolutely scathing to our male-dominated world. It's astounding that Biller has assembled such a large cast of people who "get it." The only downside is the length. The point is made very early on, and as much as it's more than just a novelty film, it's still a novelty film. Novelty films simply cannot fill 2 hours, which Viva struggles to do.  But as an exercise to get me pumped for The Love Witch, it's a grand success. I'll be keeping my eye on Biller. She's got the skills, the know how, and the attitude to dominate the film industry in a unique way.
That's the shit right there. Pleasure and consent 101 in a gloriously rich pastiche of 70s sexploitation. Revisits sexual politics of the 70s with a mind to disrupt our nostalgic view of the period as a free and revolutionary period for everyone involved.
Anna Biller makes me feel guilty by virtue of having been born a male. Her films practice a scorched scrotum policy as she lampoons every man as either clutching his blue balls and sulking like a whiny bitch or accusing them of being an outright rapist. Exaggerated it may seem, I wouldn't be surprised if just about every man has actually exhibited this kind of behaviour or have at least had thoughts that lie somewhere along this spectrum at one point or another. Especially through the roaring hormone fuelled years of their teens and twenties when 90% of their decisions are diverted via their penile circuitry. Hence, my own gut-wrenching guilt (on the whiny bitch end of the scale, not the rapey one). Using the aesthetic of a 70s stag film, replete with wooden acting and contrived scenarios, Anna Biller assumes the role of her lead character Barbi. Having found herself fired from her secretarial job by her ass-grabbing boss and then being walked out on by her handsome Ken-doll husband Rick, Barbi finds herself a newly liberated woman. It could not have been at a more fortunate epoch in history. By the 1970s women's liberation had reached a fever pitch and women everywhere were free to burn their bras and throw off the shackles of their patriarchal oppressors. It was a time when women could explore and express their own individual and unique identities. Right? In Viva, we see a very different picture of what that freedom amounted to. The majority of the film is focused on Barbi's picaresque adventures as she tries to find her true self. Deciding that she wants to be a model she gets passed from pillar to post in an attempt to crack into the business only to find out that with every step there is a new bridge blocked by a new troll trying a new method to convince her to crawl into the shadows with him and take off her clothes. It turns out that women's liberation is just an illusion spun by men to convert them all from housewives to whores for everyone to enjoy. To be honest I don't know if what I have written above accurately represents Anna Biller's intentions at all. I vaguely remember reading in an interview when I saw her more recent film, The Love Witch, a couple of months ago that she thought it was awful that girls were fed fantasies about chivalrous knights in shining armour on white horses sweeping them off their feet and living happily ever after only to grow up and realise that all men are basically rapists and that marriage is essentially institutional rape. I really hope that she was exaggerating just a little bit to make her point. Because if that is what it is really like to grow up a woman then that is really, really bleak and horrific. Or maybe I have incorrectly remembered what she said (and then what does that say about me?). The men in Viva form a grotesque carnival of characters. They are all so over-the-top that they almost seem to give men a way out. Nobody I know is that slimy, sleazy and lecherous, so it is quite easy for me and my friends to shrug it off and say, "Yeh, but I am not like that so I am not part of the problem" and then have a good laugh. I suspect though that Anna Biller doesn't really care whether this film makes men change or not. She has already written all of us off as assholes and she is making a movie for herself and her long suffering sisterhood. I think I better just get the fuck out of the way...! Seriously though, at the end of the day, I am in no way qualified to speak about what it is like to be a woman in this world today and/or what Anna Biller thinks about any of it. In fact, I am sure I most definitely am a part of the problem even if I think I am a nice bloke. There are probably so many things that I do and say that perpetuate gender inequality without me even realising it. After all, if women are being socialised to be oppressed, then I am being socialised to be an oppressor. I guess at the end of the day this film has got me thinking about it for a bit so maybe she is making a bit of a difference after all, one male asshole at a time.
The attention to detail in this movie is absurd and EXTREMELY impressive. Too long by about 45 minutes, but I guess that's also kind of the point.
Anna Biller is the absolute dream queen exploitation auteur. And she’s really an auteur: writing, directing, starring, designing costumes and sets, and crafting props, she works her ass off for her pictures. Viva is Biller’s first feature after years of making pastiche shorts that hearken back to the lush likes of Douglas Sirk, Mario Bava, and Herschel Gordon Lewis. Viva however is a sex comedy unlike anything since Russ Meyer. The picture follows a board housewife as she enters into a life as a prostitute, while seeking love. Viva plays like John Waters directing Belle de jour. Each scene is vibrantly colored and textured like vintage advertisements for liquor or cars or cigarettes; and each ad is directed at men. Biller subverts exploitation turning the skin flick into a statement of how women are used and lack identity in a world dominated by men. Since the '90s, cinema has had a growth in the interest in exploitation cinema of the old days (you probably know a couple of directors that have made careers out of this interest), but unlike many of the copycats and knockoffs, Biller is the real deal. One can only imagine her loosing herself for hours on end listening to the likes of Bas Sheva, gushing over old ads in Playboy, and combing LA for the gaudiest of vintage wear. Although she has made many short films, Viva was Biller’s arrival into the feature film world. It is a bold, fearless picture that will leave shag carpet burns on your skin once its done with you.
I thought Biller was going to make a parody of the sexploitation films of the 60s but no, she goes one step further and delivers a pastiche love letter for those films. Biller has an eye for the period. The costumes, the art, the colours and even the graphic design are typical of the period and the sexploitation films in particular. When Sanford and Brno sit around their pool, pour some Scotch and read Playboy, Brno announces that this is her morning coffee and news. From there on, we go on a journey of consumerism, swinging from one bed to another, caught in an idea of liberation which exists only in name. Maybe the true liberation here is the liberation from sex itself. Biller is too wooden to get the camp these films needed but otherwise she dons all her roles in this film quite well. It's a homage which refuses to go beyond the surface and give us a real critique. Yet, it is fun despite how long it is.
Smartly written.  Hilarious one-liners.  Gorgeous sets.  Brilliant.
Anna Biller's homage / pastiche / subversion of the colour-saturated softcore films of Radley Metzger and the 'nudie cuties' of the 60s and 70s has a lot more going on under the hood than mere grindhouse chic. All the pieces are in place: Self-conscious acting, burbling synth music, wooden characters with vapid dialogue, and of course a regular and healthy dollop of nudity. Break through the aesthetics though, and you can see that Biller's really taking a swipe at pretty much everything on display. From its doting, content housewives, the sleazy arrogance of its male characters, and the murky ideas of sexual revolution, it's an ickily unpleasant world that Barbie (AKA Viva) travels through on her way to, finally, some kind of self-realisation. Told straight the story would be pretty uncomfortable, but the presentation and heightened style manages to remove it to a palatable, almost fantastical realm. Some of the performers struggle to find the tone, but on the whole everyone gives it just the right amount of knowing parody, leading to some wonderfully insightful throwbacks. It's maybe a little long, but never really dull. My only regret is not being able to source a full-bodied HD version, as I'm sure it would look magnificent. Ironically the DVD is on the UK's Shameless label, which probably means they're missing the point.
Belle de Jour crossed with Confessions of a Window Cleaner. Amazing set dressing and fake product placement.
As always with Anna Biller's films, the production design of the era is completely on point, but the delivery is so one note and it doesn't have much direction making the 2 hour run time drag a whole lot - the songs don't even manage to save it at the halfway.
"I've always wanted to be a prostitute--it sounds so romantic." "You really turn me on.""I turn everybody on!" "What you're describing sounds kind of dark." "People are bored with nudity."
Femtember #16 Biller Be Brilliant. This is honestly the film about the modeling world that The Neon Demon should have been. Smart, subversive, and directed with a cleverly subtle hand. The colors pop and the performances will crack you up. The only real issue is at 2 hours the film can feel a tad on the long side. Can't wait for The Love Witch!!!
Revisionist filmmaking inside subgenres lost to the swirling vortex of TV guides from the 70's, canape cookbooks and call girl adverts. Unlocking womens sexual freedom by visiting the different aspects of sex-in-films normally male-owned paradigms and exposing their weaknesses, malevolence and buffoonery. Be your own person, alive in magic, sex and control. Gold tassles. Lemon lime patterned dresses. Vases of roses on top of gold edged cabinets. Jewel encrusted goblets. Kisses on a racing circuit. Ritualistic mondo sex parties. tiki lamps. velvet bedcovers. exotica flutes. male sex slaves. apples on a platter. anna biller isnt just a visionary. shes a weird fucking genius.
At first this film plays a little too closely as a vanity project of someone obsessed with sexploitation films of the 70's. I was waiting for it to develop jokes more overtly and parody the cliches and styles it was emulating. Really though, Anna Biller is poking fun as much as she really seems in love with the genre. For that, the film is much smarter, funnier, honest, and refreshingly earnest. It doesn't look down on the genre so much as present it as closely as the real thing, warts and all. It's a love letter and passion project, almost perfectly realized in tone, acting, writing, set, and costume design. Tongue in cheek, playful, frisky, and a little sexy. I can't think of many other films as deserving of a cult following as this. It's lovely.
A weird one this ... a film made in the last decade that for at least 20 minutes had me convinced was made forty years earlier. A tale of sexual liberation in the Swingin' Seventies told from the point of view of a woman this is authentic right down to the terrible decor and awful acting. The frequently naked lead actress is also the director and she makes a decent fist of at least one of those jobs but I'm not sure what the overall message was supposed to be.
Even after just looking at the film's posters and stills I couldn't possibly believe Viva was a 2007 movie! Then I wasn't so sure if I really wanted to watch it, but I did give it try. At the end I checked and the director Anna Biller, who also acted in her film, produced it too, and was responsible for its editing, and its production and custom design. And therefore I must say she has done a very good job with her accurate attention to details: the sets, scenarios like a nudist colony or an orgy, the clothing, the color palette used and all the rest of it manage to make Viva look totally (actually be!) alike sexploitation flicks of the 70s like any Radley Metzger's, or, say, The First Nudie Musical. Biller must have been involved even in the soundtrack selection: in the typical invasive porn OST: I could recognize some Piero Piccioni lounge-music pieces that, considering the author's mimicking rigor, I wonder whether they could be out-of-place - checking even that, I was wrong, Biller knew what she was doing! :D-. Talking about its plot, Viva is unmistakably a spoof -i.e. consider, all along its over-extended duration (2 hours!), its constant artificially mincing acting. But thanks to that, it's a bit as if the film's only aim (but could it?) is to be hilarious for its audience, the way a film like The Room is . In the end, for me Viva is so identical to the movies it sends up (only longer :D), that it's as bad as them.
Anna Biller's candy-colored sexploitation fever dream is about as smart, sexy, and consistently hilarious as feature debuts get; equal parts powerful call to action and ambitious love letter with a fetishistic attention to detail.

I recently heard about Anna Biller's new film The Love Witch, which sounds really good, so in lieu of that coming out, I thought I would try her previous feature Viva. Viva is a sexploitation film, from a feminist perspective, that alternates at being hilarious and being so committed to its premise that it becomes dulling. The film is parody in the best way, it has its own story to tell and narrative to follow, but it distinctly wrought in the style it was conceived. The film is Douglas Sirk and Jacque Demy sets, with Russ Meyer or Radley Metzger plotting. It is hilariously acted, arch dialogue delivered absolutely flatly; and while there is a lot of nudity, there is limited sex. Most of the sleaze is limited to elaborate early-'70s pastiche clothing and amusing scenarios. Though, Biller does manage to shoehorn in a sequence at a nudist colony... The film ends with an orgy. Where a musical number is sung. That is the tone throughout. In fact, the film becomes a musical about one-hour in. The characters singing is completely out of the blue and really invigorates the second half. The only issue I had with Anna Biller's film is that at 120 minutes, it is incredibly long. It should never have been near two hours. It becomes a little tiresome before the end, even when there are really good individual scenes in the second half. However, you have to applaud Biller. She acts in it (amusingly), directs it (artistically), writes it (archly). But she also produced it, edited it, was the production designer, was involved in the music and she was the costume designer. She also worked in the art department and did the short animation sequence! It really is an auteurist vision of the clearest sort. Viva is a funny, if really overlong, parodic sexploitation musical. It makes me more interested in seeing The Love Witch as soon as possible.
Anna Biller’s melange of supremely crafted cinematic period detail and the genuinely captivating story of Barbie/Viva’s journey through a very particular swinging 60’s cinescape is the work of a unique artist doing something quite fascinating, but also very entertaining with the aesthetics of genre cinema. Of course Viva is hilarious and humour plays a large part given the form and tropes which Biller uses to tell her tale. But what’s fascinating is the level of authentic detail in conjuring up a world that never existed beyond the screen. The vision is authentic, yet only tenuously related to reality. Yet this is no facile ‘wink-wink’ retro homage. Nothing is for purely superficial effect and Barbie/Viva’s journey is broached in a manner unlikely during the cinematic period that the film is harking back to, yet the specific tropes alluded to and the detail employed creates in conjunction with the modern telling of the story something quite wonderfully singular. Of course in an actual b-movie about swinging and wild parties in 60’s America the housewife who dared to step outside of her suburban hausfrau role would inevitably be punished by 'fate' come the end credits! Anna Biller (with her seemingly ever present blue eye shadow!) is excellent as both hemmed in housewife Barbie and Goddess Viva. Bathing is simply impossible without drinking and smoking at the same time. I loved the very Beyond the Valley of the Dolls looking party/orgy scene and Viva’s siren song is awesome and so is the animated interlude. I’m now really looking forward to seeing Biller’s new film The Love Witch at Frightfest!
It's like a bunch of Greek gods hosted a feast during which they consumed a lot of wine, and a lot of pineapple, and everything I love about movies and also every movie I love, and then had this massive orgy, and they ejaculated this all over my heart and soul.
Hilarious 70'ies sexcomedy about the so-called sexual revolution in California, unfortunately only for men. Told from the viewpoint of two housewives. Entertaining to the end.
a wonderfully colour film. on a side note, i appreciated how the film distinguished between the consensual sex scenes (fading out before the act) and the rape scenes (not fading out and showing the act). I have to remove half a star for Mark's fucking GRATING, fucking DECIMATING, fucking SOUL CRUSHINGLY repetitive laugh. That laugh alone made me want to turn the film off and end my life (more than usual). Luckily, it goes away after the first fifteen minutes or so. I'm almost happy I spent $31.50 on this EX-RENTAL dvd... Now I'm definitely looking forward to seeing The Love Witch at MIFF next month :)
Anna Biller is making the films of my dreams and, as utterly amusing as this movie is, you can tell she takes all of her influences seriously and approaches them with genuine love instead of ironic kitsch. It makes a world of difference, resulting in one of the best tributes to the greats of the sexploitation era (Metzger and Meyer among others) because it works on three levels: as a tribute to them, as a subtle critique of them, and as a film that would fit in beautifully alongside them.
More pain-staking homage than loosey-goosey parody, and that makes all the difference. You can see so much care, and knowledge here. I was afraid this would just be a slapdash, goofy one-note joke. But man, this is fun. A bit long, but still.
a women’s picture thriving within an homage to a genre (sexploitation) that is often exploitative of women; and that’s exactly the point. takes place during the sexual revolution in the ‘70s – which it theoretically praises, but more importantly, acknowledges that many (mainly men, unsurprisingly) took advantage of it – and allows its female protagonist’s sexual desires and curiosities to run wild in a Sirkian journey through a wide array of then-taboo subject matter. vitally sidesteps a mere winky parody, instead showing both an appreciation and understanding of the genre: the colorful production design and meticulously stilted dialogue alone place this miles ahead of the genre’s countless phony homages, but it additionally derives humor from the absurdity of the era while integrating the genuinely apt ambience of the genre and Biller's own personally idiosyncratic approach.
A thoroughly entertaining and colourful film, which is a sort of homage to the sexploitation movies of the late sixties and seventies. Anna Biller, who also wrote and directed it, stars as the main character Barbi AKA Viva. In what has been called a "post-feminist 70's era B flick exploitation homage film" . Everyone gives these rather amateurish performances as they strut around in bright 70s clothes and mainly dodgy wigs. The films' that it plagiarizes i haven't seen! For me it was like a more sedate and less edited Russ Meyer movie! After reading interviews with Anna Biller, she doesn't even mention Meyer but interestingly enough she does mention Peter Walker, who made some British sex comedies in the early 70s. But this film does remind me of Candy (1968) with it's lecherous men lusting after the main lead and none of them really have any redeeming features. It is all made in a studio and the sets are matched with the costumes the actors wear. It does look like an animated Play Boy magazine from the 1970s. Anna Biller pouts and flutters her eye leashes as her neighbor Rick (Chad England), falsely laughs loudly at his rather pointless 'jokes'. She has a some what Tura Satana look to her but her character isn't as strong in stature. There is a number of songs sang by the three main protagonists and even a psychedelic cartoon with some symbolic apples! There is lots of nudity, but these people look real and from this period of time, so that is nicely suitable for the retro feel of the film. There isn't any plastic implanted breast or men posing, showing off six packs. It does oddly and subtly 'comment' on the use of drugging people for sex which happens twice in this film. Also she is raped and then acts like nothing happen and if the act was her doing as if this is a part of her discovering and reveling in her sexuality. Lots of odious hippies who use their mantra of free love, just to get laid and all the artistic men are English and very sleazy. There is a Kenneth Tynan type character who is staging a nude stage musical too. The version i saw was the 18 rated DVD or the un-rated American version, which was a little too long and somewhat dragged in places. But all that said and done, it was very enjoyable for the detail in the set design, make up and costumes and silliness of the characters.
What starts out as fairly boring and irritating, slowly comes in to focus and ends up being ok. It is a bit ridiculous and the fake laughing gets very annoying, but overall it is actually well-made and makes its point subtly.
Not gonna lie -- this was hilarious. Loved it.
And just like that, I was all caught up on the films of Sam Bologna.
Uh, happy Women History Month? :/
Sexual freedom can also mean freedom from sex. So this is one of these pastiche movies, but unlike say Black Dynamite (to pick a beloved movie that I love to hate), there's never the sense that Anna Biller (writer/director/editor/star/costume and set designer) is making fun of the set of movies to which VIVA is pointing (Joe Sarno sin-in-the-suburbs sexploitation, nudist camp quickies, Radley Metzger high society sleaze, Beyond the Valley of the Dolls, etc). Instead this movie wears their artifice as a deliberate way of calling attention to the bogus "freedoms" and "liberated attitudes" of an era that still prioritized men's desires and objectified women. There's still plenty of "that's so 70s!" goofin' and the cadence of the stilted dialogue, while period accurate, gets a bit thin after 120 minutes, but this is generally a smart, thoughtful use of imagery and tropes that works simultaneously as a celebration and a deconstruction.
Sirk/Metzger/Meyer/Waters I don't even fucking know. Where has this been all my life?
I always like when a film doesn't attempt to completely destroy the tropes of what came before, but fully embraces them while subtly poking at their issues. That being said, I think this film might offend some people as it is wholeheartedly 1960's nudie cutie as the Editor is 1970s Giallo. So the film has a completely different outlook on the world when compared to more modern ones. At its heart, this is the story of a woman named Barbie who's marriage falls apart and winds up becoming a call girl named Viva, and chronicling the adventures (and frankly surprising number of rapes) she encounters on her way. A number of the people situations she deals with are quite funny, and all of them are quite strange. Most of the film is Barbie/Viva wandering ahead and getting into some sort of odd situation, almost like a screwball comedy style plot. Biller is the only director who I feel is up to par with Wes Anderson on set decoration and design. Everything from costume to random junk sitting around either is or looks vintage. There is some absolutely brilliant mid century design evident in this film. I'm personally most partial to the overly sleazy den of the artist, as well as several of the outfits Barbie has. The best is one that appears to be a dress where the top is crocheted. It really doesn't get more 1970 than that. With the current growing interests in the 70's, I wouldn't be surprised if this one has a gain in popularity after The Love Witch comes out. I feel really sorry for the guys playing the husbands for having to eat the mid century party food. Also I'm a little worried about some of the bit actors. They did so well with the mannerisms and movements of film characters from the period that I just can't help but feel they watch way too many of them. Its a lot of fun. By the way, I watched the unrated version. There is only one sex scene in it, and the majority of the nudity is in the scene at the nudist camp. So for those where that would be a turn off don't need to overly worry. If you can make it through opening the dvd without being offended you'll be fine...  *******A few minor spoilers here*********** To me, the film is a view of the issues of the past. Barbie's path is never much in doubt, and much of what happens to her is based on her gender. As much as she wants to be a truly liberated woman, when it gets beyond sex there is no place for her in the world. Towards the end, she even learns that she was all alone in her actions, that the women she thought shared her lifestyle do not. It simply wasn't proper. There is a scene late in the film that would seem to cement in this reading. In it one of the various sleazy characters addresses the camera about the role of men in the world. He talks about how great everything is, and how one day all of this will change. Even the men in the film know that the way things were could not stay forever. Viva just appeared a little too early, and allowed the wrong people to think for her. This film is almost a swan song for the age before feminism. It shows how even when a woman tried, she could never fully escape the control of men. Watching this film is an insight into an earlier, almost unfathomable age. Viewing it as such, this could be one of the most anti-nostalgia nostalgia films I have seen. It shows that it is possible to recreate the past, but also asks the question of why? And at the same time its a funny mid century sex comedy. With better acting than some of the movies from the period. Now I'm REALLY looking forward to the Love Witch.  (One final note, its a very un-sexy sex film, which reminds me of Guilty of Romance. I think there is something to a comparison of these films, and they would make an excellent double feature. here is so much to unpack in both of these films and they follow a similar plot line. Even though one is technically a comedy and the other is a Sion Shono film.)
This film is so good yet I'm sure there will be many unable to truly enjoy it as I have (and will again) because of its daring and its honesty and to be honest its historical setting. Anna Biller has brilliantly and lovingly created an homage (with feminist overtones) to late 60s/early 70s sexploitation. She stars, a little uncomfortably, it has to be said, though this works for the film, and even disrobes for her art. The set designs, the art on the walls and even an animated sequence (brilliant) are all her own work and stunning it all is. This looks, sounds and feels like a product of the time and I can understand youngsters just finding it all funny but for me it is like stepping into a very knowing time capsule and entering a very thoughtful look as what appears so trivial. There is much nudity, much wooden acting, truck loads of bright and garish colours and lots of limp dialogue vaguely pontificating a world seemingly changing forever but in reality a speck, an aberration, a unique moment in time, perfectly captured. Enjoy if you dare!
Written, directed and starring Anna Biller, "Viva" comes across as a lost sexploitation flick from the early '70s despite it being produced in 2007. Biller based the incredible, psychedelic look of "Viva" on late '60s decorating books and Playboy magazine to come up with a fabulously distinctive, eye-popping film where the design, clothes and colour are an integral part of the story and the story-telling. Biller plays Barbi, a bored housewife in 1972 suburbia who is married to Mark (Jared Sanford) and is close friends with neighbours Sheila (Bridget Brno) and Rick (Chad England). When Mark abandons Barbi at home to go off on a business / leisure trip, Barbi and Sheila decide its time to get rid of their bras and head out on the town in search of excitement and the sexual revolution. Barbi, who rechristens herself Viva ("I want to be called Viva, which in Italy means "to live." Because that's what I want to do now - to live!"), quickly finds herself swept into an orgiastic maelstrom of sex, hippies, nudist camps, drugs, orgies, bisexuality and general bohemian decadence. Anna Biller's film is a magnificent, subversive and satirical exploration of gender issues and female empowerment within the context of an brilliantly constructed sexploitation film, making the resulting film possibly a one-of-a-kind feminist sexploitation movie. Biller explores the differences between the needs and desires of women and men and subtly portrays issues of gender conflict. She stabs at the gender imbalance that was inherent within the "sexual revolution"; her dialogue demonstrating these issues is both clever and pointed. Rick's monologue, straight to camera, is a great case in point: "There's never been a better time to be a man. The willing women. The dandy clothes. The frills. The big rings and jewellery. The open shirts. The sense of entitlement. Take it from me: savour this time. For it will soon be gone, never to return". The acting is excellent throughout, it's strange slightly hysterical pitching adding to the surreal allure of the film. Overall "Viva" is one of the best film's I've seen in a while. It's stunning look, design and vibrant colour palette being the base on which Anna Biller has built a brilliant b-movie sexploitation pastiche and parody. It is more than simply parody, however, being also a story of self-awareness, sexual discovery and gender politics. That Biller has managed so effectively to combine a stunningly accurate sexploitation homage and imbue it with a satirical, subversive, intellectual feminist edge is a remarkable achievement.
Very dull, mostly just a series of unfunny stereotypes. this has been referred to as a "feminist" film, but Barbie is such a weak gullible lead, that you would find stronger female characters in a Russ Meyer films, or actual 70's exploitation flicks. Also the amount of fake laughter is so tiresome, I understand it is supposed to be a parody as the 70's was chalked full of unnecessary laughter, but it really is not funny. piss poor attempt at pseudo nostalgia for the golden era of cinema. This required a lot of patience to get through.
Now this is the quirky feminist director people should be putting on a pedestal instead of Lena Dunham. One posits a female point of view while naked and snarling, lampooning the male’s place in society but in a way that refuses to be civil, pointing one finger while clenching the rest. If you disagree, it’s because you’re sexist. And the other one says the same thing but knows how to have fun and utilize her talent in a non-aggressive way. You know, maybe we can talk about this kind of stuff and not get into a fight. Guess which one people take more seriously. Nepotism makes a world of difference, it seems. The skilled Anna Biller, however, is a breath of fresh air. Someone who can direct, edit, produce, write, make the costumes and sets for (both of which are impeccable, btw), animate and compose songs for, and star in a sexploitation movie in the 21st century, giving us a Boogie Nights with less plotholes and purposeful bad acting (just being honest); someone who is able make a piece of art and have it speak for itself without self-aggrandizing and taking the war to Twitter - simply "this is the movie, this is the statement, enjoy it or don’t, hi mom" - is someone we should have more respect for and I feel ashamed that I’ve only just now stumbled upon her. Instead of mumbling that there’s nothing new to try so let’s just Frances Ha, she gives us Viva, a movie so stylish and saturated in 1972 gaudiness, complete with flowery game-show jazz soundtrack and intensely bright set design, that you forget it was made in 2007. Why has it been 7 years and we’ve not given her carte blanche to make whatever the hell she wants yet? Taking a break from the discussion portion of the class, is it a perfect movie? By no means. But I’m in awe of a person who knows how to make a movie feel good, where the only glaring flaw I can think of off the top of my head is that it runs a bit too long. Maybe it doesn't say enough but I wouldn't consider that a flaw because, as a moviegoer, I need to remind myself that I'm not entitled to a script that says what I'm thinking. When someone gets close enough, though, I'm willing to rate it higher out of respect.
Satire? Homage? Recreation? VIVA does a remarkable job recreating the look and much of the style of 70s sexploitation movies. At an hour it might have been a fun little homage to the genre. Going on and on for two hours, it creates a rather dystopian story of free love. Cool music.
Entertaining....even if I'm not 100% sure what I just watched. Purposely bad acting and great costume and set design. Enough nudity and a variety of sex to keep most males engaged. I could of done without the constant jazzy background music, however.
Although it gets more of a rating than some of the dross I've seen, it's mainly for the set design and costumes. The performances are intentionally wooden in a Victoria Wood's 'Acorn Antiques' fashion with a plot and script to match. This is troublesome partly because the cast are completely unknown so you're never sure whether they're putting on this performance or if they're genuinely this wooden. This level of spoofery backfires horribly unfortunately due to these shortcomings and it gets incredibly tiring to watch without checking the time.
Good for what it is. Radley Metzger meets John Waters badly acted hokey sexploitation period film. Nostalgic cinephiles should enjoy this brightly colored farce.
Overlong and preserved in aspic it may be, this is worth watching just for the irrepressible performance of Jared Sanford; I salute you with a Dewars on the rocks, you magnificently crazed sleazy bastard. Strictly for the cognoscenti, but Biller may be one to watch in the future. (Review by Jason Abbey) www.themoviewaffler.com/2014/02/dvd-review-viva-2007.html
If you're a fan of sexploitation films from the 1960's, Viva is perfect for you! A throwback to these films in a similar way to Death Proof/Planet Terror, Hobo With A Shotgun and Black Dynamite but with a strong focus on the cheeky sex films of the time. If you're a fan of films from directors such as Russ Meyer (particularly SuperVixens), sexploitation and throwback movies then you should definetly check this one out. It recieved some fantastic reviews from critics upon it's release and I totally agree with it. A great fun film that pays homage to the rather cheeky films of the 60s.
I don't know whether to laugh at the camp and self-deprecation of Anna Biller or marvel at her simply amazing retro styling. Every prop, every shot, every plot point, even the food served, is so convincing it's hard to remember it was made this century.
visually perfect reproduction of 1970' kitch, acting was toooooo forced which was not funny after the first 3 minutes
