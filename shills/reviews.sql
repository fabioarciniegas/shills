Based on its reputation as a piece of work heavily compromised by the censorship of the time, I went in with rather measured expectations, all of which were exceeded. Honestly, the final product doesn''t feel very compromised; yes, it''s a bit less explicit about things every now and then, but Nabokov was never gratuitous about his subject matter in the first place, and Kubrick''s ingenious approach to this material is to play it just like a normal Hollywood movie from the era of the Hayes code, complete with (gorgeous) black and white and a sweeping (also gorgeous) musical score, as if blithely ignorant of the perversity of what he''s portraying. The first hour or so, in particular, is just excellent, a funhouse mirror screwball comedy only slightly more fast-paced, laden with innuendo,* and demented than, say, Bringing Up Baby or His Girl Friday. Shelley Winters plays the same character she always plays, but dials it up to 11, and the result is glorious; James Mason is brilliant as ever, in a role that finally (along with Bigger Than Life) gives his talents the showcase they deserve. The second hour of the film loses some of that energy, and not all of the digressions involving Peter Sellers'' character are so compelling, but the film fully regains its power by the last half hour. If Lolita starts off as a parody of the American cinema of the ''30s and ''40s, it ends with a terribly sad slow-motion disintegration into alienation and loneliness that recalls the best cinema of the decades that followed. *CHARLOTTE: "Hum, you just touch me and I...

INSERT INTO evaluate_review VALUES(129,8.0,'Super Hard of Hearing A couple of days before I left for a 2011 road trip to Alaska, I watched, for the umpteenth time, Superman (1978), this time on a shiny new Blu-Ray. The high-definition picture was astounding, but so was the audio - so much so that the crystal-clear sound cleared up a decades-old personal mystery. Midway through the film, Lois Lane interviews Superman about his past, his politics, and his powers. One exchange goes something like this: "Is it true you can see through anything?" "Well, pretty much, yes." She asks a couple more questions before suddenly switching gears: "What colour underwear am I wearing?" "Hmmm," Superman says. "Oh, I''ve embarrassed you." "No not at all, it''s just that this fabric must be made of lead," Superman says, pointing. "I have a little trouble seeing through lead." This line has puzzled me for years. Are there fabrics that use lead fiber? The questions continue. A couple of seconds later, Superman says "Pink." "Excuse me?" Lois asks. "Pink," Superman says, pointing at her hips. For decades, I figured this meant that Superman could eventually see through lead, if he tried hard enough, or that there was sufficiently little lead in the fabric of Lois'' dress that his x-ray vision eventually penetrated it. But that''s not what happens. In fact, Superman says not "This fabric must be made of lead," but "This planter must be made out of lead." There''s a lead planter standing between Superman and Lois. And sure enough, right at the moment Lois moves into a position where the planter isn''t blocking Superman''s sightlines, that''s when he says "Pink." Lead fabric, lead planter. It''s a silly little piece of trivia, to be sure, but this issue has nagged at me for years. What a relief to have high fidelity audio clear up the matter.',7);

INSERT INTO evaluate_review VALUES(134,9.0,'In 1989, inspired by Alan Moore''s "The Killing Joke" and Frank Miller''s "The Dark knight returns", Tim Burton took Batman back into mainstream popular culture, setting the stage for the late 90s/Early 2000s Superhero films like Blade, X-Men and Spider-Man which in turn paved the way for the MCU and the DCEU. It also inspired "Batman: The Animated Series" (which actually came out the same year as the sequel "Batman Returns") which became one of the most popular cartoons of all time and later expanded into the DC Animated Universe with several spin-off/sequel series. Let me discuss the basic plot and premise: Batman is Gotham City''s protector, but seems to be just a mysterious rumor among the criminal underworld of the city. However, we, the cops and the criminals quickly find out he''s very real. Batman also has a double life as the wealthy socialite Bruce Wayne, hosting a party and inviting tons of people including Vicki Vale. Batman accidentally knocks the criminal Jack Napier into a vat of chemicals at the AXIS Chemicals company plant, transforming Jack into the insane Joker. Meanwhile, both Batman and Bruce Wayne are investigated by the female reporter Vicki Vale. The Joker puts poisons in various products to kill off Gotham''s population, and its up to Batman to stop the Joker and his minions. Tim Burton''s Batman is a fun, dark yet stylized (or even camp) take on the Batman mythos. The anachronistic Gotham, mixing retro 1940s-style aesthetics with modern sensibilities and other elements thrown in too. Other adaptations followed suit, such as the animated series, and it continues to influence batman media even today. The special effects for the various vehicles such as the Batmobile and Batplane and the Joker''s helicopter and Parade float are well-done and hold up to today''s standards. Batman''s latex costume, whilst it did make hard to move his neck, is well-designed and still holds up today, and the Joker''s costume is also well-design. Speaking of, let''s discuss the two stars of the film. Michael Keaton is excellent as both the suave and secretive Bruce Wayne and the ruthless Batman. He has some great lines like "I''m Batman" and "you wanna get nuts? Lets get nuts!". He diverges from the comics in being more willing to kill opponents, but most of the time it seems to be in self-defence as his opponents try to kill him first. Jack Nicholson''s Joker is also very enjoyable as a despicable, comical but deadly figure and he''s also good as Jack Napier, the Joker''s sane former self. Jack Napier is also who killed Batman''s parents, giving them a deeper reason for their rivalry. Whilst some prefer Batman''s killer to be unknown and ambiguous making his quest seem more endless, I can see why they simplified it for the film. Joker''s death is a very well-done and memorable scene and one of the most iconic super-villain defeats in film. Kim Basinger''s Vicki Vale is also very likeable as an investigate and curious reporter, even if she does end up a bit damsel-in-distress-esque at times. Pat Hingle''s Comissioner Gordon is also very convincing and heroic as the upstanding leader of the police forces. Billy Dee Williams is excellent as the heroic Harvey Dent before he becomes Two-Face (and also Tommy Lee Jones; Williams only signed for a single film). The rest of the supporting cast does a good job, but the Joker and Batman drive the film. Batman is a great take on an iconic superhero and I think fans of modern superhero films will enjoy it. It may not have the same budget or SFX that can compete with modern films, but it has creativity, grit and charm, and without it most modern superhero films wouldn''t exist.

INSERT INTO evaluate_review VALUES(141,6.0,'BATMAN (1989) "The Dark Knight of Gotham City begins his war on crime with his first major enemy being the clownishly homicidal Joker." The Superman franchise was a big hit for Warner Bros. back in the 1980''s, so it was only appropriate for them to make a major studio screen adaptation for the ''World''s Smartest Detective.'' Batman hit theaters in June 1989, and upon release received mostly positive reviews, plus a welcoming box office financial success. Director Tim Burton made one of the more stylish, dark and brooding comic to cinema adaptations, injecting film noir tones into the atmosphere of the movie and heavy German Expressionism influences in the set designs of Gotham City. The backlot sets and fictional architecture of Gotham City seems to reflect upon 1920''s German silent films, having strange contrasting buildings, with jutting towers seemingly spruced about everywhere. The enticing production design aside, I found Michael Keaton''s portrayal of Batman/Bruce Wayne pretty good; he makes for better acting when he''s underneath the caped crusader''s cowl, but his Bruce Wayne is decent enough, if not forcefully eccentric. It just doesn''t come off natural that he''s this billionaire playboy by day. Jack Nicholson on the other hand makes for a wonderful Joker at times, with zany one-liners and pun-induced joke weapons employed at his disposal. Again, the issue lies in his alter ego, which unfortunately, The Joker in this movie has. Jack Napier is The Joker''s real name in the movie, his backstory being he was a rising petty criminal turned mobster who got transformed into The Joker after accidentally falling into a vat of chemicals while evading and fighting Batman at the Axis Chemical plant. He also was responsible for the murder of Bruce Wayne''s parents. While I did enjoy this ''you created me, I created you'' approach that eventually leads to the infamous ''duel of the freaks'' scene, I wasn''t so much a fan of The Joker''s backstory being revealed. One of the best things about the character of The Joker is his character, including his motivations, is shrouded in mystery. The unknown factor behind his madness is key, but alas we don''t get that here. The special effects for the time are good along with the gadgetry of Batman and some of the choreographed fight scenes. The musical score by Danny Elfman is iconic and mesmerizing. And the heavily dark overtone is much appreciated. But the movie has faults too, applying misplaced humor at times into the dark mix being one of them. I also didn''t care for any of the Prince contributed songs that play in the film; they just feel really out of place in a Batman flick. The character of Vicki Vale (portrayed by Kim Basinger) should have been omitted entirely. And there''s some dry patches during the runtime, evoking a sense of an unintended dragging pace. But overall Batman is still kind of fun to check out, certainly better than the last couple of sequels it has.',8);

The order is more or less as well though out and comprehensible as the plot of the film. - In the opening shot, the black text at the bottom of the screen establishing the location slides over a patch of black/brown ground and immediately is unreadable. The editing in general is so incomprehensible that you can''t really understand it until you see it. - Whoever has the power to ban Jared Leto from life, can they please do so. He occasionally barges into the plot for no apparent reason. At one point he lies on the ground surrounded by various weapons and children''s clothing. LOL SO RANDOM... He seems to be doing a bad heath ledger impersonation which has the side effect of making him incomprehensible at points. Possibly this inadvertently improves the film - It takes about 40 minutes, nearly a third of the runtime, just on the opening exposition dump and setting up the members/plot. It could pretty much have started 40 minutes in and nothing changes. - The suicide squad helicopter gets shot down by gunfire, but I cannot for the life of me work out who did it. I think enchantress and her brother were the only people who were threats in the city at the time, who don''t use guns. Whoever did it seems to just vanish into the night. - During a firefight, someone seems to be firing a laser gun. Who has this, how and why I cannot work out. Its bizzare. It shows up at various other times as well but you can never see where it comes from. Later some random person in a helicopter uses a laser gatling thing - a helicopter which definitely wasn''t there any other time. -Conceptually the entire thing is stupid right off the bat. For some inexplicable reason, the government decides that to assemble a squad that can take on superman if he turned evil, or another similar threat occurred. They then filled this squad almost entirely of regular human people. Unless superman has a crippling fear of boomerangs, I doubt they''ll go far. Katana is probably the one character who''s actually pretty cool. She has a handful of lines, some of which are in Japanese and underrated. This is a criminal misuse of a character whose sword sucks in the souls of people she kills. Criminal. - People seem to just do random things in this film for no apparent reason. - At least killer Croc has a positive body image about himself?

Filmi izlemeden önce gerçekten beklentim yoktu çünkü film çıkalı 2 ay oldu ve bende fazla spoiler almamaya çalıştığım için beklentim düştü. Şimdi sizlere bu ekipten bahsetmek istiyorum. Amerikan Hükümeti her türlü tehdite karşı bir ekip toplamak ister, bunlar dünyanın en kötü ve psikopat insanlarıdır. Ve olan olur Midway City''de gerçekleşen olaydan sonra hükümet bu ekibi toplamaya başlar. Şimdi bu kısmı anladıysanız benim kendi görüşlerime gelelim. Ben bu filmi beğendim bkz: beğendim. Oyunculuklar olsun, müzik olsun ve Batman ve Flash''ın görünmesi olsun hepsi güzel detaylardı. Benim takıldığım noktalar ise bence bu filmin düşmanı hiç olmamış, tamam Enchantress güçlü bir kötü ama bu düşmanın hikayede bir derinliği yok ki, Enchantress kim ki?, yada kardeşi bunlar kim?, birden çıka geliyorlar. Enchantress kardeşini uyandırıyor ve dünyanın altını üstünü ediyorlar onlarında her kötü gibi amaçları dünyayı ele geçirmek. Örn: General Zod''un bir derinliği ve karakter iç güdüsü vardı. Ama burda ise biz bir iki düşman koyalım birde üstüne bir origin yapalım olsun film havası var. Çoğu kişinin dediği gibi bir filmde düşman iyi işlenmemiş ise o film kötüdür, evet bu doğru bir görüş bunu her yerde gördük. Örn: Avengers: Age of Ultron, Ultron patates gibi bir kötüydü. Demek istediğim filmin zaten düşmana ihtiyacı yoktu. Örn: Film bir pasta ise bu filme düşman eklemek sos kalır. Gelelim 2. probleme, bakıyorumda karakterler dünyada felan hep ''''Kötününde Kötüsü'''' olarak lanse edildi. Ben filmi izlediğimde bu adamlar nasıl düşman dedim içimdem. Yav kardeşim siz kötüsünüz tamam belki kötü olursanız izleyenler sizden nefret etçek ama insan birazda mı ''''Kötü'''' algısı bırakmaz bu karakterlerde, Arkham serilerini oynamış biri olarak söylüyorum bu karakterler hiç böyle değil, filmde Harley Quinn, Deadshot, El Diablo gibi karakterlere hep bir insanlık katmaya çalışmışlar, tamam kötü yapında bu adamlar Batman''in düşmanı mı acaba, ondan emin değilim. Valla Deadshot Batman''in yanında böyle davransın Batman onu Robin yapar. Filmin ikinci sıkıntısı bu karakterlerin ''''Kötü'''' oldukları kısmını filme iyi aktaramamışlar. Üçüncü sıkıntı ise, ben açık ve net söylüyorum ben Will Smith''in Deadshot''u olması hoşuma gitmedi, neden mi? bu adamın zaten bir sürü Drama filmi var ben bu adama baktığımda kötü göremiyorum kardeşim, bu nasıl Deadshot oyunlarda Batman''in düşmanlarından biri ama burda bildiğin melek. Batman ile kapıştığı esnada adama acıdım o kadar. Birde maske olayı var, Deadshot''ın o ünlü maskesini çok az giymesi canımı sıktı, mağdem bu karakteri iyi işlemek istediniz neden Will Smith''i seçtiniz, adam Maske giymiyor desem yeridir buda sırf yüzü görünsün ve hasılat yapsın diye. Valla hiç bana kızmayın Will Smith''i bu filme para hiç getirmediyseler beni burada boğun yani o kadar eminim. Margot Robbie beğendim ilk başta ön yargılarım vardı ama gerçekten iyi oynamış. Joker''e gelirsek, bu adamın bu filmde ne işi var tamam Harley bulmak istiyor ama bi Enchantress bi Joker aklım karıştı. Birde adamı ikinci röle yazmışlar. Joker ve Harley ilişkisinin o kadar derin ve ihtişamlı anlatılmamış. Ben aralarındaki ilişkide bir derinlik göremedim doğrusu. Filmin evren ile alakalı olması beni sevindirdi DC''de böyle şeyler görmek beni gerçekten mutlu etti. Filmi Deadshot ve Harley Quinn taşıdı diyebiliriz. Müzikler çok iyidi. Görsel efeklerde iyidi ama bütçe neden bu kadar çok demedi değilim yani. Yanlız onca sözden sonra gerçekten DC filmlerinde gelişme olduğunu fark ettim. BvS ile kıyaslamak gerekirse BvS daha iyi ama bu filmde karakterler bakımında gayet eğlenceli bir film olduğunu söylebilirim. Kesilen sahneleri BvS''de olduğu gibi fark etmedim film aktı yani. DC''nin gelecek filmlerini merakla bekliyorum. Bu arada Extended Cut versiyonuda Blu-Ray''de gelmesi beni sevindirdi. Sizlere tavsiyem filmi izleyin ama çerezlik ve mantık hataları olduğunu bilin. İyi Seyirler...”',9);

The films strengths lies in its performances and for the part, it certainly distracts you from the films weaker elements. The film’s low point is the fact that they use modern music in the soundtrack, which is a bit off putting, but mainly due to Ricci’s performance, the film succeeds more than it should the film manages to be a well acted affair with a good script, but if they would tighten a few areas and have changed the soundtrack to a more period oriented score, then maybe the film would have been much better.

There were also a few dumb scenes, such as Harley commiting a THEFT right in front of a MILITARY OFFICER. The pacing was kind of off at the beginning, with like 10 whole minutes giving all the characters (except Slipknot) hype videos as if it was a Smash Bros Game. Killer Croc''s character would have been better off not speaking at all. I couldn''t understand a word he said. Also, how come NONE of the good metahumans out there took any interest in what was going on? Alright, now for the good stuff. First, the whole premise is actually very interesting. I''m usually not a big fan of movies with a villain as the protagonist, especially superhero movies, because they''re always going to "turn good" and be redeemed, which is the opposite of the point of having villains. But they change it up here. Instead of fighting the bad guy, they''re being forced by THE GOVERNMENT to do it. Even if characters like Harley and El Diablo had "redeeming moments", they still remain bad guys, and are still thought of by the public as villains. DC doesn''t get enough credit for having more original stories. Second, the characters are interesting. The ones that are important to the story (so, everyone but Slipknot) is given just enough backstory to allow the audience to understand and feel for the characters, while still thinking of them as "bad guys". Third, the action. Seeing bad guys fight faceless CGI army men for a good cause, while still being bad guys is an awesome thing to see. The effects and makeup were very good (even Oscar-worthy). Also, I loved how they added in cameos from Batman and the Flash, (whom this was his first real appearance on screen). It didn''t feel shoehorned in. Finally, I don''t understand the hate that Jared Leto''s Joker gets. Yeah, his performance isn''t as good as Ledger''s but you''ll never get him back (RIP). Get over it. Leto''s performance isn''t bad. It''s actually quite good for what it is. What is it?, you may ask. Well, Nicholson''s Joker was basically a mob-boss who had a few screws loose, but still had his wits. Ledger''s Joker was a full-on psycho who THOUGHT he was perfectly sane. (I''m not even gonna mention Romero). I like to think that Leto is playing a mix between the two. He''s definitely a mob boss, and he knows exactly what he''s doing, but he''s also has a very messed up head. I think the film would have benefited greatly from more of him. I hope they do more with him in the future. Oh, and I think the film should have taken place at Arkham Aylum. You''ve got big, well-known villains like Harley Quinn, Killer Croc, and Deadshot being kept at a PENITENTIARY instead of an INSANSE ASYLUM. So yeah. It''s not perfect, but it''s enjoyable. I don''t think it was ever supposed to be a "good" film, but it does NOT deserve all the hate it gets.',9);

''Lizzie Borden Took an Ax'', was nothing of what I expected, other than starring Ricci. This isn''t always a bad thing, but I couldn''t have strayed further from the mark, with the film being a mixture of courtroom drama, thriller and true crime. Lizzie Borden Took an Ax, is a very perplexing film. Not only is it masquerading as an interesting take on an original American true crime, but it is a period costume drama. It is a film that follows our titular villain, as she massacres her family, yet manages to show a certain decorum, that fools her erstwhile prosecutors, and her family and friends. We see the whole bloody ordeal, transposed through witnesses accounts in the docks, yet never seeing the true picture. This is one aspect that flourishes, in Ricci''s dead pan portrayal of Borden. She is cool, calculating and despicable throughout the entirety, yet carries a certain standing, that no one could ever believe her capable of a sinister crime. Although nothing I was expecting, Lizzie Borden Took an Ax was a treat. It had spectacular scenery and period costumes that transformed it''s settings. It also had some brilliant turns in leading roles. It just wasn''t anything either riveting or compelling.

The main characters are all likeable, and the story is really good. I always really enjoy the part where they introduce the members of the Suicide Squad. The soundtrack is also mostly really good. Any soundtrack that has Queen and Kanye West is going to be awesome. One thing I was thinking about while watching this was that I really like the CGI in the DCEU films. It has a kind of unique style that I really like, and it looks a lot more interesting than the CGI in most other superhero films.

INSERT INTO evaluate_review VALUES(239,7.0,'REVIEW zu SUICIDE SQUAD: Nachdem es bereits im März zum großen aufeinandertreffen zwischen den beiden Superhelden-Ikonen Batman und Superman kam, schickt DC (Verlag) nun seine nächsten „Helden“ ins Rennen um den Thron am Comicverfilmungshimmel. Warum steht das „Helden“ denn nur in Anführungsstrichen (hups…schon wieder)? Nun ja…bei den Mitgliedern des Suicide Squad handelt es sich um den übelsten Abschaum, den oberfiesen Bösewichten, den Alpträumen und Dauerinsassen von Arkham Asylum.  Doch nach den tragischen Ereignissen von BVS: Dawn of Justice braucht die Welt eine Einsatztruppe aus Metawesen (so nennt man die Superwesen bei DC) um sich den neuen Gefahren ohne Rücksicht auf Verluste (auch im eigenen Team) in den Weg zu stellen…Mist nur, das die Gefahr dann irgendwie aus den eigenen Reihen kommt. Aber wen wundert das noch, bei solch einer illustren Auswahl an Schurken? Das DC-Pendant zu MARVEL’s Thunderbolts vereinigt seit den 80zigern Strafgefangene mit außerordentlichen Fähigkeiten für riskante Geheimaufträge, denen im Austausch Straffreiheit zugesagt wird. Die „Task Force X“ erfreute sich mit einer Mischung aus Action und Spionagethriller schnell großer Beliebtheit. Seitdem wurde das Squad in vielen Comicserien veröffentlicht und hatte in sich immer wieder verändernder Besetzung Gastauftritte in Animated-Serien und der Erfolgsserie „Arrow“.  Im ersten Kino-Blockbuster der Antihelden setzt sich das Team ebenfalls aus einigen Namenhaften Charakteren zusammen. Unter anderem dem besten Auftragskiller der Welt - Deadshot (Will Smith), Harley Quinn (Margot Robbie) - die durchgeknallte geliebte vom Joker, sowie Killer Croc (Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje) – der Krokodilmutant aus der Kanalisation von Gotham City. Klingt nach jeder Menge Starpower? Richtig! Und das ist noch nicht alles. DC ließ sich nicht Lumpen und holte weiterhin Jared Leto als Joker, Ben Affleck als Batman, Jai Courtney als Captain Boomerang, Cara Delevingne als oberfiese Hexe Enchantress und, und, und….der Cast liest sich wie das Who is Who der aktuellen Schauspielerriege Hollywoods. Aber machen die Mimen ihre Arbeit auch gut? Definitiv JA! DC ist es gelungen den einzelnen Charakteren genug Zeit einzuräumen und die einzelnen Motive jedes einzelnen Anti-Helden zu beleuchten. Lediglich Killer Croc bleibt dabei etwas blass zurück.  Highlight ist natürlich wie zu erwarten Jared Leto als psychopatischer Gangsterclown Joker. Leto schafft es in verhältnismäßig wenig Spielzeit eine völlig neue und diabolische Seite von Batmans Erzfeind zu zeigen. Hier freue ich mich definitiv auf mehr. Vllt ja bereits im nächsten Batman-Solofilm unter der Regie von Affleck? Apropo Ben Affleck. Dieser verbindet als Batman wunderbar diesen Film mit vorherigen Ereignissen und endlich…ja ENDLICH hat man das Gefühl das auch DC endlich ein zusammenhängendes Universum in die Bahn bringt. Cameo eines recht schnellen Superhelden in Rot inklusive ;) Margot Robbie als Harley Quinn bleibt aber der heimliche Star des Films, auch wenn man krampfhaft versucht Will Smith in diese Rolle zu drängen. Robbie gelingt es durch eine unglaublich starke Mimik und ja…viel Haut…alle Augen auf sich zu ziehen. Bewusst spielt sie immer wieder mit den Klischees der klassischen Rollenverteilung und es macht unheimlich Spaß ihren Zwiegesprächen mit den eigenen Stimmen im Kopf zu lauschen. Eyecatcher ist für mich persönlich die bezaubernde Cara Delevingne. Ihre Performance als gruselige und mächtige Hexe Enchantress hat mich echt beeindruckt. Zuweilen zwar recht Creepy aber doch immer irgendwie bezaubernd. :D Die meisten Lacher konnte mir überraschenderweise Jay Courtney als Captain Boomerang entlocken. Vor diesem Film fand ich den Schauspieler so „naja“, konnte er mich doch weder als Sohn von Bruce Willis in „Stirb Langsam 5“ noch als John Conner in „Terminator: Genisys“ so richtig überzeugen. Als leicht asozialer Boomerang der eigentlich ständig nur damit beschäftigt ist irgendwie aus der Sache rauszukommen und sich die nächste Büchse Bier zu öffnen fand ich den jungen Mann dagegen höchst amüsant und spaßig. Letzteres drückt auch den Gesamteindruck des Filmes perfekt aus: Spaß. Im sonst doch recht biederen DCU schafft es der Film zum Glück nie den nötigen Witz aus den Augen zu verlieren und gerät im Gegensatz zu anderen Streifen dieser Zunft nicht allzu ernst. Klar. Der Plot des Films wird keinen Preis für seine tiefgründige Story gewinnen. Mal ehrlich…wie soll DER Trupp im Ernstfall Superman besiegen? Und wo waren all die echten Superhelden? Ein alter, mächtiger Gott wütet DREI Tage lang durch eine Weltstadt…und weder Batman noch Wonder Woman etc. interessieren sich dafür? Aber egal. Blendet man das alles aus, wird man knapp 2 Stunden WUNDERBAR unterhalten.  Kleiner Tipp: Schaut wirklich zuerst Batman vs Superman. Sonst könntet ihr gleich am Anfang einen massiven Spoiler serviert bekommen. Ich vergebe 3,5 von 5 Punkten und freue mich einfach wie verrückt über das Kinojahr 2016. Denn egal wer am Ende den Wettstreit um die Krone der Comicverfilmungen an sich reißt…gewonnen hat schon jemand. WIR. Comicfans, wir leben in rosigen Zeiten. :)',9);

INSERT INTO evaluate_review VALUES(251,6.0,'Lifetime''s very modern take, even though it''s still a period piece, on the mystery surrounding the murder of Lizzie Borden''s father and stepmother. I think a good portion of the audience who watched this film know at least something about this famous double murder. Well, maybe not. I''ve got a few teenage god kids and they don''t know any sort of history, important or not. As a child I was super curious about history and I watched a tone of documentaries on PBS and one day they were talking about Lizzie Borden, I''ve been kind of fascinated ever since. I took a stance that she was innocent, people did see a strange man around the neighborhood. I don''t believe a lot of the theories out there. I don''t think it was Bridgette, the maid, who do it. I''ve grown to believe that Lizzie probably did in fact kill her parents, whether it was for the money or how some have theorized, over sexual abuse, we will never truly know. Lifetime''s version of this famous double murder where Lizzie gets acquitted is almost like a music video. Let''s make this murder sequence a montage set to some trippy music. The film leaves no doubt in the viewers mind that they are portraying Lizzie as guilty, conniving, cold, mentally unstable, and utterly brilliant. The sets are very sparse, the costumes look okay, it kinda looks cheap but they did the best they could on a tv budget. I really hate when they try so hard to modernize a period piece. Everyone speaks and acts a little to modern for the era, no one feels like the actually belong in 1892. The audience is not stupid, they can follow along. The film also plays fast and lose with the facts but do remain accurate on some of the events, like certain things that happened at the trial. Many theories play out here, like Lizzie was completely naked when she committed the murders, that''s why no blood was found on her clothing. Major kudos to all the actors that were involved, they knew what type of telefilm they were doing and went full speed ahead. Christina Ricci was delightful as Lizzie. Lizzie Borden Took An Ax is a campy twist to an infamous double homicide committed over a hundred years ago. It doesn''t pretend to be anything else or take itself to seriously. It was a fun watch, I admit. Christina Ricci''s Lizzie is so duplicates you can''t help but cheer for her. It''s amazing how Lizzie got off, a great lawyer and a few fainting spells did her well. The truth is we''ll never actually know what really went on when the murders were committed. We can guess why and even debate on whether or not Lizzie did it alone, with an accomplice or not at all. This was a fascinating court case and there are plenty of books and documentaries on the subject. The Borden house still stands today, it''s a bed and breakfast. The original furniture is still in the house, you can still see and sit on the blood stained couch were Andrew Borden was murdered and lay dead. It sits in the exact same spot to memorialize he last moments. The room were Abby Borden was murdered in, found hacked to death on her bedroom floor, still sits exactly how it was that fateful day. You can see the alleged murder weapon in a museum. All that is fascinatingly creepy.',10);

INSERT INTO evaluate_review VALUES(276,6.0,'What a strange, strange adaptation. A very loose adaptation of the true story of Lizzie Borden, the young woman who killed her parents with an axe in the late 19th century, Lizzie Borden Took an Ax stars Ricci as Lizzie and focuses on the week that led to the murders and the travesty of a trial that ensued. Its stylistic, anachronistic style is what makes it a strange adaptation to me. I''m not at all adverse to this approach and some movies excel at being vague with where their story is placed in time (It Follows is a perfect example of this). However, here, it often feels oddly disconnected. Which perhaps is the goal; to have Lizzie feel slightly off reality, outside of this world. What I refer to by all of this is the overuse of contemporary rock music in scenes depicting Lizzie acting out her impulses, or walking to a trial and so on. You don''t expect The Black Keys to start blasting out during a scene set in 1892. Add to this some very Tarantinesque camera shots and the result is, as I''ve mentioned twice so far... strange. But it''s not repulsive. It certainly sets it apart from the other, numerous adaptations of Lizzie''s story. And in some ways, it helps cover the uneven acting skills of the other actors. I was surprised to see Stephen McHattie in this and I feel he was underused. He essentially made Pontypool the sleeper hit that it is. Ricci''s talent is as always under-appreciated here and it feels like Ricci herself knew this adaptation wasn''t all that serious as a quirky overacting permeates some of the scenes. Someone should have told the other actors who acted like this was a serious time piece. I liked it. I''d watch it again.',10);

INSERT INTO evaluate_review VALUES(286,4.0,'Back in 1987, DC Comics started publishing Suicide Squad by John Ostrander and Luke McDonnell. Ostrander''s brilliant premise was this: in a world of independent, potentially dangerous people and aliens with powers far beyond those of mortal men, the American government found itself in need of a covert task force of equally super-powered people to counter the perceived threat. Government agent Amanda Waller - one of the great creations of modern comics - recruits a team of so-called super-villains into Task Force X, offering them time off their prison sentences in exchange for engaging in suicide missions for the government. They really have little choice, because Waller has implanted bombs in their necks that can be set off remotely if the villains try to escape or otherwise disobey. Colloquially, they''re known as the Suicide Squad, since the odds of coming back from any given mission are slim. This paranoid, cynical premise is a perfect reflection of the late cold war era, and Ostrander played on the tropes of the time brilliantly, giving the villainous characters depth rivaling and even surpassing DC''s more famous protagonists - Batman, Wonder Woman, Superman and all the rest. During the course of the series one-note villains such as the ludicrous Captain Boomerang or the deeply damaged Deadshot are given new dimensions; as I reader, I found myself sympathizing with them even on those occasions when they were put into conflict with the mainstream heroes. Over the course of five years and 63 issues, Ostrander and his team delivered engaging, morally ambiguous stories rich with drama, action and character development, while also offering wry commentary on the politics of the day. When I heard that Suicide Squad was to be adapted to film, I was equal parts excited and wary. Summer blockbusters are not the ideal venue to explore the more subtle aspects of Ostrander''s original comic; it would be all to easy to simply skim off the surface of the work - the action and some character beats - throw them into a few chase and fight sequences and call it a day. And indeed, that''s exactly what''s happened with David Ayer''s big screen Suicide Squad. The film is front-loaded with exposition, it''s too dark - not in tone, but visually - and the villain is a one-note mystical force when what this film needed was a more grounded first mission. To a degree, I enjoyed the treatment of the Squad members: assassin Deadshot, petty crook Captain Boomerang, the deranged clown princess of crime, Harley Quinn, the monstrous, mutated Killer Croc, the witch-possessed Enchantress, the ex-gang banger El Diablo, and their government overseers, Colonel Rick Flag and Katana, who wields a sword that steals the souls of those it kills. Of course this reads as somewhat ridiculous, but part of enjoying this genre is accepting that the world of superheroics includes all manner of wondrous and bizarre properties. What makes the film work (to the limited extent that it does) is the way these characters interact with each other and how they respond to the situation Amanda Waller and the government have imposed upon them. They are, to say the least, reluctant heroes, and the antagonistic griping slung back and forth is one of the small delights of the film. The other is the way in which the backstories of several of the characters are revealed, particularly Deadshot, Harley Quinn and El Diablo. Each has his or her own dreams and fears, some realized, some not by the movie''s end. The mission itself is simple and linear: the squad has to fight its way through horde of monsters to first rescue an important figure trapped in the fray, and then to take out the threat itself. While not nearly as well done as similar sequences in Dredd or The Raid: Redemption, the combination of action and character interplay keeps the film moderately entertaining, and the final showdown itself is well-executed, has some emotional weight, and even lives up to the title in ways I won''t spoil. The film also benefits from a great soundtrack and a neon purple-green colour palette that should have been used for more than the opening exposition sequences and the opening and closing credits; they give the film a very distinctive look during the sections where it''s used, and could have livened up the (literally) darker sections of the movie. The cameos from other DC characters feel unforced and natural, organic to the story, another plus. Unfortunately, while Jared Leto gives his all as the Joker, his interpretation just doesn''t work. It''s possible that I''m being too easy on the film, given that it comes in the wake of the truly awful Batman v. Superman: Dawn of Justice. But for the first time after watching one of the modern DC movies, I actually want to see more of these characters and their world. Finally, the mid-credits sequence drops a very tantalizing possibility, one I hope a competent filmmaker realizes. Suicide Squad is by no means a great movie, but it has a goofy charm thanks primarily to the charisma and pain of its core characters. Given a little polish and extra time in the editing room, it may have almost lived up to the comic itself. It doesn''t reach that point - it doesn''t really come close - but Suicide Squad (the film), deserves credit for ambition, if nothing else, and for showing the humanity in monsters and the monsters in humanity.',9);

To write a defense about it is a hard task, since the movie is guilty of all the sins which are commonly acknowledged. It has a messy script, the most decipherable element with a judgement practiced and biased by tv shows, and it doesn''t pander to critics and audience with trending themes and pop-culture references. I’ve always thought that the script in the end is the most expendable element in a film, so I can easily pass on that, even if its defects drag along similar problems in direction and editing. But in the there are three elements that pretty much make amends for everything else, making Suicide Squad a pretty enjoyable flick with a high entertainment value. The first one is the anarchy of its mise en-scene. Unfortunately it is merely the lucky result of a troubled set and a confused direction, where the editing department was left with the most difficult part of the job. Nevertheless its asymmetrical construction and confused development match the silliness of its protagonists. The rhythm is incredibly fast, there are no weak moments until the very end. And for last, the cast. It is a perfect example of how a good casting can save a bad film. In this case, everything is carried on Will Smith and Margot Robbie’s shoulders. It is one of the few things Ayer got right (or -better- where the production didn’t interfere), deciding to focus the film on them. Smith is a renowned star, and has made a career out of saving shitty movies with just his presence; of course he was the perfect choice for Deadshot.

INSERT INTO evaluate_review VALUES(333,6.0,'Lizzie Borden Took An Ax (in Canada and Britain, she took an axe) is about Christina Ricci, who is accused of having murdered her father and step-mother with an ax in 1892. Unlike a lot of other movies that feature lengthy interrogations and court trials, it''s apparent that Lizzie did, in fact, take an ax. In fact, the movie flashes back repeatedly to Christina Ricci taking an ax and marching right on up to her step-mom and father, shaking off her clothes to keep them from getting bloody (too bad this was rated PG-13), and butchering her parents with an ax (violence is OK with PG-13). So instead of the usual "I wonder if she did it", we''re instead left to wonder whether or not the jury will believe she did it. Now-a-days, there wouldn''t be too much to wonder about. The prosecutor spelled out in simple language how obvious it is that Lizzie Borden was the only person capable of murdering her family (though there was that other random ax murder that took place while she''s in jail). But then again, Christina Ricci is so pretty, maybe she didn''t murder her family after all. Lizzie Borden Took An Ax is a Lifetime made-for-TV movie, but it features a pretty large collection of recognizable actors, and seems to have put a fair amount of money into the making of this movie. So while the story-telling does have that made-for-TV feel to it, the rest of it is fairly polished. I didn''t know the story of Lizzie Borden beforehand, and reading up on it afterward shows that the movie tried to re-create the story nearly exactly, though it did change some trivial things -- like the stain on her dress (paint, not stew) and the query for the druggist (acid to clean a cloak, not poison to kill rats).',10);

There''s no consistency, no real hook established, none of the characters are convincing or redeemable. It sucks. The twenty fucking minute long introduction to each and every character was one of the most incompetent filmmaking decisions I''ve seen from a Hollywood production. Twenty minutes.

It has a surprisingly good cast for a Lifetime TV movie, including Clea DuVall, Gregg Henry, and Stephen McHattie. Everyone plays their parts well, and there are basically zero parts of the movie where the performances are unconvincing. A lot of other reviewers have complained about the use of modern music in the movie, but I think it gives the film a nice edge and separates it from typical period piece banality. Music is used to great dramatic effect in the whole movie, and the film as a whole manages to maintain its pacing, even during a prolonged courtroom section that is usually the death of many murder mysteries in terms of keeping the story moving. I wasn''t 100% thrilled with the way it ended, as it seems to imply a little heavily that Borden was definitely guilty, despite so much evidence on the contrary.

I know enough to know who some of the other suspects are, and I know enough to know why some of them aren''t good suspects, but I''ve only read one book about the crime, and I don''t know how valid its conclusions are. (Never, ever take your conclusions about a crime from a single source.) I know that no one was ever convicted of the murders. I know only one person was ever put on trial for it, and she was acquitted. I also know that, in the public memory, she''s guilty. The rhyme we all somehow learn as children gets almost everything wrong. This is, in short, another historical cold case that I don''t think will ever be solved, though unlike with Jack the Ripper, I am inclined to believe that the person who did it is someone whose name we''ve heard. This was a family crime. It took place in broad daylight, and history records only one other similar crime in the area at the time. (The article isn''t available anymore, but it is apparently certain that the murderer in that case could not have been the murderer in this one.) All things considered, it is unlikely to have been committed by the random psychopath whom I believe to be the perpetrator in the Ripper case. It was almost certainly someone who knew the victims and hated them both. Lizzie Borden (Christina Ricci) was thirty-two in 1892. She still lived at home with her father, Andrew (Stephen McHattie), and her stepmother, Abby (Sara Botsford). So did her sister, Emma (Clea DuVall), who was forty-one. One very hot August day, while Emma was out of town staying with friends, Andrew and Abby were murdered. First, Abby was hit with an unknown weapon, probably a hatchet, while in the bedroom upstairs, then the killer hit her nineteen more times in the back of the head, probably while sitting on her back. Then, about an hour later, Andrew was killed in the living room, probably while taking a nap. He was struck some ten or eleven times himself. Lizzie sent Bridget (Hannah Anderson), the maid, to fetch a doctor, and the police were summoned as well. Emma returned home at about the same time. Lizzie became the prime suspect, mostly because she gave confused and contradictory answers. There is some vague talk of a stranger''s being seen on the Borden property that morning, but nothing comes of it. The Bordens'' bodies are exhumed (I''m not sure that''s actually the right term, given that they weren''t quite buried yet) at the funeral, and an autopsy was performed. And, in what seems an inevitable sequence of events, Lizzie is put on trial for the murders. As I said, I don''t know a lot, but I do know the film changes just enough to put the worst possible slant on some of the evidence. A burglary which took place a year before the murders is shown to be Lizzie stealing from her stepmother days before. Lizzie did buy prussic acid the day before the murders, but it wasn''t so she could kill rats in the attic. It was, she said, to clean a sealskin coat. It doesn''t seem likely to have been true, all things considered, but that''s what she told the druggist. Worst of all, there is the issue of that dress. The dress Lizzie burned was never shown to have been the one she wore the day of the murders. She did burn it the day after she found out she was a suspect, but it wasn''t the midnight bonfire the movie shows; it was in the middle of the day, and she burned it in the kitchen stove. The one who spotted her burning it wasn''t Emma; it was family friend Alice Russell (Andrea Runge). Certainly she hadn''t been ordered to bring it to court the next day; if that was what they wanted, why wouldn''t they have just sent a police officer to her house to take it? I don''t deny that the whole thing looked suspicious, but the idea that they''d burned it because it was old and unpleasant is ridiculous; Lizzie said it had gotten covered in paint and ruined, which is a bit different. There''s a lot that was never proven, and the movie doesn''t seem to care. It was never proven what the murder weapon was. There were several candidates in the basement--two hatchets, two axes, and a hatchet head with a broken handle--but while it was speculated that the last one was the weapon, the prosecution never proved it. They never even took any of the tools with them for study. Contrary to what the movie shows, Lizzie was never even checked for bloodstains. It was basically assumed that she was a woman, and women wouldn''t commit such crimes. And then, they changed their minds. Why? There are several possibilities. It couldn''t have been Emma; her alibi is solid. It wasn''t possible given 1892 technology for her to have made the necessary trips. Bridget? Possible, but I don''t think it''s probable. No one else was known to have been in the house. That makes Lizzie a probable suspect all by itself. She did give contradictory answers, even some proven to be wrong. Strangely, one of the things considered most damning was her insistence that Abby was her stepmother, not her mother. However, I have friends who get along with their stepmothers who would still be scrupulous about the clarification, and while Lizzie didn''t get along with hers, that isn''t proof of murder. There is probably a great movie to be made from the story of Lizzie Borden (and, yes, her birth name was Lizzie), but this isn''t it. Clea DuVall is actually older than Christina Ricci, which I hadn''t realized she was--but only three years older. Emma was nine years older than Lizzie. Clea DuVall looks younger than Christina Ricci, too. I wasn''t best thrilled with the deliberately anachronistic music. It kind of creeped me out how much they were sexualizing Lizzie and her actions; I mean, take a look at that poster. Okay, so "in her underwear" and "naked" are probably the most likely ways for Lizzie to avoid getting blood on a dress, assuming she did it, but we are deliberately supposed to think of Lizzie''s suppressed sexuality; it''s implied that her father doesn''t want her to marry. And even if that''s true, that doesn''t mean you should sexualize ax (or even hatchet) murder. The movie does silly and unnecessary flashbacks. I liked the costuming quite a lot, but if that''s the best part of the movie, that''s not good. (Oh, and Lizzie''s lawyer is Billy Campbell, formerly the Rocketeer. So there''s that.) I disagree with the reviews I''ve read that this was just another Lifetime Original Movie in most senses of the word, but it wasn''t terribly good, either. You may believe she was guilty, and you may believe she was innocent, but either way, I''m pretty sure she deserves a better telling of her story than this.',10);

INSERT INTO evaluate_review VALUES(366,2.0,'Pulled from Twitter: Revisiting it again HANDS DOWN the worst DCEU film. Aside from some decent performances, this film leaves an ugly after-taste. But for archival purposes here is my OG review: #SuicideSquad is not as abysmal as the reviews suggest. BUT... it ain''t good. Definitely a big disappointment. The 1st act when we''re introduced to all the characters I thought was going fine. I surprisingly liked Will Smith as Deadshot. In fact the cast all around (except ONE guy in which we''ll get to) is pretty spot on in their roles. @MargotRobbie oozes charisma. One last positive I''ll say is that despite the VERY bad editing, the movie didn''t indulge itself in a 2 & 1/2 hour runtime like BvS did. Now.... let''s talk about the bullshit. Firstly, Jared Leto SUCKED as the Joker. Easily the worst interpretation I''ve seen to date. So the much hyped BTS drama the actor stirred led to a performance that''s on par with Eddie Redmayne from Jupiter Ascending. I''ll go more into the Joker himself later but needless to say this is an insult to Mark Hamill, Heath Ledger, Jack Nicholson, & Cesar Romero The REAL villains of the film are some of the worst I''ve seen to date. And that''s saying A LOT b/c we just had Lex & Doomsday from BvS. Amanda Waller wants to combat Metahumans with other Metahumans. But aside from Diablo, NONE of them have actual superpowers. -____- The threat that was faced in this movie didn''t lend towards the needs of non-powered villains. Batman & Wonder Woman could do it for you. There''s a REALLY good animated DC film called #BatmanAssaultOnArkham which is what the live-action Suicide Squad film should have been. I mention this movie b/c it highlights the BIGGEST problem with David Ayer''s film. The development of the Squad characters themselves In Assault on Arkham they are villains through & through. It''s only b/c of Amanda Waller the Squad BARELY get along & do a good deed. In Ayer''s film, they are made to be more sympathetic & even have a comradery which defeats the whole purpose of this concept of VILLAINS.',9);

I''m glad they also showed her getting the morphine injections (and then having to be questioned by police) as I remember being surprised and appalled when I read that somewhere ages ago. I was not a fan, however, of the interjection of modern music all over the place--especially when they showed Lizzie Borden sneaking off to attend the party she was forbidden to go to.

Zu den Figuren kann man wenig sagen da lediglich Will Smith'' Figur Deadshot und die verrückte Harley Quinn ein wenig Backstory erhalten und alle andern im Schnelldurchlauf vorgestellt werden wodurch sie nahezu keinerlei Tiefe erhalten. Die Action im Film ist soweit ok, findet aber überwiegend nachts statt so daß man oftmals wenig davon sieht. Viel Interesse richtet sich auch auf Jard Letos Neuinterpretation des Jokers, der diese Rolle in der Tat neu erfindet, aber leider noch nicht zum Guten. Der Film zeigt ihn einfach nur als eine Art Obergangster mit schrägem Outfit der obendrein schlecht synchronisiert ist. Und zum Schluß ist der Soundtrack absoluter Fluch und Segen des Films: hier wird wirklich eine lange, geile Playlist wie auf einem Musiksender durchgespielt, aber leider überlagert oft die Musik die Handlung und wird dadurch zu aufdringlich.

If you must, watch the trailer and learn nothing else about it. It''s about equal parts outrageous as it is conventional, which I think helps keep itself from eschewing into art house territory (and depending on your opinion, this is either for better or for worse). I really, really hate buzzwords, but I also really, really don''t want to give much away. That said, it''s hard to put it into one solid genre (genre-defying!). It''s heartfelt, it''s thrilling, but I think what most viewers seem to resonate with is the humanity of the film that defines its through-line. That humanity helps ground the more outrageous parts, and the simple, high-concept plot is helps the film maintain momentum while still keeping the main character''s relatability. It''s well written. That''s what I''m trying to say. I wouldn''t call the filmmaking necessarily "exceptional." Aside from the (fantastic) performances, no single aspect of the cinematography, blocking, editing, or sound design really stood out (okay, there was one scene where the shot went out of focus during a single, but it fit the emotion of the scene kinda so lets ignore, cool thank you). I suppose this isn''t a bad thing. The film was really only trying to tell its story through the performances of the cast, so I wouldn''t consider it a bad thing. You could almost call it sublime. Almost. While writing this review I kept leaning back and forth between 3 stars (out of 4, fuck you letterboxd for not allowing custom scales) and a full four stars. Does this film really deserve 4 stars? I think it warrants a second viewing to decide. 3 out of 4 stars. Border is a great film, best experienced knowing next to nothing about it.

Really though, considering the vast library of great films from decades past, the only thing that really interests me about modern filmmaking is innovation. That''s obviously a broad term though and is meant as such, so that anything from technical innovation to subject matter is included. This film doesn''t have much innovation in the former, but all the more in the latter. It''s really a delightfully strange film, its surreal central metaphor/allegory resisting (at least for most of the film) any easy mapping onto the real world political landscape, apart from some very vague idea of "the other", and is all the better for it. The concept is so hard to explain, making very little sense, but that''s really the core of the enjoyment for a good while. And once that novelty wears off a bit, the film gets very explicit and sensually provocative in ways that are even more delightful than what has come before. Keeping us occupied while all of that slowly develops is a b-plot that, while not superlative in any way, definitely serves as good filler and interesting character work. If I had to find faults with the film, it would have to be that its central premise does start to get more tangible and closer to real world analogues towards the end. This dampens the surrealism a bit and also presumably makes the film a bit more vulnerable to accusations of taking ownership of certain material that it perhaps can''t entirely handle. There''s also a coldness to the film, related to its commitment to its premise, making this more of an intellectual exercise than an empathetic one. That would be perfectly fine if it wasn''t for the fact that this intellectual part is a bit weakened by the previously mentioned motions towards a more decipherable allegory. Still, these are very tiny flaws to one of the best and most original films of the year for me so far.',11);

She wears lots of make up for this role but the make up design and her tremendous acting ability are in perfect sync and she gets a lot of emotion out of her eyes and reactions over the make up. She wants to fit in with the human world buying groceries and living in a house with a human but still gets the side eye and called names but finally meets someone like her that makes her feel seen for who she is truly and even encourages her to embrace totally her troll side and turn on the humans. It''s a really great meditation about identity and sense of purpose in the world. It''s an impeccably directed and well written fairy tale like Let the Right One In and Let Me In were but I was taken with this even more and felt similar to The Shape of Water but getting the perspective from "the other".

The screenplay is also really well plotted with twists and connection that make earlier scenes make much more sense if you are truly engaged and following along so I encourage you to seek this one out in a theater where you aren''t distracted.

And if my only objection was being grossed out by the two doughy actors cavorting through the woods like a couple of slope-browed, naked hobbits then you’d be right to mock me for being shallow. But the burgeoning romance between outsiders runs parallel to an astonishingly ill-advised and legally dubious* police procedural b-story that centers around literal infant rape that ultimately dovetails with our two lovers in a way that made me want to take a shower.

From there, it decided to be [at least] three different movies. In the proces, it completely dropsthe more interesting subtexts it originally established in favor of some pretty  distasteful elements. Once this happened, I found myself bored. While I wouldn’t say I was ever annoyed enough to walk out of the theater, I did space out,l. When I tuned back in, I think, “Oh god I missed so much!” before spacing out again five minutes later. The midpoint is genuinely weird – but maybe only weird for the sake of being weird – and kept me on the edge of my seat, although not in a good way. I did hope after that that things would start to click, but soon enough I was bored again.  The lead here is stellar, but most of the other performances were subpar, or the character was too obtuse for me to ever get them. While there was never anything wrong on a technical level, it also wasn’t ever interesting. This is a subpar movie that I wish I hadn’t paid to see. If I had streamed it, I would’ve been happier.

The film should make me care (and most do).   The film really alienated me before it got where it was going emotionally. I was intrigued by a sense of mystery, but then the answer to that mystery (slight spoiler) was something that was basically a sort of deus ex machina. It was so grounded in reality, then decided to be entirely fantasy. I found it really alienating after learning to be with these characters in a realistic setting.  As for its message, it just wasn’t anything we haven’t seen a million times before. Honestly. And I was so pulled out of the film by it subverting expectations so suddenly that I didn’t feel like it earned the grand reckoning that we are meant to feel for the character. It also felt like the second half, where all of this happened, was much more rushed than the first half. It made it really hard to feel for the character when I was still trying to feel for myself.  But I loved the prosthetics and visual effects. It looked really great. And to be both clear and fair, I can see the draw of this film.

It''s suitably unsettling at times and Eva Melander''s transformative lead performance is certainly effective but man, this one isn''t for me.',11);

INSERT INTO evaluate_review VALUES(640,9.0,'The French term "jolie laide" translates roughly to "beautifully ugly;" visceral beauty that is enhanced rather than undermined by imperfection. The term is applicable not only to the characters here, but the film itself. The success of Gräns rests heavy on the viewer; how far you are willing to suspend disbelief and be swept away by fairytale and folklore, challenge your own preconceptions and bias as well knowledge of history and worldview. While I am familiar with but not exceptionally knowledgable about the issues surrounding immigration in Sweden and Scandinavia, the allegory can be transposed onto most European countries as well as the USA. The borders in the film are geographic, political, sexual, racial, etc. as well as the genres encapsulated in the film itself; fairytale, allegory, horror, black comedy, procedural thriller. It succeeds on all but the latter - the procedural involving a pedophilia ring is a devise to move things along but not all that critical. What the film does best is upend Norse folklore by planting it firmly a grim and contemporary context that is tense and ugly but also full of wonder.',11);

The other option - if you''re an assimilative queer, the other option is to reject the morality and belief system that barely accommodates you, to protect your own, to exact retribution where necessary, commune with the natural when possible, let your life go to seed, and imagine what''s possible across the water. The interrogation of bourgeois morality uses the most repulsive possible terms: how better to get your attention?

I don''t regret going in knowing very little, and Melander in particular tries her damndest to create a sympathetic character, but ... man, I just could not connect with these Shreks. (Is that a slur? Whatever, liberals!!). We''re told that these characters have experienced endless bigotry and cruelty, but what we''re actually shown isn''t much more than vague discomfort (that strip-search scene in particularly could''ve gone very dark, but instead it was sort of awkwardly polite?). And the eventual worldbuilding is pretty muddled, so if there''s supposed to be an allegory there for the hardships immigration / gender ambiguity / general other-ness then I didn''t see it. It just never quite finds a happy middle ground between grotesque and sincere -- I guess that final gesture was meant to be endearing, but I found it creepy, especially given the very unresolved subplot with the neighbor friends.
