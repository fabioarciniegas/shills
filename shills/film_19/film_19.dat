Amy Schumer is quite an actress in Trainwreak but less of a scriptwriter. Her stand-up shows are such a raw and funny experience that they set a standard to anything she does. While a pleasant experience to pass the time, the trouble with Trainwreak is that is presents itself as a genre film (coming of age comedy), thus establishing the audience’s expectations, but at many times it delivers the shape of a drama, in the Hollywood sense of the term.
Its fine.   Also Bill Hader is a national treasure.
The movie sorta ends on a flat note. Some scenes are worthy, but as a whole, Trainwreck doesn't really do it for me.
Really fucking funny.
two stars for brie larson. only
I know by now to not be fooled by the marketing for a Judd Apatow film. What seems like a comedy on the surface is rarely actually a comedy. 'Trainwreck' is funny at times, but definitely not the comedy presented by the trailers. That doesn't mean it's bad... but to be honest I'm having a hard time saying much positive about the film: it's way too long, writer and star Amy Schumer seems in over her head in the lead role, Bill Hader is utilized as more of a straight man than he should be. Those things being said, I think LeBron James has a career in acting when he wants to retire. Hilarious and pretty good timing. There's a lot more going on beneath the surface, but sometimes that's not a good thing. Its goal, first and foremost, was to succeed as a comedy and it didn't do a very good job in that. That nullifies anything else. I'm sure if you're a hardcore Amy Schumer fan perhaps there was a lot to enjoy. As I am not one, I was a bit out of place. I will give this a 3/5, although I feel like I'm being a little generous.
I can say that Judd Apatow is one of my most favorite comedy directors now.
why the fuck is this movie so long
As a known rom-com and Amy Schumer hater I went into this film expecting to be bored, annoyed and dismayed in equal measures. Instead I somewhat enjoyed myself. For all its crass humour this film has a sincere heart to it. I'm glad too Schumer isn't afraid to be un-pretty (though the unflattering outfits tended more towards distracting). There was a spark of the real in how the film shows relationships as flawed, imperfect things but worth it anyways. Still way too long though, especially when you're waiting for the inevitable break up and reuniting.
Commentary
Watched this for Bill Hader, stayed for Lebron James. It was alright. The rift in their relationship seems really trivial. I mean, a lot of people now have commitment issues so I think that  people are more open to discussing that. But really, idk what and why those happened in the third act.
Trainwreck is a train wreck of a movie. It's sad that celebrities making cameos are the only good thing one can say about the movie.
One star because I didnt know Tilda Swinton was in it until the end and that was a nice surprise.
a bill hader thirst watch
I think that Amy Schumer was right to challenge typical romantic comedy tropes but in the end just failed to succeed. We need more than just switching gender roles. If you’re not making the romantic interest a round character then you aren’t really challenging anything. Raising the female to the typical male role just makes the romantic interest a manic pixie dream boy rather than girl. Other than that I’d say both of their profomances were good, but it just feels like the same formula that can be seen from movies from 20 years ago.
can y’all believe anyone ever thought amy schumer was funny bc i cannot
these two stars are for bill hader and bill hader only!
Two things: 1. Lebron James can actually act and is hilarious. 2. John Cena can actually act, and balances a shower towel on his erect penis.
the scene from basterds where eli roth bashes in that nazi's head with a baseball bat but instead it's amy schumer bashing in woody allen's head
Okay catch the motherfucking tea: this was cute
It wants for some parts to be a hyperreal screwball comedy where battles of wit are replaced with improv'ed sex jokes and exasperated rants. That can and is funny in the film but when it plays a scene out underneath that zenith of wackiness it's flat because characters and sincerity aren't allowed to breathe as much as the no holds barred unrealistic cornerstones. Amy Schumer's script works best when it's specific rather than broad, based clearly in actual experiences instead of anyone-can-make-'em fuck jokes, exemplified significantly more in the much sweeter second half.
Best part about this movie is Lebron James!
Better than I thought it would be. Bill Hader is so likable.
Where’s the 90 minute cut with all of the unnecessary, unfunny, and straight up time wasting moments removed? Because that’d actually be a pretty damn good movie. I mean seriously—I can’t remember a comedy that ran so gut-bustingly hot in the first half only to flip a switch and become so excruciatingly cold in the second. Schumer’s solid here though, and unsurprisingly, LeBron is MVP. Again.
rewatched just for him (bill hader)
It took me 4 days to finish this but amazing cat Amy knew she had to makeup for her inability lol
It's funny, witty and it's smart (unlike a majority of latest American comedies), although it's a bit lengthy. Younger audience will get it's up-to-date humour. It's thoroughly enjoyable and John Scena's skit is particularly amusing.
Amy Schumer writes and Judd Apatow directs, a brilliant team-up. I love this movie, it's funny and sincere with a lot of heart with Bill Hader as an unlikely leading man. The movie even ends in a great tearjerker! Schumer isn't afraid to write emotional scenes for herself and this movie shows her wide range of acting and is way better than her pointless tv show. The scenes with John Cena cracked me up. I had a good laugh, very good!!
I guess this was supposed to be edgy and funny? but it was just boring
ACTUALLY FUCK IT
“No offense, but I just think that sports are stupid and anyone who likes them is just a lesser person. And has a small intellect.”
Fuck Amy Schumer for making this very good and relate able movie that makes me cry.
the things I do for Bill Hader.
Certainly lives up to it's name, I guess.
this was actually good??? what??? brie larson is still killing the game.
watched and  stayed for bill hader
not great... i couldn't finish it! so many great people, Bill Hader, Mike Birbiglia, Brie Larson, and I was not entertaining!
I will be the first to admit I hate Amy Schumer but her & Judd Apatow did something special with this one.
I've read Amy's book and found it a little vulgar so I wasn't overly surprised to see this movie was as well. I wanted to like this movie but found the characters just weren't that believable. Normally the lead in a movie has some redeeming and lovable characteristic about them and I couldn't find one with Amy. It did have a happy ending, in more ways than one but that still wasn't enough to win me over.
Expected more from AS but this turned out to be a fairly standard romcom. She changed who she was so the guy would love her.
Yes Amy, this was a train wreck. Also, Bill deserves better
It me
(Old impressions, not based on a recent viewing) A solid story with a decent amount of laughs, but the atrocious ending flattened the whole thing as it thoroughly betrayed the spirit of the lead.
amy schumer proves that she is in fact even more horrible than i originally thought.
skipping to bill hader scenes to avoid amy schumer is bvgc culture
(Brie Larson Marathon) Amy Schumer couldn't make me laugh if her life depended on it. Lebron was funny though, John Cena, and Tilda Swinton who is completely unrecognizable and I totally lost it when I realized who she was. So I had a few laughs here and there but overall this kind of humor is not my cup of tea, it's too long and it's flaws are getting more and more obvious, until it completely falls apart in the third act. It's interesting, however, that I did find the dramatic aspects of the movie quite effective. Schumer is actually good when she's not desperate to get a laugh. I liked the scenes with her dad but the best are those involving her sister. Which brings me to Brie Larson who never fails to amaze me. Once again, she steals every single one of her scenes and she is making it all seem effortless. Now, I'm aware that running a Brie Larson marathon means I'm paying extra attention to her performance. But I honestly believe she stands head and shoulders above everyone in this and her natural stripped down approach is so contrasted with the other characters that it's impossible to miss. And I do remember having the exact same thought the first time I watched this. In fact I did a quick check on my notes and here is what I wrote: "She is by far the most mature character in the movie. Next to her they all look like caricatures. Quiet, simple, authentic. Great acting." Now that I watch her movies back to back I realize this is always the case. Being able to act without actually look like you are acting is a very special quality and Brie Larson is a natural. This marathon also helped me realize another thing I probably wouldn't otherwise notice. She plays a teenager, then a high school senior, then a college student, all in just a two year span. And in this one she's a mature married woman, has already raised a child and expecting another one. She goes from a schoolgirl to a wife and a mom in just three years, and you never even raise an eyebrow. Man, I'm telling you, this lady is special.
A train wreck from beginning to end.
A bit too long and conventional, but the entire cast is on their A-game throughout. 8/10
"I let Tim and his brothers tag-team me on Christmas morning. And you know what? It was wonderful."
I think the film title says it best. Also why LBJ, why.
Bill Hader and Brie Larson are too good for this movie. What did they do to their agents?
Liked this better the second time (which was this time). Schumer's character is such a tramp, trampy to the extent that it's off-putting, (I was put off by it, more the first time, less so this time as I was prepared at least). The trampiness is what she has to try to rise above to get something that she ultimately wants, and that's the trick in this fairly typically plotted rom com. So, with a typical plot, and somewhat unsympathetic protagonist, Trainwreck's gotta have some other things going for it. Well, there are a number of fun characters, and to look at three of the most important, Amy's own character 'Amy', when she's not blindly self indulgent, is funny, self aware, and self deprecating. Her boss, a demanding lunatic, is one of Tilda Swinton's most dementedly hilarious performances ever, while Bill Hader plays the likeable, rational, calm, cool, and collected love interest who keeps it all grounded. The film covers the ground along the line, the one that divides taste from lack of it, jumping back and forth across it as Amy pushes boundaries, consciously going too far before reeling it back in. She's looking to have the imperfect everywoman relate to her… but I'd say the average girl doesn't push things so far, and thus the film has not been embraced as much as it would have liked.
Trainwreck wasn't a complete crash, but did derail from its comedic tracks. Look, I like comedies. Laughing, smiling or even rolling on the floor in stitches. It's a beautifully contagious emotion, allowing you to forget about your woes. So, once again, another modern comedy failed to hit the mark. I'm getting sick and tired of subjecting myself to critically praised comedies, only for the end result to be "meh". Just give me something legitimately funny! A magazine writer, who enjoys sleeping around without consequence, starts interviewing a doctor who quickly falls in love with her. Predictably, we witness her come to terms with the dreaded word that revolves around relationships. "Commitment". Say it with me now. "Com-mit-ment". Now, there were a few aspects I appreciated. The chemistry between Schumer and Hader felt natural, exhuming a sense of realism. The minimal use of typical Hollywood romantic clichés (aside from the face-palming ending) felt refreshing and certainly made the story and its characters relatable. Surprisingly, John Cena and LeBron James provided the most humour. But when the sporting superstars are far funnier than the usual SNL actors, you know something went wrong. Honestly, Schumer isn't funny. She isn't! Objectively and subjectively. Hardly a "tour-de-force" performance, however some of the emotionally charged scenes were conveyed adequately. The character she portrays is mostly uninteresting, and unfortunately is the primary focus of the story. It's Hader's character that garners the most interest, but is rarely explored with a lack of backstory. Larson and Swinton were underused. And, I've saved the best criticism til last, they spoilt the ending to 'The Usual Suspects'. Really? You honestly thought ruining the ending to a classic, to which many still probably haven't seen it, would generate laughs? Uncalled for. So besides that sickening crime against humanity, the lack of humour, boring characters and horrific ending...it's alright. It's fine. Watchable atleast. But darn it, I'm done with modern comedies. They just further illustrate how cold I am.
this film is living up to it’s name
Lebron James: supporting comedy king
The least Apatow-ish Apatow movie? Lebron might lowkey be the best athlete performance in a comedy ever (at least up there with Kareem in Airplane!)
s/o to the Emmys for reminding me that I want to marry Bill Hader hey Hollywood: put LeBron in more things! or at least actually make The Dogwalker with Daniel Radcliffe and Marisa Tomei!
two and a half stars purely for bill hader, the one star for the rest of the film. i expected this to be bad because i dislike amy schumer and just thought i’d find it unwatchable because of that but bill was amazing and looked very very good. lebron was so funny as well and brie’s parts were good. love that
Two stars for my mans and that’s IT
yeah hi hello i watched this three times just to see bill hader and brie larson
Trainwreck is going to be very much a Marmite film. I think a lot of people won’t be able to enjoy the unlikability of the lead character (played by Amy Schumer) or the uncomfortableness of much of the script. But I not only loved it, I sympathised with much of it too (especially in the scenes where she is pressured into family situations, being the devoted aunt, etc – no idea why I identify with any of that). It’s blunt and unsubtle yet clever and consistently funny. In fact, it might well be the funniest film I’ve seen since Alan Partridge: Alpha Papa. But I’d only really recommend it to singletons without children. One final thing: there is an unbelievably good cameo performance in this too, one that’s jaw-dropping when you work out who It is, or when – like me – you have to look it up afterwards.
A waste of time
How about I just say I did not find the movie entertaining
Title about sums it up.
This is definitely one of my favourite films. The comedy and the drama are both really well done, and Amy Schumer and Bill Hader are really good lead actors. There’s loads of funny moments, like the scene at the cinema, and the scene where Amy and Aaron first meet. On the drama side of things, the way they handled Amy’s dad’s death was really well done as well. This is also probably one of the most well shot comedy films I’ve seen. I’m a big fan of Judd Apatow films, and this is definitely my favourite one.
I watched this just to watch Lebron. He was robbed for MVP last year. PLAYOFFS MATTER FOR MVP VOTING. ITS NOT JUST A REGULAR SEASON AWARD. HE AVERAGED OVER 30 IN THE PLAYOFFS. HARDEN AVERAGED LIKE 8 TURNOVERS A GAME. THE NBA IS CORRUPT.
I love this movie! Amy and Bill are hilarious and charming!
Tried twice to watch this, but Amy Schumer's character was just unbearably annoying. She a bad actress - overacting her part, coming off very tryhard. I also found the gay jokes with the wrestler tiring after a while. I was surprised I didn't like this since I love Apatow's other stuff. Usually her portrays good people doing funny things, but for some reason, he chose to depict bad people, and it just wasn't endearing or interesting to me. I'm determined to finish it though since I hear she redeems herself or w/e at the end...
m.youtube.com/watch?v=wk8xBAU4RYM
Hilarious. Surprisingly attracted to Bill Hader as a male love interest...
Not particularly funny.
yep too relatable 👌
I didn't wanna watch this tonight but it was on my vudu and I hit play anyway and it was funny and I couldn't stop watching it, so. I really like Amy Schumer she's funny.
bill sweetie im gonna get you outta there  also ezra god you deserve so much better
No the John cena scene didn’t make me uncomfortable 🤥
what a solid film dude i loved bill hader's sarcastic humor honestly what a fave i just fell more in love with him in this film also holy shit what a stacked cast??? like every new scene i'm like dudeee thats a famous person but i can't remember their name but i know they're famous
This is not a total trainwreck. I kind of enjoyed it. Trainwreck is at its best when it sticks to its narrative of a troubled woman, who despite her efforts, falls in love and starts an exclusive relationship. The movie is further strengthened by the chemistry between its stars. It manages to avoid or change some of the troops associated with the genre but is unable for some of them. I personally found the humor cringy at times. Ultimately, I think its worth a watch.
I'm not a fan of Amy Schumer, I find her loud and obnoxious and just 'unfunny.'
Acting: 3/5 Cinematography: 2/5 Editing: .5/5 Comedy: 2/5 ____________________________ Biggest problem is the lack of focus and terrible pacing (not helped by the horrible editing. Best thing is Bill Hader's performance.
Another in a long line of movies that worked more for me the first time. I still like it, but I didn't remember it being nearly this raunchy or long. The Cena stuff still killed me though.
Had more fun with the first half than I was expecting, but the Apatow formula has definitely wore thin. The 2+ hour runtimes of endless isolated single shot riffs has been tired for awhile, but his forced descent into mean, Real Drama really seems trying and almost spiteful to his audiences. The second half is so hateful and prolonged that you really feel that Apatow would rather you suffer the pain of a life of regrets than enjoy the triumph of two people, with all their messy human baggage finding a way to still somehow make life worthwhile. He's hated his audiences since FUNNY PEOPLE, it's time to hate him back.
I literally like everyone in this movie EXCEPT Amy Schumer. I like the joke about how cheap Lebron James is.
title checks out
A meandering dramedy, with so many unconnected scenes that it has no business being this long. There are many obvious, boring single-character shots to allow for maximum riffing. The leads are pretty good, but you have to suspend disbelief a bit when this tries to be serious. This is a surprisingly raunchy movie considering the story it's trying to tell, and almost none of those jokes landed for me. There are some offensive jokes this shouldn't be telling, which it tries to get away with by having them told by offensive or clueless characters annnnnd nope. LeBron and Cena are very funny though, in the grand tradition of giving the best jokes in female-centered comedies to men. Schumer also has some excellent deadpan line readings. This has its moments as both a drama and a comedy but you have to sift through a lot of meh to find them.
Sporadically, some really good stuff, but that age old critique of Apatow (in need of a good edit) is more applicable to Trainwreck than any of his other work. There’s a great 90 minute movie in here somewhere. The scene with Marv Albert, Chris Evert & Matthew Broderick is crime against film.
Where is Lebron’s Oscar
Goddammit, this is the second movie I watched in a row that lost its steam at the halfway point. The conflict was contrived; its source came from out of the blue because there hadn't been any evidence of the instigator exhibiting that kind of behaviour up until that moment. The ending and Amy's arc neither meshed with the movie's tone nor felt organic. Aaron and LeBron's scenes together elicited the most laughs from me.
Lebron and Bill Hader are good.
the only decent thing about this film is lebron james
The only time I really laughed was when LeBron quoted “Gold Digger”.
Lebron was the best actor
functioning, logical brain: amy schumer has said a lot of problematic things in the past and i shouldn't support her by watching this movie dumbass human brain: hhnngh bill hader Hot
I could now confirm that I am not an Amy Schumer fan, and that I do not want to see John Cena's butt ever again. It hits close to home despite the cringe seizures I went through, but this is Not My Kind of Funny. Oh hey, there's a working title for that next Amy Schumer project. Two stars, but I'm adding that special half-star for Bill Hader, because what a dreamboat. Let me add him to my list of RomCom Prince Charmings, right next to Paul Rudd in Clueless.
Brie Larson and Bill Hader did nothing to deserve this. Unsurprisingly, they are the best part. That funeral scene was pretty good, too.
Tilda Swinton and Brie Larson are too good for this.  Amy Schumer isn’t funny.
WTF, why are people hating on this film so much? its a perfectly fine film. Brie Larson is really good here.
So close to giving this four stars, but I do find it a touch overlong. I've watched it twice, and still laughed out loud on numerous occasions on the second viewing. Much better than the recent I Feel Pretty, hopefully Schumer returns to this form again soon.
I didn't end up hating this as much as I expected and I thought the ending was really cute, but overall, didn't super love it either. That said, LeBron James was HILARIOUS and I need Bill Hader as a romantic lead in movies far more often. Also, that fake movie with Marisa Tomei and Daniel Radcliffe needs to be real like now.
Not the greatest of Apatow's movies, but Trainwreck had its moments. Best parts were the scenes with Bill Hader and Lebron James.
The moment I started to see the movie I understood WHY I'm so late in seeing it.
The biggest sin this movie committed was giving Tilda Swinton a bad tan.  Not the most memorable rom-com out there but I had a good enough time watching it. I loved the entire cast and they were a lot of fun to watch. Tilda Swinton has such dynamic range, she nails the comedy in this! There's a drunk attempted sex scene with Ezra Miller and I found it hilarious. Lastly, Lebron James wasn't that bad in this.
Would have rather had a buddy comedy based around Lebron and Bill Haders characters
john cena's minecraft ass
I kinda hate myself a little that I don't hate this.
1) i'm glad i waited to watch this until i was super into bill hader otherwise i would have turned this film off as soon as i saw john cena's bare fucking ass 2) this film would be miles better if it let itself be earnest!! it would have such a sweet scene and then suddenly do a 180 and then i was watching ezra miller call amy schumer daddy and snort cocaine off her forehead 3) tilda swinton was so bad in this i'm convinced she's actually never been good 4) i'll be thinking about that sex scene with bill hader for a while the end
every time I watch this movie I’m even more convinced that dr aaron conners is the love of my life
It could have been better!
The things I do for Bill Hader
Better than I thought it was going to be. 7/10!
Would be better if Bill Hader had played his character from Hot Rod instead
Huge Judd Apatow fan. Not his best work. Okay at most, I think I just dont like Amy Schumer.
i only rewatched the first five minutes of this movie bc i didn’t remember what was brie doing here someone get her out!!!!!
it's all about commitment, right?
It's mildly entertaining if not completely hammer smashing on the nose. It's an easy watch on a sunday morning when thinking isn't the prime objective.
Sentence I never thought I'd write: Lebron James was fucking funny.
aaron conners really is my dream man i'm in love
This could have been like 50 minutes shorter, and also not dogshit.
i'm exactly six minutes into this film and i'm sure this is the rating it deserves
There are so many great things about this movie. Lebron, against all odds, is probably the best part about it. There are very few scenes I’ve ever laughed during as much as the restaurant scene and the basketball scene (where he talks to Amy). John Cena is also surprisingly great as well. Bill Hader is perfect as the lead, Brie Larson, despite a jarringly quick transformation from the hot high school chick (2012’s 21 Jump Street and 2013’s The Spectacular Now) to a late 20’s mom-to-be, is still great. And at the center of all of this, there’s the always untalented Amy Schumer, fucking up what could’ve been a future classic.
There was A LOT I didn't like about this movie. It's not even that funny and some of these unbearable scenes go on for way too long. Amy Schumer is super annoying in this which shouldn't come as a surprise. There are times too where we are given the laziest reasons for the plot to continue/change... And the end was cringe.
brie larson is an angel on this earth if there ever was one
Watched this for probably the 6th time today. A near perfect rom com with a little bit of a pacing issue. Bill Hader’s character is my dream man. LeBron needs to be in more movies. Brie Larson is an ANGEL.
This one arrived a few years ago already beset by the baggage of indifference: how could this be anything other than a Hudson/Day picture with the genders reversed and the dirty talk emancipated from the subtext? Now that I've finally gotten around to it, I can confirm that Trainwreck is exactly that, never rising above it and sometimes falling well below. But it is also - maybe just as predictably - sometimes very funny with flashes of disarming poignancy. First, the bad: in classic Apatovian fashion, it's about 20-30 minutes too long; as usual you get the sense that the comedy auteur sees himself as some kind of raunchy James L. Brooks, indulging dramatic detours and logorrhea in the interest of narrative depth. The problem is Apatow's faith in formulas, an affliction Schumer (who wrote the screenplay) shares. Even when it works to engage our sense of shared humanity, the film's detailing can only let us down: the characters can never really surprise us and after a while we grow restless as Trainwreck delays the inevitable. The film's normativity is especially disappointing when we move from the aesthetic to the political. Yes, Amy's hedonism is affirmed as a feminist rejoinder to our culture's ongoing Madonna/whore complex, but it's ultimately still a sickness only monogamy can cure. Will we ever see a truly radical realism wherein rich, full, compassionate lives are lived free of romantic attachments and it's the need for commitment that's pathologized? But I realize this is a ridiculous demand to make of a film that, like its 50s forebears, ensconces its leads in aspirational fantasies of Manhattanite affluence and unabashedly tokenizes its few characters of color, laboring mightily under the illusion that cracking jokes about having black friends neutralizes any racial oversights (another affliction Apatow and Schumer share). But then, the good: Trainwreck is frequently hilarious. Schumer gets a lot of comic mileage out of the simple inversion of the sexually voracious woman steamrolling through hapless, smitten men, drawing some of her biggest laughs from the ingenue routine she uses to assuage her lovers' egos and get exactly what she wants ("You know what? I’m like really shy, so we should probably do this first till I feel comfortable with you," she tells one conquest as she guides his head to her crotch). These scenes, compiled into the film's first act, typify a balance of farce and realism that Apatow only occasionally achieves. It helps that he's very much an actor's director, with a particular talent for drawing complex performances from unlikely sources. John Cena, for one, is a revelation in early scenes as Schumer's sweet but lunkheaded main squeeze. He's a cartoon of gym rat hypermachismo, but when he realizes his investment in the relationship far outpaces Schumer's, his heartbreak is rather stunningly convincing. (He also delivers a monologue describing the life he imagined for them together which, in its unabashed desire to fit Amy into a predetermined role, represents the film's all-too-brief exploration of the self-absorbed and delusional side of monogamous desire.) Colin Quinn is also effective as Schumer's scabrous, MS-stricken father - perhaps less surprising, considering Quinn's stage persona as a tristate blowhard - especially when using his daughters' dolls to explain his separation from their mother (a scene that is gut-bustingly funny until, as is so often the case, Apatow and Schumer hammer their point home, with Quinn leading his children in a mantra: "Monogamy isn't realistic!"). For her part, Schumer is best in the subtler moments between shtick and mawkishness. The offhand confidence with which she seduces Bill Hader's Aaron for the first time is almost scarily convincing. (Or, maybe I've just encountered too many Amy's of my own.) Far less convincing is the choreographed dance routine (and slapstick switcheroo) that ends the film, with Billy Joel's "Uptown Girl" no less - a sentimental touch I don't know if I could ever forgive.
Schumer’s script is amusing but too conventional. She is frequently upstaged by her supporting cast (e.g. James, Lena, Hader, etc).
did it for bill. laughed with john cena. stayed for lebron.
did I thirst watch a movie for Bill Hader? who’s to say
i really cant stand amy schumer but this was ok i guess
Brie Larson, the ray of sunshine in this weird ass world.
Some of the humor becomes a trainwreck, Bill Hader is under-utilized, but for the most part the movie works.
this was one of the worst movies i’ve ever seen amy schumer is not funny
The only thing I remember about this movie is that on the way to the theater I unintentionally egged on a fight between the couple I was sharing a Lyft with
Could have been wreckier. And funnier. And less long. Oh right, Judd Apatow. Shoulda known. John Cena's naked body looks like a photoshopped poster my sister made when we were teens for a made up Matthew Broderick porno... who has a cameo in this. Huh.
Exaggerated! Just a normal love story.
"I just want you to know, my safe word is 'pineapple'."  Trainwreck is an ok movie by Judd Apatow. It was too long in my opinion and it would have benefited if it had been shorter. Bill Hader was great though and Amy Schumer wasn't as annoying as I thought she'd be.
- Lots of laughs - John Cena and Lebron James were in it, and both were hilarious
It's 12am, boyfriend is trying to convince me to watch a bad horror movie. I say no, he insists. I say OKAY, he decides nothing on Netflix is bad enough. Enter Trainwreck. I honestly don't know how this happened, I dislike Amy Schumer as much as the next person.  Two years ago I tried to watch this on a plane but the first 5 minutes drove me away so I watched Mad Max instead. You see, in this day and age I can tolerate bad movies (THE KISSING BOOTH) because I actually laugh at how horrible they are (THE KISSING BOOTH) still, I never thought I'd be watching this AND realizing it's not bad.
Well...that certainly felt like a Judd Apatow movie. I'll say this - John Cena, and Lebron James were pretty funny. I can only care so much about whether privileged rich people want to have a 'conventional' relationship or not though, and this goes about 30-40 minutes past where that line is for me. Amy Schumer and Bill Hader were fine. Nice to see a Claudia O'Doherty cameo, and Colin Quinn is a great scumbag Dad. Also....um...I forgot everything else about this movie mid-review.
How random is Lebron in this movie? Funny. Witty. Love Amy.
Trainwreck is a trainwreck.
ANYWAY..... I just know that Bill Hader would treat me right!!!
I don't enjoy watching Amy Schumer, but despite that I do enjoy this movie.
you pathetic childless milf
that one star is for brie larson, ezra miller and bill hader the half star is for that movie they were watching in the cinema that had daniel radcliffe and marisa tomei in it
I really miss 90 minutes comedies, but I can't complain about that in an Apatow movie since this feeling of exaustion is part of his project as a filmmaker. Not that it works for me (comedy is about tight pacing), but I respect that. That said, can we have a spin-off about Tilda Swinton's character?
straight nonsense feat. amy schumer
Observations: - Tilda Swinton was unrecognizable  - John Cena naked was disturbing  - John Cena & Amy Schumer was ... something - Bill Hader looks kinda good? - LeBron James? Alright, didn’t see that coming - Ezra Miller & Amy was ... something .. too - Ezra Miller is still THE man - Brie Larson is such a babe - Pretty decent movie  Many thoughts processing ...
it wasn’t the worst thing i’ve ever seen but tbh i just watched for bill hader amy schumer is a fucking demon. she’s not funny in this movie and her improv-y moments are nauseating lmao. that being said, bill hader has great comedic timing and so does lebron james weirdly enough??? their relationship was kinda cute so i’ll give it that. and yeah i’d die for bill hader thnx for coming to my ted talk
Bill Hader is fucking hot. Fight me.  I’m a huge sap, and the final scene gets me every time.
Tilda Swinton is so fucking good in this
The first third of this movie was jokes about sex, then Lebron came in. Bill Hader was good but the script, plot, and really everything about this movie was not. So many parts of this movie didn’t matter, including her dad dying. For a 2hr watch, you’d expect more.
god i hate this movie so much but bill looks so good, the duality of a film
A typical flick and what I expected
I’m even more in love with bill and I didn’t think that was possible
movie name is accurate
i'm so pissed about the fact that i find bill hader hot now
Boring, not very funny, not even that bad in the sense of being raunchy. Probably wouldn't watch again
Lebron is the GOAT.
LeBron and Cena are the best parts of this movie. Hader of course is lovable and great. Amy Schumer is even pretty funny in this. Maybe not as good as it was heralded but still good.
I liked when she was in the movie theatre drinking out of 2 boxes of wine, because I too was in the theatre drinking out of 2 boxes of wine.
Extra points for bill hader... the love of my life
6.0 /10 Watched this because Judd Apatow's other movie Knocked Up is awesome and because I really like Bill Hader and some of the other actors in this. It's alright. The first 20-30 minutes are really funny, but then the film becomes a mix of funny and serious scenes and that makes it kinda boring in some scenes. ( Don't understand me wrong, the movie is still enjoyable. ) The final minutes are really good again. Overall Trainwreck could have been better, but at least it's enjoyable and likeable.
Every Judd Apatow movie is thirty minutes too long. There’s a scene wherein one joke is essentially repeated several times with different wording (the group hug scene), and Apatow leaves it all in there. Just pick one, man. Cut some stuff. Hader’s great, Larson’s great, Colin Quinn is great, but there isn’t very much to cling to in this fun but otherwise disposable rom-com.
Damnit Amy Schumer is in cool interesting character driven quiet drama romances that make me laugh and showcase fun, flawed women who change! I enjoy!
Aside from the reversal of gender roles, this was a fairly straightforward rom-com. Amy Schumer was very funny, but it couldn't quite carry the film.
Judd Apatow and Amy Schumer's "Trainwreck" will surprise audiences in a plethora of ways. First, who knew Amy Schumer could successfully utilize her raunchy style of comedy for a story that not only has a lot of intelligent humor but also a lot heart with a deep message?! Who knew that they were actually going to cry during this?! Who knew that Bill Hader and Amy Schumer would work as a convincing pair of charming romantic leads?! And who knew that Colin Quinn, John Cena and Lebron James were good comedic actors?! "Trainwreck" is easily one of my favorites of 2015 with a story about a kind of woman that Amy Schumer gives a genuine insight into and pulls it off with an outstanding, yet unlikely cast.
Amy Schumer is a comedy assassin. Proof is in her hit Comedy Central series, Inside Amy Schumer, which takes on everything from rape culture to Hollywood sexism to Bill Cosby. Proof is also now in her starring role in Trainwreck. As star and screenwriter–with director Judd Apatow wisely harnessing her comic skills instead of stifling them–Schumer is a wonder of comic talent with an assault on sexism and man attitudes that hits hard. Amy is Amy Townend, a writer for a men’s magazine run by an editor (a terrifically hilarious Tilda Swinton) who has a fondness for headlines such as ‘Are You Gay Or Is She Just Boring?’ Amy is tasked with interviewing Aaron Conners (Bill Hader), a sports-medicine doctor who tends to the celebrity likes of LeBron James (absolutely hilarious) and Amar’e Stoudemire. Sounds like a set-up for love, but hang on. Amy, sporting a mouth fueled by booze, weed and a clueless, neglectful father (a wonderful Colin Quinn) is game to hook up with almost any guy and then dump them. Aaron isn’t quite one of those dudes, though the brilliant Hader, whose comic and dramatic skills hit a new peak, imbues him with complications. These two don’t go together easy, and that’s how Schumer likes it. Schumer takes rom-com cliches and explodes them, replacing them with something fierce and tougher. Here’s to getting more of that from her.
just kinda survived through this for bill
Like 5 mins into the movie Amy and her friend are talking about which version of Johnny Depp they would have sex with, so real fast I knew I wasn’t the targeted demographic of this movie  (Brie Larson I love you to death but please don’t even make me watch something like that ever again)
I legit just watched this for Judd Apatow, Brie, Bill and the two seconds of Leslie Jones and Pete Davidson
Okay, I’m not really a big Amy Schumer fan. And the first half of this film she is so unlikeable, like I actually wanted to slap her and tell her to shut up!  Brie Larson is queen though! And bill header! I’ve never really seen any of his films but he really stood out in this film.  Ezra miller was a nice surprise too, he’s just gorgeous!  A nice little film. That last scene with the dancing made the whole film better for me!  Oh and what’s up with tilda swinton in this! Haha she looks so different!
I caught a bit of this on TV just kind of coincidentally and it was at the argument between Amy and Brie Larson at the funeral. It seems like a scene out of a fake movie that characters in a real movie would watch. I had a physical reaction to Amy keeping Bill Harder’s character up to argue the night before his big surgery. Fuck this movie. Fuck this movie so much.  Fuck Amy Schumer.
"Oohhh my boi got intimate, sexual intercourse" Lebron James and John Cena forcing me to rewind every scene they're in made this a damn near 3 hour experience. I'm not the biggest fan of Amy schumer but she made a really funny movie with a magical ensemble cast. I still hate that ending though  "I'm gonna give you my full pecker"
"I once fucked three-quarters of Pink Floyd. Yeah. Dark Side of ALL their moons." The cameos and the supporting cast are really the best part of this movie. Also, 129 minutes is about 30-40 minutes longer than what this film should've been.
Bill Hader cant not be funny cmon guys
I am a fan of Judd Apatow and Amy Schumer, but I was not a huge fan of this film. It had funny parts, but overall I found the main character to be too unlikable for me to really empathize with her. I probably won't watch it again.
First half was much better than the last. Tilda Swinton baffled me- I didn’t even clock that it was her and I’m glad I finally found out where those photos of Daniel Radcliffe and the dogs came from.
