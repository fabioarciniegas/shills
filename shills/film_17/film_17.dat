What do we learn from this? Don't get dickmatised. Don't get married without a prenup. Record everything. Learn to fake being injured/dick/tired. Practise running in high heels.
90% of this is Joan Crawford just looking around the room wide eyed and it's great
Sudden Fear is a classic “I think my husband is trying to kill me” melodrama starring Joan Crawford as a wealthy playwright who marries an aspiring actor (Jack Palance) whose greatest role is convincing her that he’s the perfect man. What makes Sudden Fear so good is that it never spends any time mucking around with the “I think my husband might be trying to kill me” stuff. When the dominoes fall, they all fall at once, and it’s a case of “I know my husband is trying to kill me, what do I do now?!?” Sudden Fear starts out slowly, and it’s mostly a case of style over substance, but the second half is so tightly constructed and all the actors are so good that it’s hard not to get caught up in the clockwork plotting.
A playwright marries a man only to find out his girlfriend wants to help him kill her to get her inheritance. What follows is an excellent execution of fear and suspence as she works to try and foil their plans. This is one of my favourite Joan Crawford movies. She's a fantastic actress and the way she uses her face and eyes with such fear and emotion in some of the scenes is a credit to her silent film days. Definitely worth checking out, its brilliant.
Viewed in DCP in Cohen Media’s 2016 2K digital restoration at the Seattle Art Museum’s Plestcheeff Auditorium.
Two great actors playing actors who can't let the other know they're acting.
The movie drags in the middle and could use some tightening up overall, but the last 25 minutes make it all worth it.
Lol, I think I was much less into the thriller/ suspense aspects that take hold in the second half. I'm not sure but maybe because contemporary shooting styles and sound design can be so much more sophisticated that earlier movies when trying to ramp up suspense can seem like a raw deal. I actually think many older movies excel when staying quieter or more eloquent, and of course by writing. Otto Preminger's Laura for example; he has a quite characteristic paced style, I really like it in Advise & Consent too. But in another example I tried to watch North By Northwest again recently, and I was amazed at how much I just couldn't connect with the sensibility. But Sudden Fear starts very well for me, I'm not a Crawford superfan but I get the appeal. Cohen Media's restorations and blurays are a treasure as usual though, for another thriller-y one released by them that I'm much more on board with check out Claude Chabrol's Nightcap. With Isabel Huppert, a bunch of rich hot chocolate and a husband who needs his rohypnol. But seriously, have watched it at least twice it's an eloquent film.
The "Sudden Fear" of the title is what Miss Crawford experiences when she discovers that the young actor she has married, (an excellent and Oscar-nominated early performance from Jack Palance), is planning to murder her. David Miller's thriller is both extremely enjoyable and highly implausible with Joan pulling out all the stops and also picking up an Oscar nomination for her trouble. The movie marked something of a late career boost for her and was largely instrumental in launching Palance who clearly had a knack for playing the bad guy. As Mr Palance's partner-in-crime Gloria Grahame seems to be having a lot more fun here than she did in the overrated "The Bad and the Beautiful".
David Miller directs this Oscar-nominated classic film-noir, adapted from the novel of the same name by Edna Sherry, about a woman who accidentally discovers that her husband is plotting to murder her. Following a tumultuous courtship, commended author Myra Hudson (Joan Crawford) ties the knot with Lester Blaine (Jack Palance), a glossy actor she has just sacked from her latest production. Shortly after the honeymoon, Myra eavesdrops Lester and his lover, Irene (Gloria Grahame), coming up with plans to murder the rich playwright for her legacy. Devastated by the exposure, Myra pulls herself together and devises a revenge plan. But will her troubled ideas work? Or will it all end in disaster? Joan Crawford gives a terrific performance – one of the best of her career – playing the role of Myra Hudson, the acclaimed playwright who acts like she is determined to try and defend herself in the best way she possibly can after accidentally overhearing what her husband and his lover plan to do to her. She suits her role really well and makes the most of the time she has on the screen. Elsewhere, Jack Palance is excellent and Gloria Grahame is respectable in their respective roles as Lester Blaine and Irene Neves, Myra’s husband and Lester’s lover who plan to murder Myra so they can get very rich. They both suit their roles well, but Grahame perhaps will be more remembered for her part in The Bad and the Beautiful, which won her an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress. Bruce Bennett, Virginia Huston and Mike Connors play the roles of Steve Kearney, Ann Taylor and Junior Kearney to a fine standard. The direction from Miller is excellent because he allows the facial expressions to be seen to a strong effect throughout, while also keeping a tense atmosphere happening on occasions as well and the script is written to a terrific standard by Lenore J. Coffee and Robert Smith as they make the movie easy to follow. The technical aspects that stand out best in glorious black-and-white are the set, camera and costume, because the set is decent to view throughout; the camera makes very good use of the locations and also captures the tense and dramatic moments really well, which deservedly get the edge-of-the-seat status; the costumes are very nicely designed. The movie managed to win 4 Academy Award nominations: Best Actor (Jack Palance), Best Actress (Joan Crawford), Best Cinematography, Black-and-White (Charles Lang) and Best Costume Design, Black-and-White (Sheila O’Brien) and those nominations were deserved. Joan Crawford also rightly got a Golden Globe nomination for Best Actress – Drama. Overall, Sudden Fear is a film-noir that absolutely deserves to have its classic status. This works really well due to the excellent performances from Joan Crawford and Jack Palance, along with the excellent direction, well written script and technical aspects. One of the best films to have been made in the year of this release.
A real nail-biter this one, with an outstanding performance by Joan Crawford. Who suffers agonies like her? No-one! I do think a whirlwind passion for sinister Jack Palance strains credulity a little, but it’s a great watch. Great photography, especially draws you in with the many close-ups of Crawford and her rollercoaster emotions. And clever use of scenes that she’s imagining when she finds out the truth and also her plans on revenge. We can literally see her mind working overtime. A really tense and splendid ending.
I was well and sufficiently suspensed. Joan’s brows do all the heavy lifting.
Slow, slow burner, suspence pic, that mostly rewards your patience.  Some nice images: shadow of clock hands ticking across Crawford’s terror stricken face, Palance’s wild eyes, lit by a handheld light, searching the dark hilly streets for his lover and prey.
Possibly one of Joan Crawford's best performances as a woman in distress who is immersed in the deepest paranoia. The tension is excellently rendered with David Miller's taut direction and Charles Lang's beautiful black and white photography. Jack Palance is also a standout with his odd physical presence contributing to his strange mix of earnestness and menace.
Is there a word for the subgenre of noir movies about women whose husbands are trying to kill them? Anyway, they're my favorite. Second Joan Crawford movie on my Ranker 100 Project and it becomes clear that I've been sleeping on her completely. I guess I think of myself as being on team Bette, but that's stupid on multiple levels. She's great. There's a scene in this movie where she's frantically searching for something, so she panics while stomping around in strappy heels and a fur coat. It's the best.
That third act is sublime, with wonderfully choreographed sequences of almost unbearable tension that avoid feeling cliché or tired. Love the clock motif, and there are some creative plot decisions—the “twisted” ankle, the  time-table visualization, the wind-up toy, the use of the apartment and streets of San Francisco—as well as some clever subversions, such as the beach house.
Crawford, Palance, and Grahame are all phenomenal.
to be fair, driving in san francisco is never easy
It’s amazing that there’s still a decent amount of suspense in this film with a plot that is very contrived. Joan Crawford and Jack Palance are good in the lead roles, but hardly worth the nominations they both received. This is a beautifully shot film though with great lighting during the final act.
wish i didn't read about this before seeing it because i would've loved the ending much more. the female leads in this could do way better than jack palance and his skeleton face but whatever
damned good leads, lighting, and editing.  especially that third act!  would be great to watch back to back with mildred pierce
Don't mess with Joan, yo. This isn't Doris Day in Midnight Lace; Joan's got some serious resilience chops. Good suspense.
For a moment, I thought I was about to watch Joan Crawford in a completely non terrifying, murderous, or off-putting movie. Boy, was I wrong.
God damn, Joan Crawford is the greatest.
That chase scene... and Joan is especially vulnerable, even more than usual.
Joan in a thriller is my kinda Joan!!
When Joan Crawford is on, she is fucking on! And, incidentally, she's got some fantastic hair in this that just cannot be ignored.
I want to be Myra Hudson
my favorite genre: guys who try to steal an Oscar-winning actress's shit getting fucked up in shadowy expensive locations
I especially like that wonderful scene with the pendulum’s shadow of the ticking clock over Joan Crawford’s dark, intense look, while we see her murder plan step by step carefully visualised: film noir at its best.
Great noir film. Jack Palance, with his ever-grinning face, is fabulous in this (you can see foreshadows of his mob boss face in Batman). A brilliant story of an actor who tricks a genuine spirit into falling in love with him out of revenge for firing him. In the process, she discovers his plan to murder her and take her fortune through an ingenious plot device. So she sets about his ruination, conniving a brilliant plan to murder him and frame his lover. But, because she's a moral person, she discovers she lacks the will to kill him. As a result, all hell breaks loose - her plan spirals out of control and leads to the title's fearful climax. The final 10-15 minutes are really well done - nerve-wracking, exciting, nailbiting. And it has the first noir ending, accidental justice. There is some wonderful camera work with shadows in this film, and some create film techniques, including closeups of Joan Crawford's face when she's having her panic attacks that really sell her scenes in which her fear has gotten the better of her. Great film, highly recommended!
Solid noir thriller. Not without its faults, but well done. Jack Palance is a great menace. Crawford is choice as the aging sweetheart with a penchant for payback. A wealthy playwright, who married for love, discovers her new husband is going to kill her in three days. She hatches a counter-scheme, but something goes wrong. The plot, loaded with twists and turns, thins out by the end. It’s a normal amount of story spread over a lot of time. Though, honestly, not a bad way to spend 1h 50m.
145 YEARS OF CINEMA Nr. / Year: 1952 Country: U.S.A. David Miller directs Joan Crawford in this noir inspired psycho-drama that has a very unusual style for the time, in that it balances hapless romance of the first half of the film with a gender role reversal murder plot in the second half - Jack Palance plays Lester Blaine, a young actor who seduces famous playwrite Myra Hudson (Crawford), who is also incidentally the heiress to a large fortune. Lester's character is a play on the stock 'femme fatale' archetype from film noir, and uses his charm and good looks to manipulate her; the sudden realisation (or "sudden fear", if you will) of Myra's suspicions is framed with a very clever storytelling device - she overhears a recording of his conversation with another woman in her office about their plans to get rid of her. Crawford displays a great talent here, showing off a range of startling emotions in a well directed and quietly intense scene. There are some other disturbing moments as well, like a dream scene where she is killed in different ways; or the scene when she has a fantasy about carrying out her plan for revenge. It's all rather starkly morbid, compared to other films of the time, and really immerses you into the desperate situation this woman is put through. Near the end of the film, some scenes could have been shortened, as I felt they dragged on for too long, but otherwise "Sudden Fear" is a compelling drama, and beautifully scored by composer Elmer Bernstein, and gorgeous photography of Los Angeles by Charles Lang (I think I saw clips of this movie in "Los Angeles Plays Itself" from 2004, but I may be wrong).
"I was just wondering what I'd done to deserve you." Sudden Fear sounded like it could be a good one and it was. It starts off pretty good, but it's one of those that just gets better and better as it goes along. I liked the story and the different directions it went in and it build up tension quite nicely. Joan Crawford is very good in the lead role and Jack Palance and Gloria Grahame provide strong support. I enjoyed this one quite a bit. 7.5/10
Joan Crawford is amazingly good in this. The last chasing scene makes you hold your breath.
Joan Crawford was exceptional and her facial expressions alone deserved an Oscar. Just wish there was more dialogue or even voiceover from Myra in the last third of the film or so. It was challenging at times to follow her motivations and line of thought.
A really smartly written movie that is an interesting take on the spouse trying to kill off their spouse genre. I mean it is a very suspenseful movie and the acting by everyone, in perticular Joan Crawford, is great. I just think a lot of stupid moves were done by Joan’s character in the movie that made this a little disdainful. I mean girl if you’ve planned and started your revenge you can’t backtrack out of it at the last second. I mean everyone got what they deserved in the end and yeah go Joan Crawford and your playwright ass. Also loved the San Francisco location as it made the end of the film especially exciting.
*insert gif of Joan Crawford shooting Jack Palance in the back*
Joan Crawford does fear really good. When she's trying to act romantic or sophisticated or just about anything else, her acting is usually horrible and intolerable. But she has a real flair for fear. There's a long scene where she's hiding in a closet for the longest time, and all you see is her face for about 5 minutes. And she's awesome doing it. It was kind of mesmerizing to me.
Jack Palance is one of those actors who really aged into his looks. As an older actor, he had a distinctive appearance, but as a young man he looked frankly pretty weird! So weird, in fact, that they made a movie about it, called Sudden Fear. Joan Crawford plays a Broadway playwright/heiress who chooses not to cast Jack Palance and his enormous, gleaming face as a romantic lead. Later, he resurfaces in her life and they fall in love! But has Palance really turned a corner, or is it all just a ruse for revenge? Joan Crawford does a better job than this movie probably deserves, and Palance finds himself in the awkward position of being the leading man in a movie about how he isn't leading man material. And it's sort of right!
Interesting but watch only if.... a. You like Joan Crawford. This is a great performance by her. b. You really like film noir. This isn't the best but there are several scenes that will linger with you. Personally, I think the story is worthy of a remake. The writers, IMHO, missed a lot of possibilities for fearful turns.
It hurts my brain to see Jack Palance as anything other than wrinkly.
I enjoy Crawford in her noirs, and this is no different, even if she's more hysteric than strong here... But, like Barbara Stanwyck in 'Sorry, Wrong Number', her histrionics work for me. Add Palance in a creepy but subtle role and Grahame at her slutty best (her voice alone in this movie is enough to drive a man mad), and you got a great ménage à trois. The final half hour or so is sublime and tense (even if the climax is a bit of a cop out), I forgot exactly how suspenseful it is.
Joan acts SO HARD in this movie and I loved it.
Crawford excels as the playwright caught up in Jack Palance and Gloria Grahame's machinations. For a film all about plots and secrets It's pretty clear from the very start exactly how everything is going to break down but Crawford really is excellent throughout, her age and experience deepening the role and bringing out all sorts of extra nuance.
A young Jack Palance Was made of 90 percent Cheekbones. Damn, sister! 1001plus.blogspot.com/2018/05/where-theres-will-i-want-to-be-in-it.html
As if anyone wouldn't be 100% madly and truly in love with Joan Crawford like Gloria is pretty but COME ON
It seems like I'm one of just a few that doesn't seem to like this picture. The story is that Crawford gets involved with wax sculpture Jack Palance but finds out she's been played and plans revenge. For a noir thriller Sudden Fear is quite boring and the scenes that are actually suspenseful are few and far between thanks to the slack pacing and yawn-inducing story. The actors do their best but they can't save this film from crushing mediocrity. Since the film isn't really worth talking about I would like to talk about what I thought about Joan during the film. She gives a good performance and I began to think about her and her rivalry with Bette Davis. It should be obvious that I'm #TeamJoan but I love both actresses. Nobody plays bad quite like Bette Davis but I think Crawford had better range, and since this movie was boring enough I spent most of my time watching her acting. Crawford has more of an expressiveness to her face while Davis has a little more biting delivery with dialogue, I think this may go back to Crawford getting her start in silent films while Davis started in talkies. Just some interesting thoughts I had while watching.
Very fun suspense thriller in which a conniving actor (played by Jack Palance) seduces and marries a successful playwright (Joan Crawford), then schemes with his girlfriend (Gloria Grahame) to kill his new wife. What gives the film its particular sting is that Crawford discovers the plan about halfway through, then spends the second half concocting her own scheme. The way in which those two conflicting plans play out is hugely entertaining, particularly since Palance and Crawford are both great at showing the fraying seams of the performances that their characters are putting on for those around them.
Watched for the Queer Film Challenge 2018 Week 50 - Joan Crawford Very slow burn in this film, not once but twice. When is Palance going to turn into the bad guy? Everything seems like it's going so well, doesn't it? Ah, now we see what's going on, and so does Joan, but what is she going to do about it? The pacing in this film is incredible, and such great foreshadowing as well as false foreshadowing. And once again, San Francisco stands out as the best place to film movies.
I continue to be enthralled by Joan Crawford's abundant talent and magnificent screen presence.
"Why do you look at me like that?" "I was just wondering what I'd done to deserve you."
First of all, I watched this movie because I'm getting ready for Anna Biller's upcoming "Bluebeard" movie: Anna Biller Productions, BLUEBEARD MOVIE (giving her the promo she deserves). I really enjoyed this film! At first, when she started panicking about her husband wanting her dead, I thought "She's definitely not gonna make it, she's gonna die". That's why it really surprised me to see her doing everything to coming out alive and see her accomplishing it. I'm glad I watched this movie, that ending was worth all the sweet tension and the illusion scene was amazing, I'm a big fan of that kind of scenes.
I didn’t breathe once those last 15 minutes
You'll be hard pressed to find a Joan Crawford performance reaching more agitated states of frenzy and overwrought anguish than in Sudden Fear, but the real star of the show is Hollywood top-cinematographer Charles B. Lang Jr who properly elevates chiaroscuro lighting, expressionistic shadow play and the nighttime wet-down of city streets to new heights of artistic excellence in classic Film Noir.
Joanie just about reins-in her OTT-ness, but also is quite subtle at times. Superb thriller. Turned onto it by Anna Biller (again!) talking about it on Switchblade Sisters podcast www.maximumfun.org/switchblade-sisters/switchblade-sisters-episode-8-sudden-fear-anna-biller
Mulholland Drive played straight and behind the scenes. Delightfully old fashioned fun.
Sudden Fear for me was as surprising and yet wonderfully thrilling noir with Crawford who does literally everything in this film to save her life from her wannabe murderous husband and his mistress. The gorgeous cinematography is some of the best I've seen. The darkness being used a lot more prominently than the light to show the dark nature of the film. What a great film with many shocking moments.
In an effort to watch more Joan Crawford movies I suggested that my BF and I watch this on my birthday. I made a good choice with this one, as it's a great movie with Joan in it. Surprisingly her last Best Actress Nomination at the Oscars, which was definitely deserved for the role. Sudden Fear is about a woman whose husband and mistress are out to kill for her for fortune. She stealthy comes up with her own plan in what unfolds in a very suspenseful way. It's the kind of movie that has many twists and turns and you're always wondering what's going to happen next. Don't mess with Joan Crawford.
Film #5 of Scavenger Hunt #34 - January 2018 Task #24 'A film that you expect to be bad, but you really want to see it anyway.' My full list here. I honestly expected Sudden Fear to be a schlocky horror melodrama (mostly based on the poster) and it turned out to be an incredibly well crafted noir thriller. Joanie in that silk scarf ready to kill a man... seriously good cinema. Loved the end sequence in particular, definite Third Man/Mildred Pierce vibes.
It's Joan Crawford vs. Jack Palance. If you need to know more, I don't need to know you. I kind of want to get Joan Crawford's eyes from this movie tattooed on my hands....
the teNSION
Sudden Fear inverts the usual gender roles assigned in traditional noir, scoring a critical and creative success signaling the second coming of Crawford as a star. The plot is taught and intricate, the reveal through technology surely an inspiration for countless plots to come. Palance and Gloria Grahame are perfectly paired as a wicked couple who we cheer against and take utter delight in their ultimate karmic payment. Classic.
She could have just divorced him!!
Continuing my study of noir, I saw "Sudden Fear" last night. In some ways perhaps a little outdated, still as the film develops, you get caught up in the suspence and terror. Learned some new things for my next film. I was surprised how well Jack Palance did on this. Joan Crawford is not everyone's cup of tea but whatever you may think, she is a powerful actress.
this was...... really good.
Saint Joan, suffering.
This film continues to reaffirm my opinion that getting married is a terrible idea because men are awful
Deranged melodramatics color this story of manipulation, exploitation, and vengeance, with Crawford and Palance marvelously baroque evocations of a feminine resilience and the bitter, fragile male ego, their pas de deux a richly theatrical power game that hinges on the conflict between Palance world need pride and Crawford’s heart-broken sense of betrayal. Palance’s barely concealed oily manipulation, his dark eyes gleaming with ulterior motivation, instills the film’s first half with a tragic ill-fatedness as Crawford’s joy and confidence becomes delusional and the prancing seductions of Graham’s weasely temptress twist the knife of betrayal ever further. The turn then, captured by Crawford’s marvelously expressive silent performance in all its historionic agony in an extended scene that sees her bliss collapse into a desolate abyss, comes with a righteous force, a swell of feminine fury and outrage that instills the ensuing plotting with a potent moral ambiguity as Crawford’s sense of justice and need for vengeance crash against her humanity, a tense internal conflict that is only resolved in the film’s closing moments as Crawford, silently expressive, again evokes a tumult of emotions with the evocative power of her grand performance.
Film noir is a genre that I always love visiting, even if I don't that often. This is a great example of film noir, and just an extremely suspenseful movie. Interestingly, the gender dynamic here is somewhat shifted from the norm, where a femme fatale seduces the unwitting protagonist and leads him astray. Here, Joan Crawford, an incredible actress, is a playwright who just so happens to run across the same actor she had previously fired, and then fall in love. We soon discover that his whole plan was to marry her and then quickly ensure her death, in order to gain her fortune she will inherit. One of the reasons I really liked this film was the way that it played with dramatic irony. The husband chooses to kill the protagonist due to his discovery of an old copy of her will, which contains a provision that prevents him from remarrying on her death. In a previous scene, she removed that exact portion of her will. The film still does have a femme fatale, in the form of a secondary antagonist, lover of the husband. But unlike a more traditional film, where the blame lies almost solely on the femme fatale, attacking the woman as the cause of all the problems, the blame is on the husband, and his own leaping to conclusions.
Joan Crawford (Mildred Pierce) stars as a wealthy playwright who falls head over heels with an actor, played by Jack Palance (City Slickers, Ripley's Believe It or Not), and quickly marries him. Trouble ensues, however, when she finds out that the actor's feelings toward her might not be entirely genuine, especially since he is still involved with an old girlfriend, and since he stands to come into a lot of money from her estate in the event of her death. One of my favorite classic actresses, Gloria Grahame (In a Lonely Place, It's a Wonderful Life) is at her sexiest, sleaziest, and slimiest as the husband's old girlfriend. Sudden Fear is one of the better woman-in-distress film noir movies out there, and the final moments in the shadowy alleyways of nighttime San Francisco are brilliant. I assume that most of you who are reading this own the Rolling Stones album, Exile on Main St. The still of Joan Crawford on the album sleeve is taken from Sudden Fear.
Do not fuck with Joan Crawford. I repeat. DO. NOT. FUCK. WITH. JOAN. CRAWFORD. Sudden Fear is a tense Hitchcockian thriller elevated by a performance from the legendary actress that encapsulates what exactly it was that made her a star. Crawford's Myra Hudson is a compelling mix of delicacy and strength; sensitive enough to fall in love but self-assured enough to deal with things when the shit hits the fan. The film begins with a fairly typical noir setup that serves mostly to assemble the pieces and introduce a series of Chekov's guns. Early on you'll notice a certain cinematic polish; like the way light and shadow happen to fall in just so revealing ways on Crawford and Jack Palance (whose impossibly angular face makes him perfect for the role of the film's bluebeard). At this point, Sudden Fear is a good film, but nothing you haven't seen before. It's only after a particular scene partway through involving Myra's dictaphone that the film takes a turn into something sharper. The scene itself requires Crawford to do nothing more than react to a voice for an extended period of time, and she nails this with a verisimilitude and grace that feels entirely natural for the character. From this point on, Sudden Fear becomes a tense machine of gemlike precision, as Myra coldly puts into motion a complex plan that isn't quite revealed to the audience. And watching Myra set her plan into motion is a ton of fun, especially with the mileage David Miller gets out of the varying levels of awareness each character has. But its her initial reaction that marks Myra as such a fascinating character. Early in the film we see her as a softer and warmer woman than her perfectionist devotion to her plays would suggest; willing to be swept away by the idea of love. But when she discovers her betrayal, she doesn't waste time with a teary eyed breakdown, she springs into action to save her own life without a second thought. A lot rides on Crawford's performance, and she delivers flawlessly. A hidden gem of film-noir that deserves to be rediscovered.
Good script, great direction, and flipping amazing acting.
David Miller turns out to be a fine jack of all trades -- he does right by the melodramatic moments (cf. Crawford's silent-movie-worthy shock when she discovers the truth), he makes like a serviceable Hitchcock substitute while setting up various dominos (and one significant misdirect), and the ending sequence features moments that stack up with the best moments in any film noir -- but I really wish he was a master of at least one of them. If I had my druthers, I'd rather he hone his melodramatic chops, so those post-reveal moments between Crawford and Palance really pack a punch (& moments like Crawford's change of heart aren't quite so cartoonish). NB: If this film featured more Gloria Grahame, I'd probably be less critical.
Sudden Fear was the ninth feature film directed by David Miller (who also directed revisionist Western classic 'Lonely Are the Brave'), and it stands out as one of the best film noir releases of all time.  The cinematography by Charles Lang (who shot such iconic pictures as 'Sabrina', 'Some Like it Hot', 'The Magnificent Seven', and 'Charade', as well as some of the finest Westerns ever made --- 'The Man from Laramie', 'Gunfight at the O.K. Corral', and 'How the West Was Won') contains some of the best imagery ever to be put on screen.  His use of shadow and contrast between light and dark execute flawlessly the mood that the noir genre attempts to convey with its visual style.  This comes as no surprise, given Lang's photographic work in such film noir classics as 'Ace in the Hole' and 'The Big Heat'.  Every great cinematographer needs a director to be guided by, and Miller orchestrated his masterpiece with ease.  His pace of storytelling is impeccable, bringing to life the screenplay written by Lenore J. Coffee and Robert Smith, adapting Edna Sherry's novel.           Myra Hudson (played by Joan Crawford with her usual melodramatic theatricality --- which is still effective, but will always look over-the-top when placed beside Gloria Grahame's realistic style) is a successful San Franciscan playwright, who also happens to be the daughter of a wealthy family.  When she disagrees with the casting of a lead actor in her new play, based not on acting ability but his inability to appear romantic, and subsequently has him removed from the show, she appears to make an enemy of the man.  However, after running into him at a train station, she is soon wooed by his charm.           Lester Blaine (played by Jack Palance) is a skilled actor, and Myra, being a writer, has a susceptibility to believing in the ideal and wanting it to be reality.  She is taken in by Blaine's confidence and concentrated interest in her.  The two eventually get married, and all seems to be happily ever after.           But any fan of film noir knows that when the plot's circumstances seem to be that rosy, we're really just waiting for the other shoe to drop.  Things are about to go bad --- we don't know how, we don't know why, but we know that's what's coming.  That's part of the charm of a great noir --- that assured inevitability of forthcoming doom and moral corruption.  These stories reveal human nature for what it is with all its flaws, asking for no excuses and offering no apologies.  We are left as viewers to dissect them as we will.            At their wedding reception, Junior Kearney, a lawyer friend of Myra's, arrives with a woman from New York, Irene Neves (played by Gloria Grahame --- arguably the greatest femme fatale in film noir history --- along with Gene Tierney, Ida Lupino, and Barbara Stanwyck).  Lester seems to have a strange reaction to her arrival, almost as if he knows her.         From here, the story takes shape and truly develops its characters, leading them down psychologically harrowing paths, brought to stunning life by Lang's cinematography.  The film's final sequence is among the best ever.         Film noir, in my opinion, is about choices.  There is no good and evil.  We make the decision to be the way we are.  Genetics may play a part, as well as the environment of our upbringing, but when it all comes down to it, we are making the choice to do that bad thing.  That's why these stories are so interesting.  Sometimes the hero isn't a hero at all, but an anti-hero who's just a little less corrupt than the villain themselves.  'In a Lonely Place' comes to mind.  In 'Sudden Fear', the protagonist finds herself with her back to the wall, forced to defend her life at all costs.  However, she is given a choice whether or not to resort to violent means to bring about that self-protection.         Make the right choice and see this film.
Joan Crawford is unlucky in love, getting married to a craggy-faced Jack Palance. What I liked about this one is that about an hour in she discovers the truth about their marriage, and we get another full hour of her dealing with living with a man who she knows is going to try to kill her.
Long after Joan was the queen of MGM and shortly before she revived her career as the queen of high camp horror she tried her hand at the black and white melodrama, and just like everything else she did, she excelled at it. This is one of my favourite Joan eras, she seems so at ease in these kind of roles, using all of her skills as a movie actress to entertain and win over the audience.  Sudden Fear is very theatrical, thrilling and nice to watch, it may not be up there with Humoresque, Mildred Pierce or Autumn Leaves but for Joan fans there's much to enjoy.
Crawford is so good in this that when the first act blatantly foreshadows (or, in the case of the summer house, head-fakes) all of the cliché shit that's going to happen in the remainder, I just got more excited to see her do it. Fairly underwhelming climax but I loved the build-up. Love those location shots of SF in the 50's, too.
*joan crawford does the bare minimum* w OW invented acting
Can you believe it was someone's job to spray fake sweat on Joan Crawford's forehead? Amazing.
My expectation must have been sky high for this movie, considering it gave Crawford her third & final Oscar nominations. And Jack Palance got one as well, probably for his weird looking face. And the performances are awesome, but the movie itself was a let down. Crawford plays Myra Hudson, an uber successful playwright who fires actor Lester Blaine from her latest production, but soon falls in love with and marries him. Pretty quickly, Lester decides he must kill Myra in order to obtain her considerable fortune before she gives it all away. Myra low key finds out about this plan, and is forced to act alone in order to stay alive during a three day weekend when Lester & his sinister old flame Irene decide that it’s the perfect time to kill her. One of the biggest sins of this movie is that it doesn’t handle suspense very well. It’s 50 minutes into the movie before any inkling of a murder is discussed. Lester’s diabolical behavior never comes through. Maybe by design, but I have to believe he’s somewhat evil if he’s going to kill a lady for money. I don’t understand anything about him, what his goals are, what his past life was like. Enter Irene: a standard femme fatale who hints at something like being a con artist or thief, but still offers the same generalities that Lester does. Who are these people? Why do they want money? Are they married or just FWB? I don’t know. The movie is too concerned with cheap thrills to give me some character meat to chew on. Crawford is good in most of the movie. She’s fine during the love story half, but gets a bit terrible during a few scenes in the murder half. Myra’s initial reaction to hearing an accidental recording of her husband & his lover’s murder plan is to immediately grab the recording, climb a ladder & drop it, shattering her only evidence. Why not just leave it? He clearly doesn’t even notice the machine, and all she has to do is take to the police ASAP. What does she do instead? She concocts a convoluted plan I’m assuming was inspired by her plays writing skills. In some parts, she’s in total control of her environment. She easily manipulates her would-be killers like game pieces. She steals Irene’s house key from Lester & makes a copy. She feigns a sprained ankle to keep from a party. She forges notes for both of them in order to place them in the right locations for her plan to work. In all of that she’s quite calm, and it’s satisfying to watch Crawford do her thing in all those scenes. But suddenly, she inexplicably breaks down. She can’t do it anymore & starts to freak. There’s no real reason for this either. It’s just to manufacture some excitement. Nothing happens after that which is true to character. Everything just goes wild. There were some interesting shots. I loved the scene of Myra showing the audience her itinerary, which gives a more satisfying conclusion to her revenge plot than what actually happens. Instead we get poison, a gun & some sleeping pills all of which never get used. It was less of a noir or Suspicion-style revenge thriller than a showcase of Crawford’s underrated acting skills. Her look in that final scene is chilling. A focused plot could have been filled with those scenes, instead of having them scattered throughout.
SAW: at home in HMB
Slowly making my mother a Crawford stan and this was the latest conquest. Her reaction? "Wow, she does not get credit for her acting nearly enough." PREACH IT, MARCIA!
the tension was built so BEAUTIFULLY and joan crawford is the prettiest crier ever
I rented this on Amazon Prime expecting it not to be a good movie and I was super pleasantly surprised. Joan Crawford is incredible in this.
Melodramatic thriller starring Joan Crawford, who shines as the rich wife who learns her husband and his mistress, aptly played by Jack Palance and the always watchable Gloria Grahame, are out to murder her for her money. Crawford sure knows how to dress for a murder.
Jack Palance's alien cheekbones have never looked more chiselled.
My aesthetic is Joan mentally going through her plan to murder her bastard of a husband and looking great while doing it
Latish Crawford entry in the subgenre of "Someone's trying to kill me and I think it's my husband. Joan Crawford plays an independently wealthy woman and a successful playwright. She has Jack Palance fired from her new play for not having enough sex appeal, but when she meets him on her train home from NYC to San Francisco, she seems to have changed her mind. It's all bliss until she discovers that not only does he have a relationship with Gloria Grahame, but that he and his girlfriend have plans to murder her and get to her money. It's up to her to try and thwart them. If you think about Joan Crawford's career, there were probably four phases. I'd classify this as phase three--it's a serious picture, but there are strong hints of the camp and caricature to come. Crawford's wardrobe is just a little too fabulous; her character is a just a little too mannered; and there are some holes in the script (when she finds out what's going on, there's really no reason that I can see why she doesn't either a) just have her husband tossed out on his ear or b) get in the car and get the hell out of there until she can work at option A). Grahame is decent in this and Jack Palance gives a really nice performance. Both he and Crawford got Oscar nominations for their roles. His is warranted. It's a highly watchable film and the locations are beautiful.
Wow, San Francisco as a city comes out even worse in this film than the homocidal husband (played to perfection by a creepy, then somehow debonair, then creepy again Jack Palance). Its inhabitants are selfish and callous -- even to beautiful older women decked out in minks and jewels! If someone was being chased by a killer and asked me to let them into my house for a second to hide, I'd like to think I wouldn't slam my door in their face!! Relationships are also super strange. This is the line Crawford longs to hear from her lover: “You are all the women in my life. You’re the sister I never had, the mother I’ve almost forgotten, the wife I have always dreamed of." Who wants to fulfill someone's incestuous expectations as a sister-mother?! Joan! (Maybe that line is just to clue us in that Crawford's character is no O'Neill but more of the Clare Boothe Luce "lady writer" who might write a hit but nothing for the ages.) But the direction is brilliant, clever and agile, as it works you up to a fevered pitch of excitement and real fear (at least it did this viewer!) - even when you don't know what's going on for a few minutes when Joan is hatching her intricate revenge plans. No scene or shot seems gratuitous. Lots of close-ups of Joan and she makes the most of them! Maybe this wasn't supposed to be funny -- but I thought it was hilarious the way Joan is always five steps ahead of her bungling would-be killers. They have to be real dimwits to believe that each would have had the time to write a note (on their monogrammed stationary no doubt) after Joan foils their poisoning scheme! I also learned of a beautiful book by a Swiss philosopher -- here is a quote from his diaries that's used in the film: "Let mystery have its place in you; do not be always turning up your whole soil with the plowshare of self–examination, but leave a little fallow corner in your heart ready for any seed the winds may bring, and reserve a nook of shadow for the passing bird; keep a place in your heart for the unexpected guests, an altar for the unknown God. Then if a bird sings among your branches, do not be too eager to tame it. If you are conscious of something new – thought or feeling, wakening in the depths of your being – do not be in a hurry to let in light upon it, to look at it; let the springing germ have the protection of being forgotten, hedge it round with quiet, and do not break in upon its darkness; let it take shape and grow, and not a word of your happiness to any one! Sacred work of nature as it is, all conception should be enwrapped by the triple veil of modesty, silence and night."
I bought this new restoration blu ray blindly on Amazon, based on the synopsis and being a sucker for San Francisco films. This is a thrilling, excellent film noir and I'm excited to revisit it soon.
Joan Crawford definitely delivers, stunning and memorable performance. Featuring a decent cast, and script 7/10.
mood: joan crawford dreaming about all the different ways she could die
A wonderfully acted thriller that isn't as thrilling as it should have been. It starts off so well, but then just flatters which leads to an incredibly messy third act that felt like a drag getting to. (I laughed at the ending more than anything) There's a lot of concepts/themes/moods here that I wish they held on which I'm sure would have made it a more exciting film. But if anything, we get a great performance out of Crawford (which for some is enough I guess) and Palance, and the cinematography is pretty great in this film. So yeah, not a bad nor great film, just one I wish took better advantage of it's premise.
I loved Bette Davis first but Joan Crawford is surprisingly super likable. Damn. Guess I can't feed into the feud narrative by picking a side, they're both talented and entertaining to watch on screen.  Sudden Fear is just another film that makes me certain marriage is the most dangerous thing in the world...
Going to be honest -- ten minutes into the film and I was starting to get annoyed. Things were moving too sudden for my liking. First minute she rejects him, then she meets him on the train back home and they're in love?? OKAY then. Once we get past all the unbelievable, poorly paced bullshit that litters the beginning, this film is amazing. Incredible, really. And Crawford swoops in and steals the picture right from the hands of Jack Palance and Gloria Grahame once things get going. Basic gist: Joan Crawford is Myra Hudson, a wealthy heiress and playwright based out of San Diego who just launched a hit show. She fires, and then subsequently proceeds to fall in love with the brooding, creepy looking Lester Blaine (Palance) and marries him. Things start to go awry when she discovers his true intentions: marrying and murdering her for money so he can live happily with his lover, Irene (Grahame). Seeing Crawford react and respond to the revelation of intended murder is perhaps my favorite part of the film (aside from the end, but no spoilers here!) She is chilling to watch -- in the scenes that follow where she has to engage with Blaine after just learning his true intent, you can see the sheer terror that she tries so hard to mask. It's unbelievable -- almost meta acting. Joan Crawford acting as a scared woman acting normal. Other fun tidbits I enjoyed: this film is sex heavy for 1950s standards. Of course, nothing is shown, but there are many references and implications (and even a scene where Palance tries to pull the covers off a naked Crawford, oh my!) Joan, in her mid 40s, looks phenomenal. It is nothing short of pleasing to the eye to see her in such flattering garments. I would absolutely watch this again. 3.5 stars only because of the beginning. And, for the record: AMAZING falling action and ending. Joan deserved that Oscar!!
Myra Hudson (Joan Crawford) is a successful playwright at work on her latest play. She fires the leading man, Lester Blaine (Jack Palance), because she feels he's wrong for the part. She later meets him on a cross-country train trip back to her hometown of San Francisco. Sparks fly and the two wind up tying the knot. And then....well, this IS a film noir. Highly enjoyable suspense flick earned Crawford her third (and final) Oscar nomination. Nifty black & white cinematography makes great use of light and shadow, as well as its 'Frisco locations. Joan's character is a nice change of pace from the usual roles of this type - she's proactive in dealing with her predicament, as opposed to just acting like a victim until the last 5 minutes.
In which Joan Crawford’s wardrobe gets its own title card with credits given to her gowns, furs, hats, jewels, and even her lingerie! Apparently, Crawford read the novel by Edna Sherry between midnight and 4am, and "by daybreak I had Sudden Fear shot and ready for release." In love with the source material and coming off the back of the flop of This Woman is Dangerous, the film she hated more than any other in her filmography, she boldly opted to take 40% of the profits instead of her then $200, 000 fee, a decision which ended up netting the astute actress a cool $1 million. That's not even the best bit of trivia from the commentary track of the new 4K scan recently put out by Cohen Media. Director David Miller was handpicked by Crawford based on their previous working relationship, a job he took on the proviso that he was able to tell the hugely powerful star to "Go F**k yourself" if she tried to steamroll him over significant directorial choices, a stipulation he actually had written into his contract! As for Crawford herself, onscreen, nowhere are her abilities to pull complete, concentrated focus on a scene, better displayed than an extended five-minute sequence of her listening and reacting to a recording; over the course of that time, gradually going from happiness and contentment to the horror and rage of 'peak Joan'. She's maybe the only big star from whom Gloria Graham didn't completely steal the picture, though I was fascinated to later learn that Graham saw Lady Macbeth qualities in her character that led her to re-read Macbeth, as well as Othello for her qualities as a first-class schemer. Elmer Berstien contributes an impressively panicked score (only his third at the time), but what impressed me most was Miller's construction of the Bunker Hill finale. Though this locale has been used so memorably in a score of great film noirs, including personal favourites Kiss Me Deadly, Cry Danger and Act of Violence, Miller's chase sequence has a brio and dangerous, Kathryn Bigelow-esque intensity that anticipates her own superb foot chase in Point Break. Commenting on the absurd, cruel irony that ends this same sequence, the critic Geninne Basinger points out that "nowhere is the foobar of two women turning up in similar dresses more of a fashion crisis than Sudden Fear."
Joan Crawford featuring a Gun and a Guy who Done-Wronged Her...Can't go wrong with that!
The last 20min of the film is superb!
I would love it if Joan Crawford shot me
Wonderful, wonderful film that builds a lot of suspense from point-of-view. Interesting Third Man-esque chase at the end which was great because it was not what I was expecting. Palance gives a great, quirky performance but this is really about Crawford. I feel this is the best performance I have seen from her. So raw and emotional; very vulnerable but strong-willed in the face of danger and despair. She did not all of a sudden become a mastermind just because this was a movie. She was totally human throughout. The change of her facial expression at the end while walking away from the accident at the end was perfect.
Includes Kitty Cameo.
A fabulous thriller starring Joan Crawford as a wealthy playwright who learns that her actor husband (Jack Palance) and his lover (Gloria Grahame) are plotting to kill her. What makes this an unusual film for its time is that Crawford learns of this scheme early on, and, after being terrified only briefly, decides to turn the tables on these motherfuckers and destroy them before they destroy her. The suspense really kicks in when her plan does not go as she expected. It's kind of a pioneering film, decades before Ripley decided that, no, the Alien was NOT going to get her, showing that women can take matters into their own hands and they do not have to be cowering in the corner while their husbands try to kill them. I would credit this to Crawford's influence as executive producer and the female screenwriter she hired, Lenore J. Coffee. Crawford is excellent here, as are Palance and Grahame, and the film is very stylish and suspenseful, and obviously influential to many similar thrillers that came later.
When a dictaphone is shown in the home office of a writer with such elaborate demonstration, you know it’s going be a key plot device later in the film. And that’s the thing with Sudden Fear. It’s not so much boilerplate woman-in-distress noir, as it is rather conventional and obvious. Leave it to star Joan Crawford and an excellent Gloria Grahame and a slithery Jack Palance to give heft to this piece. And old San Francisco gets shown off in some glory as well, maybe not as primely as in a couple other notable SF noirs, but still pretty nice. I’ve always had some weird issue with Crawford, just the extremity of her visage. Those eyebrows! That mouth! Those eyes, almost always glaring. But she’s very good here as the semi-spinsterish successful playwright who foolishly falls for an actor she fired (Palance). Grahame on the other hand is pitch perfect as Palance’s floozy girlfriend, pretty and nasty. I guess that’s why there were movie stars. To elevate mediocre pictures to decent ones.
Quite brilliant noir thriller. Some of the most memorable camerawork in the genre, imo.
Two films in one, and both are great. The first half is a brooding but mostly light romance with both Crawford and Palance surprising me with the restraint in their performances. I fully bought into their romance. In the second half things turn, and the shift in tone carries over to the cinematography and performances, which get broader and creepier, but still very effective. Crawford did great with the role, selling her various changes in mood and resolve. The final sequence is a real treat.
Really well-paced with great camerawork and compelling performances all around. Clever plotting that holds your attention until the totally bonkers ending. Crawford is surprisingly vulnerable.
Very slow, and plodding thriller from the early 1950's starring Joan Crawford and Jack Palance. Crawford was still very beautiful in her 40's, and had a powerful presence on screen. Jack Palance was no slouch either on the big screen. However both talents deserved better than the material offered up in SUDDEN FEAR, despite their respective Oscar nominations Based on the novel by Edna Sherry, and directed by David Miller, SUDDEN FEAR tells the story of Myra Hudson, a wealthy heiress/successful playwright who marries Lester Blaine, the handsome actor she had previously fired from her hit play. Yet their fairytale romance is not what it seems, for Lester Blaine has a hidden agenda: his wife's money. Worse, it turns out that the true love of Lester's life is not Myra Hudson, but one Irene Neves (Gloria Grahame). In fact, Lester plots with Irene to kill Myra, and take all of her money. Will Myra be able to foil the crooks' plans, and save her life? Despite the talent involved, SUDDEN FEAR is a mostly dull, by-the-numbers thriller whose approach to suspense is through broad, predictable and highly derivative brushstrokes. Joan Crawford is wonderful, yet her Myra Hudson character makes contrived, foolish choices that only seem to purposely place her in danger. Jack Palance and Gloria Grahame are fine thespians, yet their respective characters were written as foolish nincompoops incapable of accomplishing anything. Been wanting to see SUDDEN FEAR for many years, so I was glad to see the movie regardless of its own merit. That said, having now seen SUDDEN FEAR, I can only be glad that everyone involved in the film moved on to better things...
Sudden Fear has a very apt title, because what happens is sudden, and it indeed induces fear. The stakes in this movie change very quickly, executed through an overly convenient plot device (one of a few too many in the film) that might make you go, "oh, COME on", but none of that derails this under-appreciated thriller. Almost every choice made after that big turn is extremely cinematic and satisfying; the back half is full of secret plans, double crosses, and moral vindication. The Oscar-nominated cinematography displays some incredible visual storytelling, and reminded me of Conrad Hall's gauzy black-and-white style from The Outer Limits. (Not composer Elmer Bernstein's finest work, though.) Crawford gives a typically dynamic performance (this is the definition of a star vehicle), and Palance excels at his task to be imposing and ambiguous, as his character requires the audience to project many things onto him. The movie also contained this outdated line, which turned me into an 11-year-old for a second: "I'm going to San Francisco tomorrow."    "Oh, that sounds very gay." "Doesn't it?"
A satisfying and, at times, genuinely thrilling piece of noir. Joan Crawford, save a few moments of facial overacting, gives a solid performance as a woman who might not have married the man of her dreams after all. Jack Palance gives an adequate performance as do the rest of the supporting players. Surprisingly well done.
rewatched this with my mom and now she demands more Joan Crawford films.
First half is a bit slow. Crawford often plays "tough dames", but her character here is believably sympathetic and likable. The second half is practically non-stop suspense that builds and builds with many great moments and set pieces. Really unexpectedly great.
At first, I thought this picture might not live up to my expectations. But then Gloria Grahame showed up. Sudden Fear has a lot more going for it, though--like excellent use of San Francisco locations and a memorably oily Jack Palance. Most of all, this might be Crawford's best screen performance. While Daisy Kenyon & Johnny Guitar are stronger films overall, this flick makes the best use of Crawford's talents.
Got to see this when TCM played it for the first time a few nights ago. It's a satisfying Noir with all the right twists and turns. Gloria Grahame shines as the scheming girlfriend.
During the Broadway rehearsal of her new play, author Myra Hudson (Joan Crawford) decides leading actor Lester Blaine (Jack Palance) has to go, he just doesn't have the sort of face that would make her leading female character fall in love. After the show opens, she runs into Blaine on the train home to California and is soon eating her words as she is deeply in love by the time they arrive in San Francisco. They are soon married and Blaine reunites with an old partner Irene Neves (Gloria Grahame), a woman he used to work with in some sort of shady deals. They decide they could work together once again and if they are lucky hit it big, this time the target would be the very wealthy Myra. Their only problem is that Myra turns out to be much more resourceful than they figured. The story of a woman who is being driven mad by, or a potential murder victim of her husband is a noir staple that has drawn fine work from may actors, including Bergman, Fontaine, and Stanwyck, perhaps they view it as a commentary on the difficulty of a successful Hollywood marriage. But what makes Crawford's version of this familiar story so fascinating is that her actions seem so outlandish, so unexpected, that it is almost as if she is writing the story as she goes along or acting in one of her own plays. This feeling of unreality is hightened by Crawford's often stylized performance, for long stretches it is only her on the screen as she uses her face and body to express whatever emotion she is feeling, usually one of shock, fear, or intense concentration as she puts her convoluted plan into action. Director David Miller shows a fine understanding of noir conventions, particularly with his use of camera placement and fine black and white cinematography. The rest of the cast is also excellent, in only his third film the young Jack Palance more than holds up his end as Blaine who is a psychopath, and as Blaine who proves he would have been a fine choice as the romantic lead in Myra's play (and saved her a lot of trouble), while Gloria Gahame is, of course, unbeatable in her patented Gloria Grahme part. The new Blu-ray from the Cohen Film Collection looks good.
I hope there were no wire hangers in that closet
A very entertaining noir with a great lead performance from Joan Crawford.
"I was just wondering what I had done to deserve you" Very tense little thriller. Can I just watch Joan Crawford hide in a closet for another half hour?
Noirvember 2016. This was a fun one. Great use of shadows and Joan Crawford, Jack Palance and Gloria Grahame were all terrific.
Joan Crawford is queen and will forever own my ass. This film is stressful--but in a good way. It will keep you on the edge of your seat. One of Joan's best!
miniscule plotholes aside, Sudden Fear was a good, enjoyable, suspenseful film noir with few of its scenes memorable and outstanding — the lights flickering across the antagonist's face while driving, Myra Hudson walking back at the end with ambivalence shown on her face and the antagonist's face after getting off the car, readying for that chase enough to induce nervousness and anxiety. with a simple plot stirred along by a number of opposite schemes, being married to someone has never been this frightening. and let us not forget Joan Crawford saying the words "I feel so gay." in one scene. consider this a 45 out of 100 in the Gone Girl scale.
PLEASE BE ADVISED: No matter how well you think you have researched your murder plan, SHIT WILL GO WRONG.
Perfectly ridiculous in the way that only Hollywood melodramas of the studio system could be. Leads are all ideally cast and the whole thing is very well-shot and paced. The scene when Joan brings out that (beautifully) hand-written schedule of her evening of espionage ("11:00 - I leave my house") is the stuff camp legends are made of.
Joan Crawford excels as a rich but emotionally vulnerable playwright who needs rewrite, quickly, when she learns that her new husband, an actor played by Jack Palance (her in-character assessment of his abilities is right on the money) and his clandestine squeeze Gloria Grahame (as always faultless) plan to kill her. Crawford's skill as a silent movie performer comes into play here; by the second half, she has very little dialogue as the tension mounts. Skillfully directed on San Francisco locations by David Miller, who, with an assist from composer Elmer Bernstein, sticks the landing. The Cohen Media Group restoration of the film is currently on the repertory circuit.
A full-fledged star vehicle for Ms. Crawford, in this film-noir tale, she plays Myra Hudson, a rich Broadway playwright-spinster, who intuitively vetoes an actor Lester Blaine's (Palance) audition for her newest play, since his unusual look doesn’t seem to be well qualified for a romantic role, which prompts Lester’s chagrin and he rebukes that Myra is wrong for her impetuous decision. Some days later, on the train back to her home in San Francisco after the play turns out to be a hit, Myra encounters Lester, out of courtesy and to manifest there is no hard feelings, they bury the hatchet and Lester proves to her that he in fact is a virtuoso romantic suitor for her despite the age difference, and she is significantly besotted, the two tie the knot afterwards, which erects a perfect hotbed for the ensuing murder plan. There is an ulterior motive in Lester’s agenda from his very first move, when his old flame, a sensual siren Irene Neves (Grahame) arrives uninvited, the two scheme together to murder Myra after knowing that the latter will donate the bulk of her fortune to a foundation. But Ms. Crawford will not resign herself to an unwitting wife who is like a lamb to slaughter, right in the midway, Myra receives a rude awakening and unearths Lester’s sinister plan, after the initial shock and distress (which inconveniently outstays its welcome as Ms. Crawford’s one-woman show), and a clumsy act which accidentally destroys the key testimony, she straightens up and dauntlessly decides to preempt their action in her own way. Here, the movie starts to glisten with suspense, under the ominous chiaroscuro lighting, particularly designated in her favour, Ms. Crawford’s dignified mien glints intensely from resolution, hesitation, worry to utter fear, and everything is on tenterhooks, viewers vicariously experience the struggle, strain and danger from Myra’s viewpoint, playing meek and unsuspecting in front of her double-faced husband on a daily basis, cautiously plotting her counter-move in the sly step by step, while keeping hold of her usual pretence without arousing any suspicion, she must be a natural actress herself to fake a glamorous fall from staircases without any damage done to undercut her mobility, also a first-rate penmanship-imitator, and practising her first-ever plan of murder in her mind, which is a dead giveaway that things will not proceed exactly in the way as she has envisaged. The biggest question is, is she as good killer as an actress? Is she capable of pulling the trigger when the crunch arrives? The script mercifully (or rather cowardly) saves Myra from being the ultimate executioner of poetic justice, lest it would blemish Crawford’s iconic benevolent image, she is never a noir heroine, and here, she is ever so close to be one, an Oscar nomination is quite rewarding, it is the only time, she and her arch-enemy, Ms. Bette Davis (in Stuart Heisler's THE STAR 1952) are competing in the same category, although both are the charming also-rans in this case. An angular, hatched-faced Jack Palance is an unorthodox leading man in his career breakthrough role, who has no qualm in oozing venom while being hospitable and deferential. Yet, he is routinely degraded with a BEST SUPPORTING ACTOR Oscar nomination, high-fives with his fellow nominee Richard Burton in Henry Koster’s MY COUSIN RACHEL (1952), an Olivia de Havilland’s vehicle, two glaring examples of Academy’s category injustice for budding leading actors. One of the strong points of this David Miller’s thriller is the cinematography from Charles Lang, greatly taps into the forbidding nighttime of San Francisco, e.g. the final chasing sequences in the steep streets, sufficiently surpasses the ongoing action itself. Finally, a friendly advice to all female viewers, sometimes, you have to stick to your instinct of the first impression, simply because it is a life-saving bonanza bequeathed by nature itself, don’t easily throw it away.
A slick little thriller from 1952 that showcases Joan Crawford's ability to carry a movie. She starred in a lot of high-quality stuff (like "Mildred Pierce" for example) that any actress would have shined in, but it's when she landed in more middle-of-the-road material that she was able to illustrate her star wattage, because not just any old actress could take a movie like "Sudden Fear" and make something memorable out of it. In this one, Crawford is a playwright and reluctant heiress who decides the actor chosen for the lead in her new drama (Jack Palance, darkly but disturbingly handsome) isn't right after all and has him booted. He meets up with her a few months later and lets her know there are no hard feelings. Indeed, not only aren't there any hard feelings, but the two end up getting married after a whirlwind romance. Only after they're married do we find out that Palance is unsurprisingly a creep and that he and his jilted ex-wife (or current wife, I'm foggy on that point), played with bad-girl relish by Gloria Grahame, have designs on getting their hands on Crawford's dough. Let the plotting begin. The twist in this one is that Crawford finds out about their plan without them knowing, and proves herself to be a sharp cookie in hatching a counter plot to save her skin. It's quite refreshing to see her take matters into her own hands rather than simper and quail waiting for someone else to save her. The ending, a chase through the dark streets of San Francisco, is a bit of a mess, but by then you've had so much fun with the movie and Crawford has won you over with her ballsiness that you don't much care. Crawford received her third and final Academy Award nomination for her performance, and Jack Palance was nominated in the supporting category as well. Perennial Oscar nominee Charles Lang won his 9th of an eventual 18 career nominations for using shadows to make the most out of San Francisco's murky streets and Jack Palance's razor sharp cheekbones. And Sheila O'Brien landed the last of the film's quartet of nominations for designing Crawford's elegant black and white gowns. "Sudden Fear" is a treat for film noir lovers, Joan Crawford lovers, San Francisco lovers, suspense thriller lovers, or anyone who just loves a good old fashioned entertaining movie. Grade: A-
Very suspenseful noir, the edge-of-your-seat kind, I almost couldn't stand the tension. Crawford is excellent, particularly in the scene where she sees herself in the mirror with the gun and breaks down. The sequence with the time schedule and Crawford's eyes and the envisioned string of events is really well done, as is the thrilling finale, where Charles Lang's beautiful photography and Elmer Bernstein's exciting score are perfectly in sync. Also, great performance by Jack Palance, and let's not forget the wonderful Gloria Grahame, always a pleasure!
After rejecting an actor for her new play because he doesn't look like a typical romantic leading man, the playwright marries the actor and slowly starts to believe he may be planning to murder her. It's a typical noir plot, but the film is surprisingly good. When I first saw this years ago, I thought it was pretty awful, but I have no idea why. The film is fairly solid with solid performances all around. That is, save for Gloria Grahame whose performance as Jack Palance's devious girlfriend is pretty hysterically bad. It's like she's trying to be a teenage Mae West or something, but it doesn't translate very well to the camera. But Palance and Joan Crawford are both solid and play really well off one another. Crawford's contained hysteria is much better here than it is in films like "Possessed" but not quite as good as her later psychobiddy brilliance. She vogues her way through the shadows which are, admittedly, really well-done. The cinematography is solid and evocative. And Palance with his incredibly angular face is really menacing and crafts a distinctive noir villain out of, on paper, a really boring baddie. "Sudden Fear" is good. It's not incredible by any means, but it's got a pair of excellent stars doing some of their best work.
I am not entirely sure why I was slow to watch Joan Crawford movies. Better yet, I'm not sure why I cannot recall her in the ones that I had seen before becoming enraptured by her performance in What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?. Watching her final Oscar-nominated performance, I am left understanding why that is. In the battle of Crawford vs. Bette Davis, I side more with the latter. Both were supposedly the bad girls of classic Hollywood, but I cannot entirely buy into what Crawford does in Sudden Fear. The film isn't bad by any stretch. It's a solid take on film noir with a lot of great transparent imagery. In fact, the art design for this film is the highlight of the entire production. You buy into the tension because of how the camera moves around the set and presents fantastical imagery for you to buy into Crawford's lunacy. The issue is that the story itself is almost too simple for its own good. Crawford hears that Jack Palance wants to kill her, and spends the rest of the movie panicking about it. The third act has its moments, but this is more of a point to see Crawford do that campy shtick in a melodrama. She sells it, but I felt like there had to be something else to sell the film. It could be that the film was initially a bit of a slog transitioning to the California sequences. We see that she is a playwright. That's perfectly fine. However, it never serves a point to the back half of the story - and that's a little disappointing. I get that she needs an excuse for a state-of-the-art Dictaphone, but that can't be it. I think that if she used her theater skills to save the day, maybe the film would've redeemed itself with a few more points. Otherwise, it's a tad disjointed once you get the initial set-up out of the way. I don't know if this is an irrational complaint, but it's one that made me want some theatricality to enter stage left. I want to like Crawford more than I actually do. She definitely has a presence that makes you notice her. She has charisma that makes her both nice and intimidating. However, I don't think this film does anything to make me enraptured by her as an icon. Maybe it's just the old curse of actresses getting Oscar nominations for their lesser roles, but there has to be something I'm missing that The Academy clearly loves. I'll keep watching her movies, but I hope that she's allowed to do more than compensate for a lackluster story with campy screams.
After a successful playwright rejects an actor for not being a convincing romantic lead, she meets up with him and he romances her then marries her to prove her wrong. But something more sinister is afoot. Joan Crawford and Jack Palance both give excellent performances in what's otherwise a rather contrived thriller of the "my husband might be trying to kill me"/woman in distress sub-genre. The third act is quite good but the rest of the film feels rather overlong and dragging. But Palance and Crawford manages to mostly keep your attention.
Myra Hudson: Remember what Nietzsche says "Live dangerously!" Lester Blaine: You know what happened to Nietzsche? Myra Hudson: No, what? Lester Blaine: He's dead.
Wow my first time seeing this film and I loved it! Amazing directing and cast especially Joan Crawford and Jack Palance
Why You Get to Know People Before You Marry Them I suppose it does happen sometimes. Some people meet and just know. There are some people who know each other for hours or days, marry, and stay madly in love for the rest of their lives. I'm hesitant about it, though. I think you're much more likely to divorce if you don't get to know the person you're marrying. This may be in part because I've seen so many movies like this one, but on the other hand, how many romantic comedies and action movies are there where the two people are clearly destined to end up together despite having known each other for hours or days? So I guess how Hollywood takes the whole thing and looks at it as "how this is going to go depends on what genre you're in." I guess it is, at that, the other way 'round--how it goes influences what genre you're going to end up in. In the real world, you are frequently going to end up in a drama. And, yes, sometimes, it goes badly enough so that you can end up in a film noir like this one. Hopefully a little less ludicrous and histrionic, though. Myra Hudson (Joan Crawford) is an heiress who is also a successful Broadway playwright. One day, she is at a rehearsal for her upcoming play, which is to star Lester Baine (Jack Palance). Only she watches a rehearsal and decides that he's wrong for the role. Indeed, this is actually because she thinks he's freaky-looking and not someone that a lovely young woman would be obsessed with. He lectures her on the actual appearance of Casanova and storms off. A month later, they are on the same train west together. They talk, and she becomes captivated by him. Unbeknownst to her, he even buys a ticket to San Francisco to keep talking; he was originally supposed to get off the train in Chicago. After a rapid courtship, they marry. Her lawyer suggests a clause in her will that he only inherit if he doesn't remarry; she rejects the idea. However, Lester sees the will before she has it altered. His conversation with his ex-girlfriend, Iris Neves (Gloria Grahame), about it is caught on Myra's Dictaphone. Myra overhears the recording, which basically implies that she shouldn't start any long books. So okay, Joan Crawford was fourteen years older than Jack Palance. He was only four years older than Gloria Grahame. And, frankly, she looked like Joan Crawford and Gloria Grahame looked like Gloria Grahame. All this is true. On the other hand, he looked like Jack Palance. This also feels like another one of those movies where they're relying on our being aware that she's Joan Crawford instead of actually putting in character development. She talks repeatedly about how happy Lester makes her, but does she ever do anything else? She oversees a rehearsal and gets Lester fired, and that's practically all we see her do. We know that Lester marries Myra for her money, but we never see enough to believe much of anything else, or to know why she would believe much of anything else. That latter is considerably more important, because the revelation about how he really feels should come as a shock and doesn't. The scene with Myra's elaborate plan in response to Lester's overheard conversation with Iris is the best-made part of the movie and pushes this just barely into recommended territory, but only just barely. It would be higher except for how even that sequence contains a few things that are just ridiculous. Like the idea that Myra wrote down a timetable for herself, apparently so that we could see her planned actions with that part of the timetable superimposed over it. I suppose it's to make us aware that it's how she's imagining things will go, but that didn't work for me. Not "I didn't like it"; I mean it didn't work. I didn't realize until at least halfway through that we weren't watching events as they play out. Maybe it would have if I hadn't seen such things played seriously in other films; I don't know. It's a shame, though, because the sequence including the planning and the actual execution is extremely well done other than that and one or two other details. Like the fact that I assuredly do not believe Joan Crawford deserved an Oscar nomination for it, though the field was so dismal that it makes me want to go look up what else was released in 1952. (Now that I have looked it up? Maureen O'Hara. That is all.) I suppose it also bothers me that those fourteen years are as big a deal as they are. If, in 1964, a version of the movie had been made with Jack Palance as the writer and Shirley MacLaine as a young actress conspiring along with Jon Voight, would you find that believable? I mean, yes, Jack Palance is creepy-looking, but that actually got less true as he aged into his face, so never mind that part of it. We're a lot more okay with Jack Palance as a romantic match for Shirley MacLaine than we are with Joan Crawford as a romantic match for Jack Palance. Heck, we're not always okay with Shirley MacLaine and Jon Voight, and I looked it up. He's four years younger than she is. (Actually, I went looking specifically for someone four years younger than her. Would you have preferred Peter Yarrow? Which would have been unbelievable for other reasons.) Yes, the point is made at the beginning that he isn't the most handsome guy in the world, which is vital in some ways to how entrapped she becomes by him, but that doesn't make her a washed-up old hag, either.
Great performance from Joan Crawford in this solid and beautifully shot film noir. Joan is ably supported by Jack Palance and Gloria Grahame as the husband and mistress who want to kill her. The film has a very thrilling end sequence filmed in the streets of San Francisco.
A little bit of Joan Crawford goes a long way for me but this is nonetheless a very effective thriller. flickersintime.com/1952/sudden-fear-1952/
Joan Crawford received her third Best Actress Academy Award Nomination for this well-made vehicle, while co-star Jack Palance was nominated for Best Supporting Actor. Rich, mature Crawford marries the young and charming, if rather unattractive, Palance. Accidentally, she learns that her seemingly loving husband and his lover (Gloria Graham) are plotting to murder her. After a night filled with shock and fear, she plots revenge. An impressive scene showcases Crawford’s ability to wordlessly express these raging emotions. Another in a fine series of films Crawford made in the decade (1945-1954) after departing MGM and going to Warner Bros.
Joan Crawford received her third Best Actress Academy Award Nomination for this carefully tailored vehicle. A rich, mature playwright marries a charming younger man. Accidentally, she learns that her seemingly loving husband has a mistress, and they are scheming to murder her. After initial shock and fear, she plots revenge. This scenario allows Crawford to express her emotions,loving, shocked, fearful, angry, vengeful, with a range of impressive facial expressions. In one tense scene, she is trapped in a closet as her murderous husband prowls the room. Only a small strip of her face is lighted as she peers out, clutching a scarf to still her breathing. Her large eyes mutely express her terror. Jack Palance and Gloria Graham are quite effective as the murderous plotters. Palance was nominated for a Best Supporting Actor AA.
Excellent film noir, Joan doing her best as always, great quality thriller👍.
Joan Crawford has a deep chocolatey mousse of qualities. A fierce strength of character and intelligence, a woman making this man's world look a half-life; but a strata of weakness buried where only love can frak it. Weakness borne of pride. This movie and Mildred Pierce exploit these qualities to the fore, the way a romantic comedy three-dimensionalises Cary Grant. These are the only two of her films, that I have seen (and I'm disqualifying the bizarre Baby Jane), so I'll start to rectify this fault with "Humoresque" (Garfield!). This is a brutally written piece; so much plot in the first half. Crawford and Jack Palance fit this material perfectly; an incendiary pairing. The match is Gloria Grahame! Crawford screams melodrama so you beg for her to be hurt. You want to see the torture writ exponential across her face. Pain galvanises her. The weight of betrayal makes her stand taller. Some people like to watch the world burn; some need the flames to become their real selves. Subtle mystery wouldn't suit this Phoenix. A racing plotline, that delivers the punches in blurring combinations is her tempo. How many leading men could match this force. The young Palance has this physical density. When Crawford casually dismisses him for not meeting her ideal for a romantic lead; he dismissed her as casually. When they next meet, accidentally (?), you wonder how much of that rejection is playing on his mind. In fact, Palance acts as though evil is banging down the doors of his purported innocence. Whilst he remains too good to be true, he seems so very, very good. There weren't enough movies made of this dark velvet to allow Palance to be the star he deserved to be. Like Swanson said, the movies got smaller. Shakespeare wasn't around to write noir.
If "Bette Davis Eyes" is a four-minute pop song from the '80s, then "Joan Crawford Eyes" is a totally uncompromising Captain Beefheart song with a weird time signature that still manages to completely rock. And "Gloria Grahame Eyes" is a Prince song.
It’s only right that Sudden Fear’s twist-laden and suspense-filled plot would unravel on the zigzagging streets of San Francisco’s Russian Hill district. That neighborhood’s many narrow-winding paths, along with its famous crooked Lombard Street, serve as the perfect backdrop for this noir fashioned story of love, betrayal, and murder.
Featuring an over the top melodramatic performance from Joan Crawford, this is nevertheless a great story with a fantastic climax.
If you can accept the premise of Joan Crawford as a very successful and rich playwright and Jack Palance as a romantic lead, then you should be able to enjoy this twisty but somewhat ludicrous femme jep movie from the early 50’s. Joan who was 47 at the time and approaching her gorgon period plays as I said a hot playwright who is also an heiress with a large home in San Francisco where most of the movie takes place. The film opens with a rehearsal of her new play in New York, with Jack Palance playing the lead. Joan has qualms about him not being romantic enough (read handsome) to play the part and has him fired. So of course on the cross country train ride that Joan is taking back home to San Francisco after the play opens to smash reviews, who should also be on the train but none other than Jack. Joan is all so sorry for firing him, and before you know it they’re playing poker and having breakfast as the train speeds on to the city by the bay. Well Joan of course falls madly in love with Jack and soon they’re in montages taking in the sights, and dining and dancing in all the hot spots. And then they get married and its darling this and darling that until Joan discovers by accident a devious plot Jack is hatching with his old girlfriend played with hellish relish by Gloria Grahame, all blonde and bad. Joan who has had many moments of over the top acting in her career really soars in this one and I swear at one point I thought her eyes were going to pop out of her head. Palance who excelled at playing villains throughout his long career simply gives away the show by being well Jack Palance. What with his unattractive face that looks like a cubist portrait with mud thrown on it, or a bruised boxer’s mug, and in fact one of his famous roles was as the battered fighter in “Requiem For A Heavyweight” that he did on Playhouse 90 in 1956 andh e does have a down and dirty animal magnetism that works well in his scenes with Grahame (kiss me, kiss me hard she moans to Palance). The film is a bit slow and tedious in parts, because there’s so much plot but the last hour is good and goosy with a beautifully done if improbable ending. Smoothly directed by David Miller who began his career directing sports shorts like “Table Tennis”, “Hurling,” “Racing Canines”, and “Aquatic Artistry” and went on to direct feature films most notably “Lonely Are The Brave” in 1962. With a good thumping score by Elmer Bernstein, and cinematography by the great Charles Lang who received an Oscar nomination for his work. Also Oscar nominations for costume, Actress and supporting actor. Surprisingly considering that this is a Kino release both the sound and the transfer leave much to be desired.
Great film noir/thriller with clever story and strong performances and direction.
50's Joan Crawford is my favorite Joan Crawford. Jack Palance was the perfect creepyhot villain, and Gloria Grahame is just awesome at all times.
Sorry, Joan Crawford's eyebrows still scare me.
I prefer Aldrich's similarly themed Crawford-in-trouble Autumn Leaves. It is soap turned noir whereas this is more noir turned soap.
Myra (played Joan Crawford), a playwright decides that Lester (played by Jack Palance) shouldn't star in her latest play, to his displeasure. They later meet on a train travelling across America and after a whirlwind romance marry. All is not rosy however - Myra is a rich woman, Jack is a man with a girlfriend who'd like to get his hands on her money, and he's in a hurry so it will have to by foul means rather than fair. f you can raise yourself above the level of spotting things that people wouldn't have done in the situations they find themselves in this film, this isn't a bad film noir.
Absolutely brilliant, a masterclass in suspense. This is how you do it, Kathryn Bigelow.
[Gloria Grahame, Joan Crawford] I sort of liked the beginning when it was sort of a love story. Once it turned into the 'thriller', I lost almost all interest. I usually always love Gloria Grahame, but she was just a shrill obnoxious character. This might be the first thing I've seen Crawford in. She was fine in those early parts, but when she was forced to mug with a horrified or scared look on her face, she became uninteresting. Jack Palance is kind of like a lesser version of Christopher Walkens. He can never be lost in a role, but his presence is always interesting.
Crawford gives it her all. The plot took a long time to get going, and while it got much more suspenseful as it went along and the latter part of the film contained some good ideas, it didn't entirely satisfy me on the whole.
This film is a noir/thriller ? I have a hard time telling the difference sometime, but going by the way it is shot, I would say it is an Noir all the way. In fact it is one of the most brilliantly shot films I have seen. I can't quite say the same for the plot which is a lot of fun to watch unravel, but it is one of those that have you constantly asking yourself why didn't she just do this or that? Joan Crawford is quite good in this and so is Jack Palance, and Gloria Grahme is always good.
