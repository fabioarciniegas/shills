It’s pretty neat and innovative so go figure.
Saw this film on Thanksgiving, and I am thankful for it. I believe every movie from a foreign country should show you what that country's electrical outlets look like, and this movie fulfills that desire.
I went into Border not knowing a single thing about it. I feel that is the best way to experience this film. Border is a wonderful, if a bit disturbing, love story. It’s quite the unique love story because it is also part Dark fantasy. This film is beautiful looking, the fantastic lighting and lovely scenery makes it feel wild and free, implying that our main character, Tina, wants to be. The performances are incredible, especially from the lead Eva Melander. She able to show a wide range of emotions through the makeup she is encased in. The makeup is also fantastic, I thought that they really looked like that in real life, but then I realized how hard it would’ve been to find two actors who look like this and can act well. This definitely needs an Oscar for makeup. My only problems with the flick is the editing, the film editing is quite jarring with its quick cuts. And the whole film is hand cammed as well, and its purpose is clear in some scenes but not in others. Border is beautifully dark with a B-Plot that ties in fantastically in the end.
When I saw the trailer I thought, "this looks super weird, I'm so ready for this!" I wasn't ready for this.
Yo what the fuck? This sure is something different, and I prefer the more out there, ambitous and just flat out weird stuff to the generic multimillion dollar studio movies, so it gets point for being... Unique. This is a strange mix of nordic noir, fantasy, romance, and some comedy if you look at it the right way. Sometimes these things all combine to make something great, more often the tones clash and makes the entire thing not all too coherent. The makeup work is great. When I saw the trailer I thought they must have found some weird looking people with slightly disfigured faces who also also turned out to be actors. But no, the main chacaters are some fairly well know and respected scandinavian actors with a ton of great makeup work. It never feels fake, you believe it for the most part. For the most part because, for 2 scenes, things get reaaaally wacky. At one point what we assumed to be a guy-troll gives birth to some creatuee only slightly less disgusting than the baby from Eraserhead. Okay that was a weird but sort of intriguing twist. Then we get maybe the weirdest sex scene ever? The girl-troll just... Grows a dick. Much to her own horror I might add. It looks fucking weird and goofy and disgusting and kinda takes you out of it. Ultimately I am still not sure if I liked these scenes of if they are "good", but they sure are interesting and will stay with me for a while so thered that. Most scenes, in themselves, were enjoyable. Some even worked great together, mostly the (family) drama stuff. But when it trier to bring together the thriller and romance plots things get a bit too much and it ultimately derails the whole film. We are left with a film that doesnt have a whole lot to say but was a fun ride to be on for the most part. If "weird" is something you like in films and are interested in independent small films thst are more slow character dramas, sure check this out if you can. If anything else, you won't miss anything if you skip this one. Except for some of the best makeup work ever?
Certain elements of the plot mesh a bit awkwardly, but this is still one hell of a strange time at the movies. To even disclose precisely what genre it is would be a spoiler.....so I’ll say no more.

There were moments of this movie that felt truly liberating. Oh, and Eva Melander is nothing short of groundbreaking with her extremely physical and feral, yet also restrained performance.
acting is great, the world is cool, a few good scenes but the plot is kind of a wreck, and doesn’t add up to much. i don’t think the characters were used to their full potential.
I’ve been excited about this movie for a while because it was written by the guy who wrote Let The Right One In, a movie I absolutely loved when I was a junior in high school, but Border is basically the same movie but not as good? Structurally this is the same as it anyway, most of this movie is a standard “ugly people have feelings too” kind of movie, but it feels more genuine than your average Hollywood take on this. I just felt like I was watching something that I had already seen. The third act becomes a thriller, and I wish that was the entire movie because it felt like something new, something I hadn’t seen before. So much of this movie just feels like Let The Right One In, but without vampires. Once the first twist in the film is unraveled, it definitely picks up and has some interesting elements. Ending kinda sucks though, so there’s probably a solid half an hour I really like in here, everything else just felt derivative. Gotta give props to this movie for how weird it gets, and holy shit some of effects (excluding the CGI moose) looked really great and saying what they are would spoil it.  Overall pretty disappointed with this film even though it has a lot of amazing elements to it, but so much of it feels dry and created already. It’s nowhere near a bad movie, just disappointing if you are a fan of Let The Right One In and wanted the writer to go in a new direction.
Enjoyed the oddness and magical realism, but not quite sure I understood the thesis.  IFC Center
An incomparable experience, for worse or for better.
I'm just here for the growly troll sex.
An enchanting dark fairy tale. Reminds me of upstream color or under the skin, portraying a world both magical and completely recognizable. A thoughtful, challenging, and mood inducing film.
The movie has two plots: the one that's described about a customs officer that can smell emotions and whose life is thrown when she meets a strange drifter. And a less talked about subplot about an investigation of a paedophilia ring. At first it's a strangely beautiful love story and a late blooming coming of age tale that's one of the most unique films I've seen. Then it decides to marry the two plots and in the process loses sympathy for pretty much every character and doesn't resolve the only plot point I'm interested in at that point. 2/3rds of a great film let down by a messy ending.
Refreshing. Although i pegged it early and often still it was truly fun to watch unfold. Ps. After reading other reviews i see part of enjoying it more was being more aware of the mythology but i dont think is necessary, just dont try to read it as an american "ugly but beautiful inside" thing
A tough film to review. Unpleasant and unsettling, though unquestionably skillfully made and even touching at times. But I think delving so deeply and minutely into the mythology of this world is a mistake. By doing so, the underlying metaphor for the alienation, abuse and exploitation of the ‘other’ in society (whether based on class or race or religion or nationality or sex or orientation) is lost in revelations of more and more weirdness. When an audience is challenged not to look away, sometimes they will - or wish they had - and resent being forced to choose.
Excellent acting propels a deeply interesting story; the makeup is icing on the cake, with some daring do in the form of closeups and scenes where the actors submerge themselves.
One of the weirder movies I've seen this year. It's almost like a live action gritty fairy tale.
The feel-weird — REALLY weird — love story of the year. Or it could have been had it explored the sweetness rather than simply exploiting its oddities. It’s like a superficial spin on the ideas of alienation, isolation and temptation found in “Let the Right One In” and a halfhearted parable about gender fluidity rolled together — with an utterly distasteful thriller turn that is pointless until, well, it isn’t. For a movie so gentle as far as physical violence goes, there is something aggressively offputting here, which could have worked if only it weren’t so emotionally removed.
Going into a movie blindly is lost art nowadays. We've become handicapped from a pure experience by the endless stream of trailers and sneak peeks. If you were ever to stay away from those crutches, it should be with this film, where the old adage rings true, the less you know, the better. Border is a really good film. It, at least, has all the cliche parts of a really good film. Good cinematography, direction, writing, editing are all present here. But there was one thing that kept me from writing about this film for so long. It took me the better part of a month to realize how damn original Border is. At this point, the pretentious in you is yelling "Nothing is original!". And maybe in themes, no, it is not original. But there is something about an immersion that is hard for movies to achieve. Yet, Border did that. Border sucks you into this world and forces you to sympathize with the characters. It forces you, in disbelief, to realize that maybe we aren't that different while still tackling the tough concepts of loneliness, angst, and understanding. Please don't watch the trailers. Please don't read the synopsis. Please go in there blind and let the movie consume you.
Quite thought-provoking. Visually beautiful. Engaging plot.
Didn’t completely love Border, but it’s unapologetically weird as hell and I respect that.
Glad to see the Geico cavemen get work. Really tho, this is bonkers!!
There is one clear message that Gräns communicates, and that is: humanity is a fucked up species. And we all know this to be a legitimate argument, so it's good to be reminded of it, as a member of the human race. However, there are multiple ways to show such a message, and here start my troubles with the film. I'll quickly rewind to get to my point... Gräns is one of the weirdest love stories I've ever seen, but it's cute, in its own twisted way. This is where its power lies in, in this alternative view of life and experience; so as a result we can reflect on our own existence. Unfortunately, towards the end, the audience is not trusted anymore to make its own judgement on these points. The film decides to depart from its nuances, and instead simply shows and tells what it was about all along.
NEON is slowly becoming my favorite studio. In their short life they've given us Colossal, Beach Rats, Ingrid goes west, I tonya, Border, Three Identical Strangers, Vox Lux and now this? A24 WHO? That being said I didn't lLOVE this. And I was sure I would. I think I expected more and idk what I was expecting tbh. But that doesn't mean this wasn't good. I love weird ass movies.. and this one deff is one of the weirdest I've seen this year. Fantastic performances from the two leads covered in make up and you still felt what they were feeling and going through. The best way I can describe this is an adult fantasy movie/ thriller/ drama man its so weird to describe this. Its a blend of many genres and it succeeds. It kept me at the edge of my seat and it just kept getting weirder and weirder. I really didn't know where it'd go. Despite me saying I didn't love it, I really enjoyed it and I appreciate them making these type of movies. Keep them coming NEON.
After now seeing the 6th entry into the Best Foreign Language Film category I pity anyone who has to judge and rank this year’s best entries. Originality, Novelty, and blended narratives feature highly in the entries I’ve seen this year, and maybe more than any is this amazing film from Sweden.  Without being pedantic with important themes in this film, Abbassi at once tackles tough issues facing  the disenfranchised, the marginalized,  even the “Me Too Movement”, and completely novel observations on gender.  There are a few elements of Swedish lore and nomenclature that might escape the audience, but this surprisingly different film with an incredibly capable  cast  clearly gets its point across
Halfway through this movie I looked around the almost empty theater at the 4 or 5 other people that were there and asked myself, "Why the fuck are you people here? Why did you decide to come see this movie?" I was absolutely sure only 1 or 2 would last to the end. I was (gladly?) wrong. Border is best seen as cold as possible. If you must, watch the trailer and learn nothing else about it. It's about equal parts outrageous as it is conventional, which I think helps keep itself from eschewing into art house territory (and depending on your opinion, this is either for better or for worse). I really, really hate buzzwords, but I also really, really don't want to give much away. That said, it's hard to put it into one solid genre (genre-defying!). It's heartfelt, it's thrilling, but I think what most viewers seem to resonate with is the humanity of the film that defines its through-line. That humanity helps ground the more outrageous parts, and the simple, high-concept plot is helps the film maintain momentum while still keeping the main character's relatability. It's well written. That's what I'm trying to say. I wouldn't call the filmmaking necessarily "exceptional." Aside from the (fantastic) performances, no single aspect of the cinematography, blocking, editing, or sound design really stood out (okay, there was one scene where the shot went out of focus during a single, but it fit the emotion of the scene kinda so lets ignore, cool thank you). I suppose this isn't a bad thing. The film was really only trying to tell its story through the performances of the cast, so I wouldn't consider it a bad thing. You could almost call it sublime. Almost. While writing this review I kept leaning back and forth between 3 stars (out of 4, fuck you letterboxd for not allowing custom scales) and a full four stars. Does this film really deserve 4 stars? I think it warrants a second viewing to decide. 3 out of 4 stars. Border is a great film, best experienced knowing next to nothing about it. While it probably doesn't make for a compelling review, I would highly recommend this movie. If you can see it in theaters before Oscar season, you probably should.
A wonderfully thoughtful picture with some dark ideas and some even darker observations on morality. The film appears to be a simple tale of a border patrol agent who happens to excel at sniffing people out. At the core of it, however, is a startling love story that takes some very unusual turns. The Swedish country side has never been more appropriately used, at least in recent years. It's by the same writer as Let the Right One In, so you can probably imagine that not everything will be cleanly wrapped up and or simply put. Films like this make me question myself about many things. Do any of us truly know what it means to be human? What kind of a tight rope do we walk? Is it the same kind of border for all of us? As entertaining as it is challenging. Films like Border are the reason why I love movies. A vibrant, yet mysterious, film.
I really wanted to watch sweet romance and not a movie about queer trolls that make child pornography but that’s John A Lindqvist 4 u I guess :(
It takes some real innovation to take a movie about a cop who smells crime and make it tonally and thematically confused. I was kind of on board until about halfway through, when it starts wielding heavy subject matter such as child abuse like a thematic cudgel in order to say...something about how humans are bad? I'd have been much kinder to it if it had something to say at the end, rather than building up in the direction of a theme that never pays off. It's a movie with all setup, disappointing payoff.
A very special body horror episode of Law and Order: SVU
Sometimes being truly original is all it takes, though that's not all this film has going for it. Really though, considering the vast library of great films from decades past, the only thing that really interests me about modern filmmaking is innovation. That's obviously a broad term though and is meant as such, so that anything from technical innovation to subject matter is included. This film doesn't have much innovation in the former, but all the more in the latter. It's really a delightfully strange film, its surreal central metaphor/allegory resisting (at least for most of the film) any easy mapping onto the real world political landscape, apart from some very vague idea of "the other", and is all the better for it. The concept is so hard to explain, making very little sense, but that's really the core of the enjoyment for a good while. And once that novelty wears off a bit, the film gets very explicit and sensually provocative in ways that are even more delightful than what has come before. Keeping us occupied while all of that slowly develops is a b-plot that, while not superlative in any way, definitely serves as good filler and interesting character work. If I had to find faults with the film, it would have to be that its central premise does start to get more tangible and closer to real world analogues towards the end. This dampens the surrealism a bit and also presumably makes the film a bit more vulnerable to accusations of taking ownership of certain material that it perhaps can't entirely handle. There's also a coldness to the film, related to its commitment to its premise, making this more of an intellectual exercise than an empathetic one. That would be perfectly fine if it wasn't for the fact that this intellectual part is a bit weakened by the previously mentioned motions towards a more decipherable allegory. Still, these are very tiny flaws to one of the best and most original films of the year for me so far.
Very nice modern fairytale! The less you know about this before you see it, the better. I also enjoyed the (sporadic) electronic ambient soundtrack very much!
I don’t think I’ll ever forget that troll penis.
A disturbing fairy tale with themes of belonging and animalistic nature. Well acted and leaves you with a bit to think about.
#9: 28 FANCINE Nope
Weird done right. A troll living among humans in Sweden encounters another troll who attempts to recruit her to the troll revolution. Touching and effective. Top film of the year for me.
The "MoviePass Films" logo was hilarious. Also: Long shot for Best Makeup Oscar?
I did *not* see that coming.
An interesting premise and idea that is executed with certain finesse but slightly uneven approach. Solidly acted but a bit of uniformity in the direction would have been better for me
79/100 Underrated little gem of a film. Layered, focused and bold treatment of its subject matter. A rather involving thriller that feels fresh. KIFF Day 7 Film 24
Go into this knowing as little as possible. There's some loose ends that bother me, but I can't remember a movie that surprised me the way this one did. It goes to show that no matter how much you think you've seen it all...you really haven't. Not even close. And especially not here.
At it's core this movie is a romantic drama in the best sense, which I wasn't expecting. The chemistry between the two leads is so great.
This movie made me feel weird. Not because of the physical "ugliness" of the two main characters or anything they were shown doing, but rather the direction in which the story went. I tried to go into this knowing as little as possible, and I kind of kept wanting to go back to the movie where Tina took walks and calmly hung out with a fox and a moose in her backyard—perhaps so did she. Even still, there is a lot to appreciate and take in during this relatively short runtime, and I think it may take me a bit to unpack it all. Definitely see this if it's showing at a theater near you. And with MoviePass as a distributor, anyone with an open mind who hasn't cancelled their membership yet should use it to see this.
A beautifully bizzare exploration on identity  Coincidentally I recently caught up with both Let the Right One In and Let Me In after seeing a staged production of Let the Right One In and it was perfectly timed to prepare me for the writer's new film based on his short story. I loved this even more than both of those but they all have a beautiful connection of the other trying to connect with human society but their so called imperfections keep them distant. Eva Melander gives a truly stunning performance as Tina a troll who uses her heighten senses for good as a border guard inspecting bags and finding someone like her one day and connecting for the first time in her life to someone like her. She wears lots of make up for this role but the make up design and her tremendous acting ability are in perfect sync and she gets a lot of emotion out of her eyes and reactions over the make up. She wants to fit in with the human world buying groceries and living in a house with a human but still gets the side eye and called names but finally meets someone like her that makes her feel seen for who she is truly and even encourages her to embrace totally her troll side and turn on the humans. It's a really great meditation about identity and sense of purpose in the world. It's an impeccably directed and well written fairy tale like Let the Right One In and Let Me In were but I was taken with this even more and felt similar to The Shape of Water but getting the perspective from "the other". It also has some unforgettable shots and scenes involving the anatomy of these trolls. The screenplay is also really well plotted with twists and connection that make earlier scenes make much more sense if you are truly engaged and following along so I encourage you to seek this one out in a theater where you aren't distracted. One of my favorite foreign films of the year and hoping the Oscars remember it for Foreign Film and Make Up at the very least.
Can’t tell if this film is too weird to be taken seriously
Not sure how I feel about this one. I'm gonna think about it!
I'd give almost anything to be able to wipe this film from my memory.
Tina is a home owner and a dutiful daughter to her aging father. She is a TSA screener, or whatever the equivalent for that is in Sweden. Tina is very good at her job. She was actually born with a "chromosomal disorder" that enables her to smell contraband better than any human, possibly even better than most trained dogs. Not just any contraband, either. To say what she detects would spoil a big part of the enjoyment for the viewer but let's just say it is evident that Tina has some kind of superpower. Tina's chromosomal disorder also makes her about as far from traditionally beautiful as any woman can get. But she is beautiful and she knows it. She just hasn't met anyone she has ever felt in common with or who can honestly treat her as a romantic partner the way she deserves. And then she meets a tall dark stranger named Voge. Voge has similar abilities, and similar deficits. He has never been able to stay in one civilized place for very long, he is both more experienced and more dangerous. Just how experienced and just how dangerous Voge is is the centerpiece of the most suspenseful, bizarre and deeply satisfying mystery of the year. Looking for a double feature? Pair it with last year's best telekinesis movie of the year, Thelma from Norway's #JoachimTrier. So sayeth the King of Funny Faces.
if you plan on watching sweden’s oscar submission this year, i strongly recommend not to read any detailed reviews about the film. not because they are negative (the opposite in fact — 98% score on rotten tomatoes!) but because there are lots of plot reveals that will ruin the experience of watching this truly enchanting and original tale about identity and the mass anti-immigration hysteria that’s gripping the uninformed and ignorant among us. “border” won the un certain regard at cannes this year and tells the story of tina, a gifted border patrol agent whose heightened sense of smell can detect anyone who are hiding anything from the law. she’s different. she knows it. one day, she encounters a mysterious person who “looks” like her. she’s curious and she begins to question her identity. there’s a major revelation halfway through the movie followed by a scene never before depicted on screen that will leave you in complete and utter awe!  ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
Not since Let the Right One In has there been a story that so beautifully describes “otherness”
A touching modern fairy tale that touches on many different themes and ideas. Border certainly isn’t perfect but that’s ok, because it does so much that’s genuinely exciting. I’m trying to think of a way to explain why I love this film without spoiling it???  It grapples with so many different topics, but without losing focus. One thing I admire is the way it addresses issues like imperialism, racism and xenophobia while still remaining distinctly Scandinavian. Also as a trans person I was so excited by that scene at the airport. And the sex scene. There’s so much room for a queer reading here and if I ever write a more complete review of this film I’ll definitely be pursuing that.
this ain’t it
This was really weird and awesome. When I found out this was written by the same person who did Let The Right One In, I knew what to expect: Strange, Beautiful, Swedish.  Highly recommend this!  “Even when we find the one, we are still alone.” -my mom
Kinda loses it with the procedural stuff and there’s one major detail left unexplained related to Scandinavian mythology that the filmmakers seem to think is common knowledge when it is absolutely not, buuuut the parts of this that are simply about trying to live in the world and among people without collapsing in despair or boiling over in rage are assured and galvanizing. PS Everybody who says the sex scene was gross should be forced to tape and watch themselves having sex so they realize just how disgusting every single human body is we are monsters.
gives me nightmares just to think about it
Really wanted to like this for its admirable strangeness and ambition, but I just could not connect with the leads here, who seemingly walked straight from one of those caveman Geico ads and into a dreary, morose work of magical realism. Not without the occasional moment of intrigue (that sex scene is... a lot), and the craft is undeniably there, so you could very well cite a lack of taste for my finding this to be a bit of a slog.
Divisive narrative about living a non-mainstream life in a culture of others. Personally I liked the moral ambiguity and the gender fluidity. I like all of it, in fact. But then I have a pretty ambiguous relationship with the status quo. Your mileage may vary.
This was good but was all that stuff about children........ necessary
felt a lot of things and aroused was absolutely not one of them
I don’t know why everyone calls this so original and weird. It’s about trolls and that brings some weird (possibly made-up by Abbasi) mythology into play, but when you ignore that it’s quite a standard movie. Outcast meets outcast, they fall in love. Everything isn’t what it seems. It’s almost like the standard YA novel where the main protagonist discovers she truly is different, meets a guy who makes her see she’s beautiful and they go save the world. The last part isn’t exactly true here, so there I’d give it some points for originality. But if we go back to darker fairytales and myths it might not be that shocking either. Because of the standardness being the base of the story I got quite bored. I kind of found the whole detective part about child porn interesting, but in the end it doesn’t really feel wrapped up and it is only there to support the main arc, instead of working on its own. There also are some questions about what makes a monster, but that also feels pretty basic and has been asked in better movies before. So no... I absolutely don’t get why I see so much positivity surrounding this.
This movie is insane. Go into it knowing as little as possible. Just know that it has arguably the most bizarre sex scene you'll see in 2018.
The most disgustingest sex scene.
I love it when a film refuses to stick to a genre, but instead seamlessly glides from one set of imagery and rules to the next. Scandi-noir to fairy tale to family drama and back again. Similar in ambition to Let the Right One In, which is likewise based on a book by John Ajvide Lindquist.
Went into this blind and man was it a treat. The part of the film dealing with these outsiders finding each other and becoming close was really great. The performances from the two leads were incredible. The 2nd half of the film, while I liked it, did seem a bit too rushed. I wish it focused a bit more on these character's relationships before jumping into the more thriller-esque plot. Also, the ending was not necessarily bad but it was a bit predictable. I think my favorite part of the movie was the feeling it gives off; it has a mysterious, haunting, and beautiful tone which was very engrossing. Grade: B+
Nope. Absolutely the fuck not. Such a disgusting movie, so narrowly intent on grossing you out. It's used to kind of cool effect by the end, but it's in no way worth what the movie is clearly delighting in putting you through. Every five fucking seconds this movie made me gag. Not even just the literally gross stuff (eating maggots, fun!) but the whole vibe of the movie is just repulsive (see the continual use of child molestation as a plot point, they go out of their way to make it as gross as possible too). I get that the repulsion is part of the point, once the twist happens, but what follows I've seen many times before, *without* this much suffering. This movie delights in activating your gag reflex. I wish I'd walked out. Watched at AMC Sunset. The guy behind me straight up devoured chicken strips during this. Barf.
What begins as a modestly odd tale of isolation and otherness slowly unfolds into a truly strange and special exploration of trauma and identity in a way that I never expected. This is a profoundly weird movie, but it is profound, and I found myself hooked, despite some pacing issues that should have left me just a bit bored (but didn’t). It helps that even under the prosthetics and false teeth, both leads (Eva Milander and Eero Milonoff) give engaging performances.
Well anchored in its unique conception, Border can be tender and liberating, furious and disgusting, and even polemic in its vision of decaying humankind. In this case, and for its arresting visuals and compelling narrative, it’s easy to conclude that this is no minor work.
Chloe, the Director or Barketing at Moviepass, recommended this one to me!
All the makings of a weekly hour-long police procedural - "The Nose Knows" Next time I hear anyone mention the risqué sex scenes of Fifty Shades or nonsense like that, I'm just going to laugh and say they've seen nothing at all until they've seen troll sex.
On the border of inhumane and intimate. I thought I understand what Ali was going for until the second half where everything I tried to rationalize was flipped and turned into a twisted fantasy.  But I would say they somewhat eased into it but that’s when I was lost on what to take away from the film. Update: I think I’ve digested it now I love the way it portrayed differences in humanity and how it separates us and shows the animalistic nature of humans in the way they treat eachother. It’s a movie that, at first glance is unpleasant to look at because of the muted colors and the fiflthy and uncivilized scenes of mudsex and eating maggots but you come to find beauty in these things that are natural just as Reva and Vore find beauty in eachother and being close to nature. Beware the troll penis.
Knowledge is liberation and understanding the self has value. Border is about Tina, a woman who is different in more ways than one, discovering who she is and allowing herself to see that her difference isn't "ugly". Under the genre of romance. fantasy and horror the exploration of the self is twisted in a way that I have never seen before. My heart ached for Tina along the blue tones visuals and the dark narrative that keeps digging.
Strong start, then it shoots itself in the foot and you kind of watch it bleed out for the last half hour. A very ALMOST experience.
From the hilarious reviews here, this is obviously freaking people out. Needless to say, highly recommended. Just look at the gorgeous trailer.
I had no idea what this movie was going to be about.  I freaking loved it.   Constantly surprised by this small little movie about love and identity - reimagining what a fairy tale would be like today.
Some kinda cool, affirmation of monstrous bodies. Too long though, makes its point and keeps making it instead of moving forward, not visually or tonally interesting enough to make that worthwhile
Pretty damn strange. It’s like if someone took Twilight and made it ugly and more narratively interesting. It’s pretty slow though and ultimately leaves you wanting something more.
A Swedish arthouse version of the X-Men.
Well. That was extremely upsetting
Well, that was quite something. Felt that the thriller subplot was a bit unnecessary, but the main plot was well done and quite moving. Also, some of the scenes in this are amongst the weirdest stuff I've seen this year in film.
Not to sound like Jeff Wells but I found everyone and everything in this repulsive and had to fight the urge to flee the theater half a dozen times during the film. Melander and Milonoff are, of course, buried under Cro-Magnon-esque prosthetics and like the characters in LET THE ONE RIGHT IN (which, like this film, is based on the writing of John Ajvide Lindqvist) we’re meant to overlook the character’s more grotesque personal habits and Cronenbergian physiology and recognize their "inner beauty." And if my only objection was being grossed out by the two doughy actors cavorting through the woods like a couple of slope-browed, naked hobbits then you’d be right to mock me for being shallow. But the burgeoning romance between outsiders runs parallel to an astonishingly ill-advised and legally dubious* police procedural b-story that centers around literal infant rape that ultimately dovetails with our two lovers in a way that made me want to take a shower. The message of this film amounts to you can’t judge a book by its cover… except when you can and totally should. *I don’t know how the law works exactly in Sweden but I’m guessing evidence taken from a potential crime scene, secured without a warrant, because an immigration officer has the ability to “smell guilt” wouldn’t hold up in court.
Yorgos Lanthimos meets David Cronenberg in this mind bending debut feature from Sweden, which also happens to be Sweden’s official Oscar entry. @BorderMovie shocks you in the most surreal and elegant manner possible. Review: goo.gl/Dt9MCn  (64rd 🎥/2018) #MAMI2018
One of the most awkward, but well done movies I’ve seen all year. I wish this got a bigger theater release.
Incredible well made. BUT SHOULD IT HAVE BEEN MADE??? I really can’t decide.
I walked out of this screening saying “I could rant why this doesn’t work, but it’s not worth my energy.”  Border is a film that works on paper, and has one of the most intriguing opening 20 minutes I’ve ever seen. From there, it decided to be [at least] three different movies. In the proces, it completely dropsthe more interesting subtexts it originally established in favor of some pretty  distasteful elements. Once this happened, I found myself bored. While I wouldn’t say I was ever annoyed enough to walk out of the theater, I did space out,l. When I tuned back in, I think, “Oh god I missed so much!” before spacing out again five minutes later. The midpoint is genuinely weird – but maybe only weird for the sake of being weird – and kept me on the edge of my seat, although not in a good way. I did hope after that that things would start to click, but soon enough I was bored again.  The lead here is stellar, but most of the other performances were subpar, or the character was too obtuse for me to ever get them. While there was never anything wrong on a technical level, it also wasn’t ever interesting. This is a subpar movie that I wish I hadn’t paid to see. If I had streamed it, I would’ve been happier. While it works on paper, it’s ultimately too messy to ever live up to it’s marketed expectations.
I may be a bit overly subjective here, but personally I didn’t enjoy it much and also genuinely didn’t think its impact justified the film. The film relies on the fact that you are with it, and I was not. Possibly my fault, but especially on films where I go in clean I feel like it’s not my responsibility to work to care. The film should make me care (and most do).   The film really alienated me before it got where it was going emotionally. I was intrigued by a sense of mystery, but then the answer to that mystery (slight spoiler) was something that was basically a sort of deus ex machina. It was so grounded in reality, then decided to be entirely fantasy. I found it really alienating after learning to be with these characters in a realistic setting.  As for its message, it just wasn’t anything we haven’t seen a million times before. Honestly. And I was so pulled out of the film by it subverting expectations so suddenly that I didn’t feel like it earned the grand reckoning that we are meant to feel for the character. It also felt like the second half, where all of this happened, was much more rushed than the first half. It made it really hard to feel for the character when I was still trying to feel for myself.  But I loved the prosthetics and visual effects. It looked really great. And to be both clear and fair, I can see the draw of this film. It just wasn’t for me- I never got the sense of beauty in the story that I was expected to get and that turned me off to it.  I watched this at the IFC Center, which I’m convinced has the best popcorn in the city.
I understand why this is getting the attention it is but I don't know I kept hoping for any of it to matter. Hard to thread social realism, crime thriller, and mythic fairytale into a coherent film but it sure gives it a shot. The awakening-identity sequence was lovely though.
I've never been to Sweden and I haven't seen THAT many Swedish movies and this movie is nigh-impossible to classify AND YET this feels... extremely Swedish.
Eva Melander’s incredible transformation and Oscar-caliber performance is worth your price of admission. Absolutely stunning.
Gorgeous scandithriller fairytale
Hi yes ok um what the fuck! I need somebody else to watch this ASAP just to make sure that I didn’t fall asleep in the theater before the movie started and this wasn’t a 2 hour fever dream I had! Which, strangely enough, this did not feel like it was almost 2 hours. I checked my phone once to see the time, thinking there was like an hour left, and I had only 10 mins of the movie left. It felt like some weird Ang™ time warp in theater 5.  All that being said tho, I didn’t hate this movie? It freaked my shit and I kinda liked it?
I thought this was utterly fascinating, never quite knowing where it was leading but enthralled all the same. Your mileage may vary regarding whether some of this is in "bad taste" or merely a freak show to giggle at uncomfortably but I found it remarkably empathetic to Tina's plight. The central metaphor is loose enough that you could tie it to pretty much anything you might want but I personally found the film to be most rewarding when viewed through the lens of a particularly feminine anger, at the constraints the world places on women, the bliss that can be found in breaking free, and the disappointment and rage that can come with discovering freedom often comes at a price. I don't think this one will be easy to shake.
A bit of a slow burn, but fantastically unique and interesting. Primal and raw, emotionally and physically. Very human and intimate
And the award for weirdest sex scene goes to...
A grotesque fairytale that does achieve a certain weird power, but it wallows in gross-out detail, over-complicates the plot, and doesn't know if it wants to be about empowerment or making a choice. Not what I expected, knowing nothing of the plot - given the title, and an Iranian-Swedish director, I thought it was going to be about migrants (maybe it is? it'd be pretty ballsy, viewed as politically-incorrect metaphor about Islamism as a Muslim's 'true nature') - not what I really wanted either.
One of the most uncomfortable, cringe-worthy experiences I've ever had in a theater. People got up and walked out on more than one occasion in reaction to certain scenes; so forewarning that this is not for those with weak stomachs. That being said, it touches on themes of belonging, professional duty, and even human sanctity itself in ways that I've never seen broached before - and that earns some genuine originality points from me. I will never watch this movie again, but I'm reluctantly glad that I experienced it (and crucially with no prior knowledge of how it would unfold) the one time. C+
Themes of alienation, cruelty and grotesqueness are depicted and explored in an original and fairly abstract form. Despite the unreal setting, the movie draws you in completely. It gives a lot more food for thought, than would be expected if only presented with the premise and outline.
I GOT THIS FEELIN, INSIDE MY BONES
If I had a tail, I’d tell it just the same.
wow. this one needs some time to digest. Beautifully told story. Acting, writing, directing all top notch. Some disturbing moments that work well in the movie as it unravels.
This was really hard to watch. Normally random foreign indie movies are my jam, but this just made me so uncomfy. Best makeup and costumes maybe?
This movie is so weird and so interesting and I can’t stop thinking about it. Incredible make up work, too.
Nordic fantasy Smells like something isn't quite right Finding yourself, here
Shattuck Cinemas I was honestly expecting something a little less conventional, in terms of plot / film style / attempts at characterization. Half of it is a police procedural!?
They announced a Shrek reboot today and, even though this movie is about trolls, I fully expect the Shrek reboot to look like this.
Fascinating in its subversion of typical genre tropes, 'Border' is strange in the best possible way. I think the movie looses some steam towards the end when it takes a bit of a predictable path, but even then, the story beats are well established and set-up so I can't really complain; in the movie's defense, this predictability isn't treated as if it's the greatest surprise in the world or played over-dramatically. Like the rest of the film, it's handled with humanity and emotion. I don't know if the movie completely succeeds, but it's a rare film that I legitimately had no clue where it could go for most of the runtime. I don't want to say anything about it, but man, the whole audience at my showing was wide-eyed and silent and sat through a good chunk of the credits before standing up-- it's that sort of movie.

Border explores some very dark corners, but it explores these boundaries with an assured hand and captivating storytelling. Boulder Weekly
One of the most interesting and original movies I’ve seen in a very long time. Beautiful and deep. Went into this without knowing anything and loved it, one of 2018’s best.
Disappointingly stupid in every level! Just have one question. harley quinn maybe cray cray but how the hell did she survive that fight without damaging her ass or getting stuff suck there!??
i could have written, directed and acted on the same level as them
This is the first and only time I've ever audibly boo'd a film as I watched it in a theater.
If I never think about this film again I’ll be satisfied. Not happy. True happiness could only be achieved if someone erased this film from my mind and the face of the planet simultaneously.
Is it as bad as you heard it was? Yeah, pretty much. Random scenes that add up to nothing, boring plot, mediocre action, indistinguishable characters with zero depth, suffocatingly obvious music choices from start to finish and cringeworthy humour and one-liners. Viola Davis and Margot Robbie were the only entertaining parts about this whole sorry affair.
It was boring. The first hour there was no plot at all... And the movie lasts for over 2h The movie drags on.

With all those announced and postponed dceu films coming out and how complicated it is they should just scrap it all and make only Captain Boomerang films
Irrational plot
I heard terrible terrible things about this. The reality somehow still was below my expectations. Here is a list of random thoughts I had about this film. The order is more or less as well though out and comprehensible as the plot of the film. - In the opening shot, the black text at the bottom of the screen establishing the location slides over a patch of black/brown ground and immediately is unreadable. The editing in general is so incomprehensible that you can't really understand it until you see it. - Whoever has the power to ban Jared Leto from life, can they please do so. He occasionally barges into the plot for no apparent reason. At one point he lies on the ground surrounded by various weapons and children's clothing. LOL SO RANDOM... He seems to be doing a bad heath ledger impersonation which has the side effect of making him incomprehensible at points. Possibly this inadvertently improves the film - It takes about 40 minutes, nearly a third of the runtime, just on the opening exposition dump and setting up the members/plot. It could pretty much have started 40 minutes in and nothing changes. - The suicide squad helicopter gets shot down by gunfire, but I cannot for the life of me work out who did it. I think enchantress and her brother were the only people who were threats in the city at the time, who don't use guns. Whoever did it seems to just vanish into the night. - During a firefight, someone seems to be firing a laser gun. Who has this, how and why I cannot work out. Its bizzare. It shows up at various other times as well but you can never see where it comes from. Later some random person in a helicopter uses a laser gatling thing - a helicopter which definitely wasn't there any other time. -Conceptually the entire thing is stupid right off the bat. For some inexplicable reason, the government decides that to assemble a squad that can take on superman if he turned evil, or another similar threat occurred. They then filled this squad almost entirely of regular human people. Unless superman has a crippling fear of boomerangs, I doubt they'll go far. Katana is probably the one character who's actually pretty cool. She has a handful of lines, some of which are in Japanese and underrated. This is a criminal misuse of a character whose sword sucks in the souls of people she kills. Criminal. - People seem to just do random things in this film for no apparent reason. - At least killer Croc has a positive body image about himself? Yay? - This wants to be guardians of the galaxy so hard. El Diablo has a line about them being a family which is SO unearned. - The effect of Dr Moon's hand flipping to enchantress' hand was good. There are occasional other nice effects around her, like when she reaches out of the mirror. In conclusion: suicide squad bad; #rehirejamesgunn4suicidesquad2; katana solo film please.
i'm baffled that anyone thought this was good
Rating this with 1 star is being too much generous? This is a DC stan asking.
this is just a two hour long commercial for hot topic
After two years I've finally seen it... It was pure, unadulterated trash. It felt to me like a big huge gigant trailer compilation, and the only thing that I liked was Margot Robbie, cause she is beautiful and charismatic and I wish she to kidnap me and torture me in a weirdly fetichistic yet kind and nurturing way.
Arguably one of the worst films of all time. I will never forget the uncomfortable 2 hours and 17 minutes of silence in the full cinema as I was forced to witness this abomination of a 'film' with my own two eyes.
This was honestly one of the worst movies I've seen. Certainly the worst superhero movie. The only redeeming things have been some cool Will Smith scenes and the perfectly cast Margot Robbie (hey, I don't blame her for the bad writing). Other than that it was an atrocious mess. Cringy dialogue, some really bad acting (especially by Delevingne and Kinnaman), the worst iteration of the Joker I've seen to date (to be fair to Leto, I understand a lot of his scenes have been cut - but I can only judge what I can see) and a horrible plot. I mean, come on - everything can be handled with bombs? Antique God? Just blow him up. Some weird magical weapon destined to destroy the earth? Just blow it up. Ridiculous. At the end of the movie I definitely wanted to join the Suicide Squad by killing myself.
the only three good thingd about this movie was viola davis, margot robbie and the soundtrack. now i see we didn't need more than the trailer itself.
Better then expected. Better (darker) then the avengers except infinity war.
Suicide Squad Review 44 DCEU catch up before Aquaman part 3. After Man if Steel I was really hopeful that the rest of the movies would be just as good if not better. Let’s just say I was disappointed. I liked how this movie was setting up but its execution was very poor. It was entertaining most of the way through but its plot and some of the silly moments took away from it heavily. Also again questioning how many innocent people died... abuse again it’s a lot. Batman V Superman is next, I’m still hopeful.
it wasn’t that good but also i was removed from the theater for a solid 20 minutes.
heath ledger rose from the grave to slice jared leto’s kneecaps over this
At least whenever the next Joker comes around, people won't have to compare him to the impossibly high standard of Heath Ledger. Now they can compare it to the impossibly low standard of Jared Leto!!
Oof. Suicide Squad is okay, kind of fun, but could have been much better. I wanted to like it! My body was ready. I wanted the whole movie to be like the opening 20 minutes, the closing credits, and the poster. It felt like it wanted to be Deadpool, more or less. That would have been great! So would a version directed by, say, Justin Lin. It's got its moments, but nowhere near enough of them.﻿
Can anyone honestly tell me what this on fire carnival is about?
The script wasn't that good (a lot of dialogue, especially from Smith and Robbie, is really choppy and forced in for no real reason). There were also a few dumb scenes, such as Harley commiting a THEFT right in front of a MILITARY OFFICER. The pacing was kind of off at the beginning, with like 10 whole minutes giving all the characters (except Slipknot) hype videos as if it was a Smash Bros Game. Killer Croc's character would have been better off not speaking at all. I couldn't understand a word he said. Also, how come NONE of the good metahumans out there took any interest in what was going on? Alright, now for the good stuff. First, the whole premise is actually very interesting. I'm usually not a big fan of movies with a villain as the protagonist, especially superhero movies, because they're always going to "turn good" and be redeemed, which is the opposite of the point of having villains. But they change it up here. Instead of fighting the bad guy, they're being forced by THE GOVERNMENT to do it. Even if characters like Harley and El Diablo had "redeeming moments", they still remain bad guys, and are still thought of by the public as villains. DC doesn't get enough credit for having more original stories. Second, the characters are interesting. The ones that are important to the story (so, everyone but Slipknot) is given just enough backstory to allow the audience to understand and feel for the characters, while still thinking of them as "bad guys". Third, the action. Seeing bad guys fight faceless CGI army men for a good cause, while still being bad guys is an awesome thing to see. The effects and makeup were very good (even Oscar-worthy). Also, I loved how they added in cameos from Batman and the Flash, (whom this was his first real appearance on screen). It didn't feel shoehorned in. Finally, I don't understand the hate that Jared Leto's Joker gets. Yeah, his performance isn't as good as Ledger's but you'll never get him back (RIP). Get over it. Leto's performance isn't bad. It's actually quite good for what it is. What is it?, you may ask. Well, Nicholson's Joker was basically a mob-boss who had a few screws loose, but still had his wits. Ledger's Joker was a full-on psycho who THOUGHT he was perfectly sane. (I'm not even gonna mention Romero). I like to think that Leto is playing a mix between the two. He's definitely a mob boss, and he knows exactly what he's doing, but he's also has a very messed up head. I think the film would have benefited greatly from more of him. I hope they do more with him in the future. Oh, and I think the film should have taken place at Arkham Aylum. You've got big, well-known villains like Harley Quinn, Killer Croc, and Deadshot being kept at a PENITENTIARY instead of an INSANSE ASYLUM. So yeah. It's not perfect, but it's enjoyable. I don't think it was ever supposed to be a "good" film, but it does NOT deserve all the hate it gets.
1st Watch
Se Guardians of the Galaxy istället.
A mess story and pacing-wise, but all the main actors were on fleek
one star because of Jared Leto/ edited : 17h48 : lemme take back what i said i don’t support any abuser bye
Imagine a turd. Also imagine that turd if it had a talking crocodile who ate fried chicken, went to jail, and watched BET.
There was a movie somewhere in that mess, Robbie was awesome, Leto ok, awkwardly moralistic, structurally munted, pretty fun!
Loved the soundtrack. Harley Quinn was cool but Jared Leto as the joker was not my favorite.
Bright colors and Margot Robbie spreading her butt-cheeks isn't going to distract me from how horrendous this movie is.
HEY EVERYBODY IT’S HOT TOPIC CLEARANCE RACK: THE MOVIE! Listen to me and the wonderful Megan Holiday talk a whole bunch of shit about this cinematic failure on our episode of Blockbusting.
More boring than I would have believed possible.
Sally annoyed my fin gutbags so much during this film that it was hard to enjoy it. Love Yoda (The Loveable P G even) Typed by Lewy
This is the third time I’ve watched Suicide Squad, and I enjoyed it more this time than I did the last two times. The main characters are all likeable, and the story is really good. I always really enjoy the part where they introduce the members of the Suicide Squad. The soundtrack is also mostly really good. Any soundtrack that has Queen and Kanye West is going to be awesome. One thing I was thinking about while watching this was that I really like the CGI in the DCEU films. It has a kind of unique style that I really like, and it looks a lot more interesting than the CGI in most other superhero films. Anyway, I would like to see more of these characters in the future, and I think Jared Leto would be a really great Joker with more screen time.
yes. What
will and margot
Joker and Harley are so cute omg 😍😍
two stars one for deadshot and another for harley
I really wanted to like this movie but the plot was just soooo bad.
What is this, some kinda movie review?
Suicide is no joke this hole movie was really inconsiderate. 0/10,64
I couldn't finish this. I don't know how this was released.
So bad it’s not worth my time to write about.
I wanted to love it so much, one of the best trailers I’ve ever seen, but movie had the most non sensical plot I’ve ever seen from a AAA production.
It starts to grow on me.
What a shame, this could've been the breaking off point for the DCEU, a cool premise, with usually charming characters, I was actually excited for this film, then I saw set photos, I was a little disappointed, but still excited, then the movie came out and, well, shit. Will Smith is a lot of fun and sympathetic as Deadshot, Margot Robbie is good a Harley Quinn, Jai Courtney's best performance (as sad as that statement is), and they brought in Katana, a badass character, who looks cool... And they barely ever show her. Jared Leto as the Joker is very forgettable, even if he was the main villain, his performance was severely lacking. As for the main villain, I don't remember a thing about her, except for the belly dances from Hell.
Nope. Not a fan.
My school voted this the best film of 2016 and I've now fully lost faith in the youth of today.
this movie caused the “nOrMAL iS A sEtTING oN a dRYER!!” quote to go viral and for that I can’t enjoy it.
Has to be one of the worst movies I’ve ever seen. An absolute joyless mess.
every bad idea ever was put into this film
This is a so bad it's good movie for me, My friend caught this movie and laughed almost all the way through the movie. There are so many terrible lines that are very quotable. The effects are laughable at times, characters are written and preformed so astonishingly bad that you have no option but to laugh at the movie. The movie as a whole makes no sense, why would you hire dangerous and unstable criminals with very little to no superpowers to save the world. Where are the superheros that are in this universe. This is a world ending event. We see batman twice during the movie but not near the end when the world is actually moments away from ending. It's a genuinely fantastic time, and a must watch if you find overwhelmingly incompetent film making to be funny.
Back in 1987, DC Comics started publishing Suicide Squad by John Ostrander and Luke McDonnell. Ostrander's brilliant premise was this: in a world of independent, potentially dangerous people and aliens with powers far beyond those of mortal men, the American government found itself in need of a covert task force of equally super-powered people to counter the perceived threat. Government agent Amanda Waller - one of the great creations of modern comics - recruits a team of so-called super-villains into Task Force X, offering them time off their prison sentences in exchange for engaging in suicide missions for the government. They really have little choice, because Waller has implanted bombs in their necks that can be set off remotely if the villains try to escape or otherwise disobey. Colloquially, they're known as the Suicide Squad, since the odds of coming back from any given mission are slim. This paranoid, cynical premise is a perfect reflection of the late cold war era, and Ostrander played on the tropes of the time brilliantly, giving the villainous characters depth rivaling and even surpassing DC's more famous protagonists - Batman, Wonder Woman, Superman and all the rest. During the course of the series one-note villains such as the ludicrous Captain Boomerang or the deeply damaged Deadshot are given new dimensions; as I reader, I found myself sympathizing with them even on those occasions when they were put into conflict with the mainstream heroes. Over the course of five years and 63 issues, Ostrander and his team delivered engaging, morally ambiguous stories rich with drama, action and character development, while also offering wry commentary on the politics of the day. When I heard that Suicide Squad was to be adapted to film, I was equal parts excited and wary. Summer blockbusters are not the ideal venue to explore the more subtle aspects of Ostrander's original comic; it would be all to easy to simply skim off the surface of the work - the action and some character beats - throw them into a few chase and fight sequences and call it a day. And indeed, that's exactly what's happened with David Ayer's big screen Suicide Squad. The film is front-loaded with exposition, it's too dark - not in tone, but visually - and the villain is a one-note mystical force when what this film needed was a more grounded first mission. To a degree, I enjoyed the treatment of the Squad members: assassin Deadshot, petty crook Captain Boomerang, the deranged clown princess of crime, Harley Quinn, the monstrous, mutated Killer Croc, the witch-possessed Enchantress, the ex-gang banger El Diablo, and their government overseers, Colonel Rick Flag and Katana, who wields a sword that steals the souls of those it kills. Of course this reads as somewhat ridiculous, but part of enjoying this genre is accepting that the world of superheroics includes all manner of wondrous and bizarre properties. What makes the film work (to the limited extent that it does) is the way these characters interact with each other and how they respond to the situation Amanda Waller and the government have imposed upon them. They are, to say the least, reluctant heroes, and the antagonistic griping slung back and forth is one of the small delights of the film. The other is the way in which the backstories of several of the characters are revealed, particularly Deadshot, Harley Quinn and El Diablo. Each has his or her own dreams and fears, some realized, some not by the movie's end. The mission itself is simple and linear: the squad has to fight its way through horde of monsters to first rescue an important figure trapped in the fray, and then to take out the threat itself. While not nearly as well done as similar sequences in Dredd or The Raid: Redemption, the combination of action and character interplay keeps the film moderately entertaining, and the final showdown itself is well-executed, has some emotional weight, and even lives up to the title in ways I won't spoil. The film also benefits from a great soundtrack and a neon purple-green colour palette that should have been used for more than the opening exposition sequences and the opening and closing credits; they give the film a very distinctive look during the sections where it's used, and could have livened up the (literally) darker sections of the movie. The cameos from other DC characters feel unforced and natural, organic to the story, another plus. Unfortunately, while Jared Leto gives his all as the Joker, his interpretation just doesn't work. It's possible that I'm being too easy on the film, given that it comes in the wake of the truly awful Batman v. Superman: Dawn of Justice. But for the first time after watching one of the modern DC movies, I actually want to see more of these characters and their world. Finally, the mid-credits sequence drops a very tantalizing possibility, one I hope a competent filmmaker realizes. Suicide Squad is by no means a great movie, but it has a goofy charm thanks primarily to the charisma and pain of its core characters. Given a little polish and extra time in the editing room, it may have almost lived up to the comic itself. It doesn't reach that point - it doesn't really come close - but Suicide Squad (the film), deserves credit for ambition, if nothing else, and for showing the humanity in monsters and the monsters in humanity.
Two hours of my life that will never go back.
Fascinatingly awful. The first hour of this feels like fifty online only shorts played in random order, at least five of which are called 'Meet Deadshot!' and none of which contain anything of value or interest - I genuinely don't think an editor saw the final cut before it went out. The soundtrack cues feel like the result of absolutely minimal thought and infinite budget. Margot Robbie's great but only in a way that cuts well for trailers, because the script's intense, feverish loathing for women won't allow her anything to actually do, and her relationship with Jared Leto (who is absolutely, inexcusably awful) is somehow even more irresponsibly portrayed than I expected. The cast all deserve some credit, but barely get to do more than pose, bark milquetoast background dialogue and, if they're lucky, deliver a confusing and uninteresting expositional monologue. There's a stretch at the beginning of the third act where the action slows down, becomes linear and feels like a film - not a great one, but a film nonetheless. The endless parade of reshoots, re-cuts and nigh-on rebrands are never more obvious than at this point where, you have to assume, you're seeing the longest remaining stretch of the first cut. Of all the films coke-and-market-researched to death of the last few decades, this might be the most blatant act of self-immolation. In the end, the funniest part, by far, is that David Ayer still ended up with a sole writing credit.
What a fucking mess. I don’t even know where to begin honestly. The acting wasn’t great, the plot was sub par at most, and the movie feels like its 20 minutes long. But, the makeup was pretty good so thats cool
I'm in love with Harley Quinn
We don't talk about this.
I did actually spend money on a movie ticket for this one
It was fun and thats all i wanted. I cant wait for margot robbie to take control of the dc universe.
Mediocre acting, awful editing, laughable dialogues and Slipknot... "The man who can climb anything"
And here I thought that a supervillain action flick might fare better than a superhero one. My bad. This seemed desperate to be badass, but also wanted to be some dark fairytale with witches and demons and magic? '•_•' Man, fuck this shit. I'm going back to real movies for a while.
Margot Robbie slays but this movie is still a fucking mess.
Review attached here: moviesshouldbegood.tumblr.com/post/149585521259/suicide-squad-review-by-nathan At the time of reviewing, I thought it was ok. This got much, much worse as more time passed on.
2 Stars Best Performance: Will Smith Scene Stealer: Jay Hernandez Score/Soundtrack: 7/10 Worth Seeing in Theaters? Surprisingly, yes, but tread lightly Rewatch Factor: 4/10 Additional Notes: Worst of the DC movies, and just a freakin mess. Awful plot, awful villains, poor acting. It's just a bad movie.
Oh god... This is a TOTAL mess, I mean, who edited this thing? So I haven’t seen this movie since its release, and at that time I thought it wasn’t that bad, I was wrong back then. However there are a few points in this movie that I actually kind of enjoy.
"Y'all jokers must be crazy." - Deadshot, - DCU Rankings: boxd.it/2a2kw What a confusing mess this film turned out to be. I feel like I just watched the two hour long trailer for a nine hour long movie.
Seen in this so-much needed time of mindless entertainment, I think it deserves some words, and not only because I'm quickly discovering myself as a DC fanboy. To write a defense about it is a hard task, since the movie is guilty of all the sins which are commonly acknowledged. It has a messy script, the most decipherable element with a judgement practiced and biased by tv shows, and it doesn't pander to critics and audience with trending themes and pop-culture references. I’ve always thought that the script in the end is the most expendable element in a film, so I can easily pass on that, even if its defects drag along similar problems in direction and editing. But in the there are three elements that pretty much make amends for everything else, making Suicide Squad a pretty enjoyable flick with a high entertainment value. The first one is the anarchy of its mise en-scene. Unfortunately it is merely the lucky result of a troubled set and a confused direction, where the editing department was left with the most difficult part of the job. Nevertheless its asymmetrical construction and confused development match the silliness of its protagonists. The rhythm is incredibly fast, there are no weak moments until the very end. And for last, the cast. It is a perfect example of how a good casting can save a bad film. In this case, everything is carried on Will Smith and Margot Robbie’s shoulders. It is one of the few things Ayer got right (or -better- where the production didn’t interfere), deciding to focus the film on them. Smith is a renowned star, and has made a career out of saving shitty movies with just his presence; of course he was the perfect choice for Deadshot. So was Margot Robbie for Harley Quinn; it was her breakout performance, launching her in what will be an extraordinary career.
One of the worst movies of all time? I mean....
i don't even want to imagine how bad this would be if margot robbie wasn't in it.
Short n' sweet: For an actual Suicide Squad film, watch this as an alternative. Dumpster fire not even worth talking about.
This is a movie that fails on just about every conceivable level. All the rumours you hear about the nightmarish production and release, it doesn't matter, all the evidence you need is on the screen. Cringey dialogue, choppy editing and pacing, revolting amounts of needless exposition, action and plot progression akin to that of a kid playing with his action men. This film is a masterpiece of failure that lacks so much identity and focus that it's doesn't even have a story. We never actually grasp what the point to anything is. Why are they even brought together in the first place? You'd at least expect the reason to be something that forces the governments hand, but actually, the evil force they end up fighting only comes about through the incompetence of the idea in the first place. Then there's the painting you're trying to sell to the audience. What are we trying to learn from the bringing together of these characters? Even bad people can come together and fight for redeemable things? Even bad guys are fighting for something? You can control bad guys to do what you want? They actually just bring all three of these together, and it's a disaster. All of these characters become something we're supposed to feel sympathy for. But they also continously do things randomly as if they keep forgetting these guys are meant to be villains. Plus, CONTINOUSLY, despite insisting otherwise, the Suicide Squad goes against their handlers and fuck with them with no consequence. There's no consistency, no real hook established, none of the characters are convincing or redeemable. It sucks. The twenty fucking minute long introduction to each and every character was one of the most incompetent filmmaking decisions I've seen from a Hollywood production. Twenty minutes. With each character getting 4-5 flashback scenes. All the while, Viola Davis is just sat at a table reading the synopsis for each fucking character. Excruciating, but at least they're giving some thought for that 99% of DC fans. aka the clinically diagnosed doorknobs. The only reason this isn't lower is, usually I'd reserve half a star for films I found to be insulting or revolting in some way. It's somewhat insulting intellectually, just not enough for me to consider it worthless. Plus, it gets an extra half star for having some 'okay' performances. Margot Robbie was a servicable Harley Quinn. Will Smith didn't do THAT bad. I'd also say, to protect David Ayer a little bit. This is a total studio disaster. I don't think much of this can be put onto his shoulders. If this film wasn't given to the studio that edited the trailer, maybe they could have at least salvaged this film to becoming passable.
This is borderline experimental.
A higher degree of bobbins than you find in most films of its ilk, but at least it didn't bore / annoy me like BvS / JL.
Fuck this movie.
I thought this was a Marvel movie (oeps)
Suicide Squad had me going nearly the entire movie. It's full of missed opportunities and wacky shit. Diablo was cool, Will Smith is always cool, and Harley Quinn stole the show. From Will Smith. She stole the show from Will Smith.
This film could’ve tackled much more material, much of what they were missing. It was a mess from the very beginning. That’s not necessarily saying it was god awful but sure as hell isn’t eveyone’s favorite. I like the vision that the director was going for but I feel like he was confused as to if he wanted to make it dark as fuck or simply a comedic event from minute one to the final minute. It’s gotta be one or the other and he didn’t know. As for the characters, alright .....um, what the fuck or what the FUCK? Harley? He got it right with choosing Margot Robbie, she gave the character a sassy yet “not giving a fuck” attitude which fit well. The tone of it all. As for the rest, eh, I mean, they tried I guess? Except I can’t judge Leto’s joker, mainly because he didn’t have lots of screen time which is understandable because of the fact that he ...isn’t apart of this story in particular. Nonetheless, this film needs its help. Lots of it.
Messy film has the quality of a trailer. The cinematography tries too hard to boast a crazy antihero flick feel and ends up failing. It’s only strength is in its characters.
Lol what?
“What are we? Some kind of Suicide Squad?”
Pulled from Twitter: Revisiting it again HANDS DOWN the worst DCEU film. Aside from some decent performances, this film leaves an ugly after-taste. But for archival purposes here is my OG review: #SuicideSquad is not as abysmal as the reviews suggest. BUT... it ain't good. Definitely a big disappointment. The 1st act when we're introduced to all the characters I thought was going fine. I surprisingly liked Will Smith as Deadshot. In fact the cast all around (except ONE guy in which we'll get to) is pretty spot on in their roles. @MargotRobbie oozes charisma. One last positive I'll say is that despite the VERY bad editing, the movie didn't indulge itself in a 2 & 1/2 hour runtime like BvS did. Now.... let's talk about the bullshit. Firstly, Jared Leto SUCKED as the Joker. Easily the worst interpretation I've seen to date. So the much hyped BTS drama the actor stirred led to a performance that's on par with Eddie Redmayne from Jupiter Ascending. I'll go more into the Joker himself later but needless to say this is an insult to Mark Hamill, Heath Ledger, Jack Nicholson, & Cesar Romero The REAL villains of the film are some of the worst I've seen to date. And that's saying A LOT b/c we just had Lex & Doomsday from BvS. Amanda Waller wants to combat Metahumans with other Metahumans. But aside from Diablo, NONE of them have actual superpowers. -____- The threat that was faced in this movie didn't lend towards the needs of non-powered villains. Batman & Wonder Woman could do it for you. There's a REALLY good animated DC film called #BatmanAssaultOnArkham which is what the live-action Suicide Squad film should have been. I mention this movie b/c it highlights the BIGGEST problem with David Ayer's film. The development of the Squad characters themselves In Assault on Arkham they are villains through & through. It's only b/c of Amanda Waller the Squad BARELY get along & do a good deed. In Ayer's film, they are made to be more sympathetic & even have a comradery which defeats the whole purpose of this concept of VILLAINS.
harley quinn saved this movie
I've certainly seen worse movies but I guess if Warner wants to spend $175,000,000 on a bunch of licensed songs they can. I hated Will Smith in this movie. Also nothing fucking happened in the entire movie. I'd say it was anti-climactic but it was anti-rising actionic. The whole movie was exposition and then they kinda just killed some monster. Wish I knew the motivations of the leader woman because she's shady and just randomly shot some FBI dudes???? Whatever, man. Also where was the Bohemian Rhapsody car scene from the trailer??? Did they just cut everything from this movie out? 2.5/5 Probably never going to watch more than the first half hour of this movie again.
Mostly good characters, great OST, but lame villain and plot. Maybe a good sequel?
Yet another example of a studio not knowing what they want there movie to be. All the best moments are in the trailers, and half don't make it to the final cut! The narrative is incredibly choppy, the tone(s) feels extremely messy, the scenes mix like water and vinegar, and themes like honor among thieves or the levels of villainy are never explored beyond face value. Going back and changing your mind is fine when you're planning an outfit, but not for making a movie. To be fair, some of the characters are able to do their comic source's justice despite limited screen time. Of course Smith is pretty much doing his usual thing but with a bit more sass, but he's always enjoyable. Robbie, Courtney, Hernandez and especially Davis truly brought their characters from the comics to the screen seamlessly, whereas Leto deserves all the flack he gets for that awful turn as The Joker.
there are so many good actors in this movie. every time I saw one I was like "why are you doing this". also can we stop romanticising abuse ty
very funny but not intentionally
“How did they ever make a movie of Lolita?” The tagline on the poster says it all. The answer to that question is that they didn’t, not really, and that’s for the best. The events of the 1955 Vladimir Nabokov novel are unfilmable as is, not only by 2018 standards, or even by 1962 standards, but really by any standards of decency and morality at all. It’s a film about pedophilia, the protagonist of which is an unrepentant sexual predator. It’s a film that I would hesitate to say is worth watching, but I’ve seen it twice now — once in a film class and again now. I doubt I’ll watch it again. Lolita is an interesting film for a few reasons. First, Stanley Kubrick is one of the greatest directors in the history of cinema. As such, it’s a well-made film, as repugnant as the subject matter may be. Second, the Hays Code sets suggestions of social mores aside and outright prohibits the depiction of many of the events of the novel. A film of that period couldn’t depict sex outside of marriage in a way that made it seem acceptable or arousing, and it had specific points about the seduction of girls, underage or not. For better or worse, Kubrick persevered. Kubrick finds ways to eroticize the relationship between Humbert and Lolita, opening on a closeup shot of her feet as her toenails are being painted by her stepfather, or having the camera leer at her as she sunbathes the first time Humbert sees her, underscored by that bubbly, playful pop theme. Naturally, the film is replete with editing ellipses to avoid depicting the more graphic elements of the story, but the nature of their relationship is far from ambiguous. James Mason gives a great performance as Humbert Humbert, and he looks intensely uncomfortable in nearly every scene (as he should), but especially those where he has to interact with people in his age group. Sue Lyon gives a performance on the level of any of the veteran actors in the film, and Peter Sellers is as much himself as ever, his performance bordering on annoyingly manic. Nothing is really clear about Kubrick’s intentions here. The film doesn’t seem to endorse Humbert’s actions in any way. After all, Lolita seems much happier without him, and both of her abusers end up dead. She survives the film, whereas she dies in the novel. However, depiction in itself can be a kind of endorsement through the mere act of choosing something to depict. Kubrick must have had a reason to make this film, and assuming that both he and Nabokov weren’t sexual predators, it’s still hard to guess what that reason might be. In framing their as one of tragically unrequited love, is Kubrick attempting to show how relationships can become abusive by depicting one that’s morally reprehensible from the outset? Is he attempting to illuminate how predators groom their victims, often by ingratiating themselves to the family? Or is he just taking a popular, controversial novel and adapting it because he felt like it would increase his stature? All of those are as equally plausible as not, and there are far too many films not about pedophilia for me to dig deeper to find out.
"Didn't you have a daughter with a lovely name?" Characters (6/10): They are okay but not very deep. It also not very clear why the protagonist is fascinated with Lolita. Story (5/10): The execution of the plot is good but the plot itself is not that interesting. Music (6/10): It does the job. Visuals (9/10): It looks good. I especially like the long shots. Enjoyment: 5/10 Overall: 6/10
LOLita? More like LMAOlita! But ya really creepy shit. James Mason is amason.
Many times, a film’s reputation will proceed it to a point of overwhelming any potential of interest it may have. The case with Lolita isn’t so much built up in terms of quality, but in the risqué nature of its material. The 60s were a time of considerable change in America, primarily in regards to sexuality. There was also a great upheaval of the Hollywood system, allowing filmmakers to tackle racier subjects. Lolita is one of the first films from this time to deal with the idea of a May-December romance, but unfortunately was still largely restricted by the powers still at hand. The film suffers a great deal from only being able to imply a lot of the feelings between its characters, though many great screenwriters have managed to find their way around these obstacles to extreme success for many decades prior. Even if one were to ignore the issue of the inability to communicate ideas subtly the film still manages to confuse and improperly communicate its main draw: the various relationships that are the center of the film. This is a romance film, a decidedly skeptical one yes, but a romance film all the same. The feelings Lolita and Humbert have for one another off and on throughout the film is rarely convincing, only made worse by the lack of straightforward dialogue. The film is also filled out by some benign characters who only add to the excruciating runtime of the film, with the only one of note being played by Peter Sellers, who somehow provides both the most entertaining and most frustrating moments of the film. There is still good in the film. For one thing, the black and white cinematography looks great, and the lead performance by James Mason is surely the best in the whole film. Shelly Winters also gives a fantastic performance here, but departs far too early and the film ceases to recover from her absence. Kubrick manages to flex his authorial voice here considerably more than his previous picture, Spartacus, but even with how simplistic and straightforward that film felt it was still more entertaining and stimulating, while also managing to justify its excessive runtime. The same cannot be said for Lolita, even when considering its boundary-pushing commentary on taboo relationships, which several other films throughout the decade would tackle better than Kubrick did here.
The first time I watched this I was in 4th or 5th grade. I was at my grandparents house one weekend and I woke up at like 5 or 6 in the morning to watch it on TCM. I wish I could talk to myself back then and ask what I got out of it. I think I understood the emotional journey if not the societal implications. Anyways, watching it as an adult is different.
Read the book before waching this movie! Kubick's Lolita is as addictive as Nabokov's work. Starting with the end of the novel the story reflects partially the book one because some parts have been cut and the ending has been invented. Although they both are works pretty different, Kubrick perfectly tells us the crazy and maniac love of Humbert Humbert for his Lolita.
A dark and twisted tale of a mind's disturbing obsession of a girl as they both use and decit one another. What I find most intriguing of this film is the use of light, happy orchestral themes within this very warped sense of love and commitment, with a around great cast particularly James Manson slow disarray of entitlement and passion and his cracks of insanity around Lolita.
Very engaging throughout the entire film. I did not feel like it was wasting my time - the pacing was slow but thoughtful. The film was at its best when the subtle differences between Lolita and her father were explored such as when they are talking in the car. The twist was clear throughout the entirety of the film, making it feel a little superfluous however this did not detract from a thoroughly enjoyable experience.
Think it may be my least favourite Kubrick film so far. That's not to say it's a bad film, it just didn't sit with me. I think my biggest issue is not really having a hook to latch onto anywhere. I didn't care for Humbert as a character or even his relationship with Lolita. Admittedly I will say I think Sue Lyon is superb as Lolita, probably the best performance in the entire film. And there's some great cinematography peppered throughout. Also strangely comedic in places. Bizarre seeing Kubrick do his own take on slapstick with the cot scene. But honestly the film falls flat for me. It doesn't help that it's two and a half hours long. It really felt like it.
I read Lolita almost exactly a year ago, which means I had enough distance from it, more or less, to approach the film on its own merits. On the other hand, the book created such a strong impression on me that little of it has faded in a year's time, so I can't quite describe myself as an objective observer. It's entirely possible that I would've gotten less out of this if I hadn't read the text. In any case, I loved this far more than I thought I would. Based on its reputation as a piece of work heavily compromised by the censorship of the time, I went in with rather measured expectations, all of which were exceeded. Honestly, the final product doesn't feel very compromised; yes, it's a bit less explicit about things every now and then, but Nabokov was never gratuitous about his subject matter in the first place, and Kubrick's ingenious approach to this material is to play it just like a normal Hollywood movie from the era of the Hayes code, complete with (gorgeous) black and white and a sweeping (also gorgeous) musical score, as if blithely ignorant of the perversity of what he's portraying. The first hour or so, in particular, is just excellent, a funhouse mirror screwball comedy only slightly more fast-paced, laden with innuendo,* and demented than, say, Bringing Up Baby or His Girl Friday. Shelley Winters plays the same character she always plays, but dials it up to 11, and the result is glorious; James Mason is brilliant as ever, in a role that finally (along with Bigger Than Life) gives his talents the showcase they deserve. The second hour of the film loses some of that energy, and not all of the digressions involving Peter Sellers' character are so compelling, but the film fully regains its power by the last half hour. If Lolita starts off as a parody of the American cinema of the '30s and '40s, it ends with a terribly sad slow-motion disintegration into alienation and loneliness that recalls the best cinema of the decades that followed. *CHARLOTTE: "Hum, you just touch me and I... I go as limp as a noodle. It scares me." HUMBERT: "Yes, I know the feeling."
So much is lost in translation. Almost worth it just to hear the music of Sellers’ and Mason’s voices.
So, first things first, this is a movie where the protagonist is a paedophile. So obviously that was uncomfortable. A friend of mine and I are working through Kubrick films and this was our fourth. We're watching them chronologically to see Kubricks development. This is clearly when he comes into his own voice which was obviously messed up but skilled in an unparalleled way. The last movie we watched, Spartacus, was a fascinating movie but it lacked the compelling characters of Paths of Glory and The Killing. Spartacus had some of the shots and theatrical excellence of Lolita though. Lolita's opening scene is the last chronologically, an excellent move when used correctly as it was here. Peter Sellers shined as the insanely creepy and unstable actor and play write. And in the opening scene his eccentricity is chilling, reading Humpherts poem and groveling in the emptiness of everything that is his life. The opening scene kept playing in my mind throughout the movie which is I think how it was intended. Kubrick managed to make you sympathise strongly with Humphert even tho you also knew how depraved and perverted he was. Even in the second half as he's beginning to crumble, there's still a place in your heart that wants everything to work out for him. This is a seminal movie in the way Kubrick challenged the norms and in some ways I think institutional censorship in art is dangerous. Good ideas don't need to be protected. But exploitation of the people portraying characters is an important point to consider. All things considered I thought Kubricks use of off-screen techniques was appropriate but the clear sexual innuendos maybe revealed a little too much levity. All in all a fascinating watch
Lolita Mixed bag. Wasn’t expecting it to be as funny. Although it’s uncomfortable to empathise with the heartbreak, I still managed to. Overall, it definitely succeeds in making me feel very sick.
I can see why Lolita is considered among Kubrick's minor works. Too washed out by censorship, the relationship between Humbert and Lolita it's not portrait very well, i can't feel the chemistry between them. Humbert motifs aren't clear as well. The final is kind of unsatiscatory. I think that the 1997 Lolita deals with this themes way better. However, is not afwul. I just saying that there is a lot of things to improve to reach the level of the novel.
I was really surprised by this one. I was expecting to be disgusted or revolted by its premise but, if you go in with the knowledge that he's a pedophile, the film serves as a sort of cautionary tale. The first half is even an unexpectedly funny and twisted dark comedy about marrying the wife to get to the daughter, but things turn dark in the second half and Humbert gets his deserved comeuppance. This may well be Kubrick's best or at least most classically directed film. His framing and shot choices are spot on and, though it is long, he really only overindulges when it comes to Peter Sellers' (admittedly hilarious) performance. The comedic undertones of the first half and deep-seated suspense of the second combine so well that it would even make Hitchcock proud.
"Underwhelmed" to say the least. The three previous films on Kubrick's filmography have all been between "very good" and "masterpiece". And this was the first one I ended up "meh", to be honest, I was very much bored through out the film. The film does show a rather disturbing subject without being completely explicit about it, which makes sense, but I was never invested in any of the characters making it hard for me to get chock or emotion out of me when the creepy stuff actually started, because I simply didn't care. Shows sickness, obsession and manipulation in a rather on the nose way, I got the paralels between mother and child and saw a few moments towards the end that showed how the tables have turned on this two main characters, but nothing that interesting, on my view. The performances aren't great, the tone is mildly irritating, the cinematography is always competent but much less impressive than other works from Kubrick and the whole story itself felt a normal "manipulating wife and crazy husband" kind of story, with the twist being a child. Sure, its sick, but felt very bland after a while.
not my favorite Kubrick at all but not terrible
It's makes much more sense hearing that Kubrick admits at the time that he didn't know what the real themes of the Nobokov book and that if he did he wouldn't have made it. It's well made and Peter Sellers gives a great performance as always, but everything else is just so clearly misguided in it's attempts to adapt the source material.
Pedophilia, He Wrote
Lolita, for me, is one of Kubrick’s weaker films. It has good acting and Kubrick is making his mark, for sure. But this movie had so many boring scenes by the end and it drags.
The main plot is very risque, at times leading it to be an uneasy watch, but I suppose that was the intention. Lolita was nevertheless exhilarating, captivating, at times darkly hilarious, which is something I have come to appreciate in Stanley Kubrick's film that I've seen. The entire cast give some of the best screen acting performances I have ever seen, bringing this preposterous story to life and giving it so much verisimilitude. While the leads are absolutely spellbinding, I found the supporting cast to be equally magnificent, especially Peter Sellers, whom I was delighted to see again after enjoying his roles in Dr Strangelove, which he and Kubrick would collaborate on two years after this. Despite the film occasionally feeling its length, I would say that it is the most I have been entertained by one of Kubricks films. Though I have not yet seen all of them, Lolita is the one that invested me the most so far, and it's largely down to the performances as I have mentioned. The dynamic between Lolita and Humbert could suggest many things, and I felt that there was a great air of mystery around what they were thinking throughout, trying to decipher just how stable Humbert really is despite his elegant outer nature, and if Lolita had any agendas of her own. It may not be held in the same high status as Kubricks other films, and that is partially why I was drawn to this film, but I found it to be quite great, and is definitely worth checking out if you haven't already.
This is not true in letter nor in spirit to Nabokov’s novel, which I’d consider my favorite novel of all-time, but in a way, Stanley Kubrick’s ability to a turn a novel as disturbing as Lolita into a hilarious and tragic satire is its own equally valid stroke of genius. The nature of the relationship between Lolita and Humbert Humbert is obviously censored, but Kubrick presents their scenes together in a manner that openly subverts the visual language of Hollywood romances. The film is at its most thrilling in confusingly intimate two-shots of James Mason and Sue Lyon, or in moments of heartbreak scored by the film’s surprisingly beautiful main theme. As director, Kubrick is constantly toeing the line between mocking his characters and empathizing with them in a way that I find rewarding as a spectator. Shelley Winters’ performance, a mad mixture of desperation and heartbreak, is a great indicator of what Kubrick is going for here - she’s hilarious, and despite how over-the-top her character may be, a bit of humanity shines through. I’m less sure about how the film utilizes the character of Clare Quilty, played by Peter Sellers, who awkwardly follows Lolita and Humbert around in a way that never feels truly necessary. Sellers is obviously one of the greatest comic actors of all-time, but sometimes he takes these big swings and they don’t really work for me - this is one of those times. The film not only obscures the details of Humbert and Lolita’s affair, but it also softens how horrible, evil, and manipulative Humbert Humbert is; I think that makes it challenging to watch in the same way that Humbert’s unreliable narration makes the novel challenging to read. In the midst of Humbert and Lolita’s domestic squabbles, you forget about Humbert’s unwavering depravity. I think that helps to make it a successful satire on human nature and the codified distractions of everyday American life.
maybe i'm biased because i'm a huge fan of the book, but i did not enjoy Kubrick's film much at all. the novel succeeds because you are implanted in HH's head, and the film loses so much bite as it tries to tell the story in a more traditional way. the novel had a manic energy & pace to it that James Mason's performance in no way replicates -- i'm sure i'm not alone in thinking Peter Sellers would be 100x better in the role of HH.
While the playful tone may be at odds with the subject matter, Kubrick manages to pull it off.
Yea even Kubrick can’t do the book justice
The best I can say is at least it’s not Batman and robin
Chris O'Donnell as Robin helped me realize my sexuality and that should be enough to give this 5 stars. but it's not a good movie, which is a shame
So Batman Forever was Joel Schumacher’s first sorry attempt at a Batman movie. And man did he screw it up! This film took everything that made the 1989 Batman so great, and threw it out the freakin window! He did the same thing that Brett Ratner did with X Men the Last Stand. He replaced good drama and character arcs, with absurd gadgets and gizmos, and campy as heck villains. And when I mean campy, I mean 1966 campy. I mean you got Jim Carry playing the Riddler, what could you expect. This film is definitely not as bad as Batman and Robin. But is is still a far cry from what Batman was, and has become.
A big guilty pleasure of mine tbh 😂
Sit down kids, and let me take you back to that olde timey year, 1995...this was actually the #1 movie that year, the theater was packed when I saw it, and remember, this was before stadium seating, so you got all up in each other's armrests! I was disappointed Keaton left with Burton, but this was pretty fresh at the time. I still listen to my soundtrack CD, it's still great. Kilmer is so subdued, as both Bats and Bruce. Tommy Lee Jones almost explodes his own head attempting to out-ham Jim Carrey. Jones goes too far, Carrey is perfect. Kidman never disappoints, ever. After so many newer and darker versions since, it's only natural to look at this as cheesy, but it's one of the best Batman movies we've got.
The only good Batman movie
Hate to say it but any movie with him Carrey I have to watch. It's bad but he makes it work. It does help that Jones was having fun every day on set.
God this movie is dumb, but damnit it's fun and silly. Michael Keaton is sorely missed as is Tim Burton and the seriousness of the previous films. It's pretty obvious within the first 10 minutes Warner Brothers kicked Tim Burton and his script to the side. If this film doesn't completely offend you as a Batman fan, it's actually so dumb and silly and the performances are so over the top its enjoyable at times. Jim Carrey is basically playing the Mask again with riddles. I mean it's Jim Carrey in the 90s what more do expect. Val Kilmer is a terrible Batman with awful lines, but he's not a bad Bruce Wayne. I think with better writing and less mouth breathing on his part he could have been a decent Batman/Bruce Wayne combo. Chris O'Donnell is an over the top gooft Robin and fits in with this stupidly goofy movie. The fact they tryed to make this 25 year old at the time pass as a teenager is hilarious. Lastly on to the biggest dumbest overacted garbage performance in this entire film. Tommy Lee Jones as Two Face. Where the hell do I start, I feel like Jones watched the 89 Batman film and pretty much just based his entire performance on that movies Joker. To put it bluntly his is the worst and best thing in this movie. He and Carrey are so over the top that you can't help but laugh at the stupidity and that pretty much describes this film you can help but like the stupidity and thats why it was able to squeeze out a 1 and half star. If you see this movie cool if not your not missing much. If you do decide to watch this movie slam a few adult beverages before to increase your enjoyment. PS. O yeah Nicole Kidman is in this movie don't worry 2 days after you'll forget too.
BATMAN FOREVER (1995) "Batman must battle former district attorney Harvey Dent, who is now Two-Face and Edward Nygma, The Riddler with help from an amorous psychologist and a young circus acrobat who becomes his sidekick, Robin." I'm going to get this out of the way real quick so you understand fully where this review is going: I hate this sad excuse of a Batman flick! The third installment in the initial Batman film series finds the caped crusader, now played by Val Kilmer, battling Two-Face (portrayed by Tommy Lee Jones) and The Riddler (portrayed by Jim Carrey), with the aid of Robin (portrayed by Chris O'Donnell). Batman attempts to thwart the evil scheme concocted by The Riddler and Two-Face to extract all information from the minds of Gotham's residents for unlimited knowledge and control. Okay, time to rip these red flags to shreds: the acting by everyone involved is surprisingly bad (save for Nicole Kidman ironically), with some cringeworthy bits of dialogue being delivered at inappropriate times ("I'M BATMAN!"_Bruce Wayne during the circus incident). Val Kilmer is terribly cast, and I'm sorry, Jim Carrey was so over the top and whimsical, he would've been better suited playing The Joker. Speaking of The Riddler, who the Hell thought it a keen idea to make him resemble Gozer The Destructor from Ghostbusters (1984) in the anticlimactic ending?! Why does Two-Face look like half his face (the burned part that looks like chewed bubblegum) got dipped in Pepto Bismal?! Why is Robin a full grown adult?! What the fuck is with Batman's suit having rubber nipples and those ominous close-up ass shots from the cinematographer?! Ugh!!! The action sequences are trash, the humor stupid and unfunny, the set designs are now clunky and ugly looking, the musical score is second-rate, and the tone just bleh overall. The movie's plot is absolute garbage and the movie has severe dry patches of boringness. Joel Schumacher, what were you smoking, bro?! I will say this though! The movie has a couple of noteworthy positives worth mentioning. I liked the look of the Batmobile in this; it's flashy and fancy and fast! Nicole Kidman, as mentioned earlier, is the only good actress in this movie, even if her character lacks any development. A smidget of the effects are good to gawk at. And really...that's about it. Guys, I'm sorry, but this movie really sucks. It should've been retitled 'Batman Never.'
My first full viewing of this & I don’t give a shit about the nipples on the suits, I just think Jim Carrey fucking sucks.   Nice to see Nicole Kidman having fun as the psychiatrist that’s super horny for Batman.
Oh you minx, you saucy seductress Batman Forever. You movie that I alternately mildly enjoy and hate. You movie that should have been so much more, who’s parts are so much greater than its sum. You a terrific Batman/Bruce Wayne in Kilmer, a rockin’ Batmobile, Nicole Kidman as a dream doctor whomhas a thing for bats (get it?), Jim Carrey as a perfect goofball of a Fiddler, and flippin’ Tommy Lee Jones! What can you go wrong with all of this in place? So much. So, so much. You can bring in a seventy year old Robin (who apparently dries his clothes with karate and a mop). You can decide the best way to portray the epic hardness of the street gangs by painting all of their faces with neon glow in the dark face paint. You can strip Tommy Lee Jones of any dignity in his role and make him a thankless sidekick to Jim Carey’s brilliant Riddle. Instead of having them face off against one another upping each others game you push him into the background allowing him to get lost in the in the carnival playing out on screen. Let’s get one thing straight, Kilmer makes a great Batman. He is what elevates this movie above what would go on to become Batman and Robin. And while that rumored onset fight may have kept us from having a great Batman to populate what may have been a series of ever more embarrassing Batman films, it is also so very comforting to know that Batman punched (shoved) the guy destroying his on screen legacy all while in the Bat-suit (maybe?). I cannot decide how I feel about this particular movie, it is something I have struggled with for years. I want it to be so much better than it is. I see a better movie hiding underneath all ohm he trash piled on top of it, just bursting to get out. (Keaton was smart and did.) For years I clung to an answer to how this could be almost good, and it was a brief little credit over the bank vault at the beginning of the film Executive Producer: Tim Burton. I don’t know how much influence he actually had over the final film (he had prepped for a third before he was removed from the directors chair), but I still (must) believe that his voice was still, even if ever so faintly, heard. I have never seen a Schumacher film I liked, this is the closest I have ever come.
This is a lackluster Batman film that has barely any entertainment value. Val Kilmer has one of the least memorable Batman performances and Nicole Kidman is too good for this role, which is a statement I can make for the rest of the cast, while Tommy Lee Jones has one of the worst performances in the entirety of the Batman series.
BATMAN FOREVER (PG) D: Joel Schumacher Warner Bros. (Tim Burton & Peter Macgregor-Scott) 🇺🇸 1995 121 mins Action/Adventure/Fantasy W: Lee Batchler, Janet Scott Batchler & Akiva Goldsman [based on characters created by Bob Kane] DP: Stephen Goldblatt Ed: Dennis Virkler Mus: Elliott Goldenthal PD: Barbara Ling Val Kilmer (Bruce Wayne/Batman), Tommy Lee Jones (Harvey Dent/Two Face), Jim Carrey (Edward Nygma/The Riddler), Nicole Kidman (Dr. Chase Meridian), Chris O'Donnell (Dick Grayson/Robin), Michael Gough (Alfred), Pat Hingle (Commissioner Gordon) Some odious, money-minded studio executive clearly must have thought that the previous two Batman films were far too dark for children, so decided that there'd be all change and the result is something so camp that the 1960's TV show would blush in embarrassment. Joel Schumacher replaces Tim Burton as director, Val "It's the car right? Chicks love the car" Kilmer steps in as Batman and Gotham City is replaced by some kind of circus. Chris O'Donnell joins Batman's side as the incredibly obnoxious Robin as they battle criminals Two Face, poorly portrayed by Tommy Lee Jones, and The Riddler (Jim Carrey's madcap performance is probably the only good thing about this film). All the set pieces are pale imitations of those from the Tim Burton movies and the screenplay is simply pathetic! "Holy rusted metal, Batman!"? Bollocks!! 4/10
“Nice form little rough on the landing, he may have to settle for the bronze”  Jim Carrey and tommy lee jones sort of saved this movie. Without them there wouldn’t really be anything else to appreciate. Because besides them this film kind of sucks.
The Riddler has grown on me. He has cool stuff at his house.
It may be the first Batman film I saw in theatres, but the villains make the Adam West series look somber, and Bruce Wayne forgot the night his parents died? Holy rusted metal Batman!
if jim carrey could read my mind he would know how much i love him
You guys ready to hate me?  I’m about to GO IN and rate a ton of movies I’ve seen but not logged- and will potentially never watch again. If I have any thoughts on the film, I will put them here:  Sorry for the spam!
Controvercial opinion time: This is my favourite Batman film so far of my Batman Movie watch through. This has it all, it's got action, it's got a bit of comedy, it's got the darkness of Batman and the sarcasm, and it's even got Robin now too! It's great, I loved it! Also I didn't twig that Robin was played by Chris O'Donnell, he doesn't look anything like the older version I know from NCIS:LA. Instead I was watching thinking he Must have been related to Stephen Amell, like an older brother or a cousin or something. But no!
A solid goofy fun popcorn Batman movie that has a great cast , whenever i watch this movie it brings back nostalgic feelings , oh and it has one of my favorite movie title songs ever , kiss from a rose by Seal !
A guilty pleasure movie. So bad it’s good.
As bad as this movie is direction and storytelling wise... I really enjoy all of the villains-- the actors did a great job, and the costume and set design is a lot more colorful than you'd expect in a batman film and I love it
I couldn’t remember if I walked out of this movie before it finished back in 1995, but I know I hated this film. After recently reading an article on the making of it, I had forgotten how many awesome actors are in it. I decided to give it another look 23 years later. While I still hate it, it wasn’t as bad as I remember. However, Tommy Lee Jones was atrocious and the directing was some of the worst I’d seen, terrible camera moves, horrible ADR and don’t get me started on the second unit shots (Bat Bum anyone?!)
The only good thing about this movie was Jim Carrey’s portrayal of The Riddler.
Once again, I watched this a lot on VHS
I watched this movie (and the other three Batman films in this series) all for the first time earlier this year. In fact, I watched this and Batman & Robin one right after the other on the same night (when I discovered they were leaving Netflix at the end of that week). I said this in my & Robin review, but I went into these last two expecting irredeemable garbage, and what I actually got was at worst a middling superhero story with highly stylized production design and a few genuine laughs. I think I liked & Robin a little more than this because I liked its villains more - Jim Carrey in particular got on my nerves in this movie. I also wasn't as sold on Val Kilmer as Batman as I was George Clooney or Michael Keaton - he wasn't bad but he didn't seem to bring much of a personal touch to the role. I generally liked these movies, though, enough that I'd even watch them again at some point. I think they'd be fun to watch with a friend and poke fun at. I certainly don't think they're the abysmal insults to the art of cinema that RottenTomatoes and IMDB seem to think they are. I guess people take their portrayals of Batman pretty personally, but for all the Long Halloween and Year One comics in his storyline, there are also a lot of goofy silver age ones too. It's not as if the Adam West-led TV show wasn't true to the books in its own way. I think the success of the Nolan films shows us, though, that that wasn't the Batman people were looking to see in the movies, though. Oh well. I wouldn't mind some levity in the DC cinematic universe these days.
If I'm being honest with everyone here *gestures openly to a large room, holding only my mother, two dogs and a sleeping cat* this is my favorite Batman movie. You could say it's my power, my pleasure, my pain.
It’s one of those movies were it’s so bad that it’s good
Not that bad of a movie at all. More or less enjoyed it.
(Old impressions, not based on a recent viewing) At times surprisingly compelling, but the mismatch of drama and ridiculousness makes this a watchable mess with an odd appeal to it.
COURAGE NOW, TRUTH ALWAYS… I was surprised how much I like Jim carry as the Riddler, quite a unique take on the character. I love how they played out the ending with Enigma, such a perfect way to play out him giving away the identity of the Batman. Found it kind of silly how Chase went from wanting The Batman originally, then turning to Bruce instead, seemed a bit unnecessary. I also love the Robin in this, he suited the role really well.
I like them both
Yes, I know this is also a rather unorthodox choice for a Halloween marathon, but screw it, it has a scene that takes place during Halloween, so I say it counts. Besides, it makes perfect sense to revisit Nicole Kidman’s first foray into the DC Universe with Aquaman coming out later this year, doesn’t it? So here we are at last – Batman Forever. The one Batman movie that I had never seen in its entirety until now. And I’m not gonna beat around the bush, guys – out of all the live action Batman movies this is by far my least favorite. You can argue all you want that Batman & Robin is worse, but at least that movie had a more consistent tone, it committed to its campy batshit insanity and at least there was more of an awareness of what they were doing and the type of movie they were making. Joel Schumacher once said that everybody involved with Batman Forever was very reluctant to work on it and let me tell you, the behind-the-scenes problems are very evident in the final product. This is the most tonally confused DC movie I’ve seen pre-Justice League. Warner Bros. wanted to lighten things up and take the series in a more family friendly direction after Batman Returns, but the film still has some pretty dark and serious moments and it’s clear that Schumacher had a very hard time balancing those completely opposite elements, leading to some pretty jarring tonal shifts. Don’t misunderstand me – the scenes between Alfred and Bruce in Batman & Robin (AKA the best parts of it) also clashed with the overall campy and silly tone of the movie, but in hindsight, even they weren’t this jarring. Oh, and you just gotta love how the studio was constantly going on and on and on about how they were taking things in a more family friendly direction, yet they still allowed the early dialogue exchanges between Chase Meridian and Batman, a close-up of Batman’s ass and a Nicole Kidman panty shot. I’d really like to know how Schumacher blackmailed WB to let him keep the latter two in the final cut. And trust me, the uneven tone of this movie is the least of its problems, but before I move on, I’ll just like to take this moment to say that Batman Forever’s title sequence is hands down the worst in the franchise – the cast’s names flying out at us against a boring-ass black backdrop via effects that even Power Point presentations would laugh at. How fucking inspired. Say what you will about the other Batman movies, but they knew how to introduce their titles. The first Burton movie had the camera circling through a huge Batman logo. Batman Returns showed us the origin of the Penguin as the credits were rolling. And in both cases we had Danny Elfman’s epic Batman theme blaring in the background, perfectly complementing the visuals. Even Batman & Robin got this right! www.youtube.com/watch?v=xP4WLAeOpyM And now that I’ve made my point, let’s continue. The movie’s chaotic production is also reflected in its storytelling, which is really poor in some areas, more particularly with regard to some of the characters, especially Two-Face. Harvey Dent is one of the most tragic Batman villains of all time, so much so that his fall from grace and his transformation into Two-Face was a major central storyline in The Dark Knight and the brilliant way it was handled is one of the many reasons why that movie is held in such high regard. Sadly, Batman Forever not only glosses over this tragedy which can fill an entire movie on its own (or at the very least be an intricate part of a much larger storyline), reducing it to really clumsy exposition dumps, but it turns Two-Face into a complete joke. I am not exaggerating in the slightest when I say that he literally has no reason whatsoever to hate Batman in this movie. Batman wasn’t the one who threw acid in his face – it was a mob boss! Why doesn’t he hate and try to kill that mob boss?! Especially since that’s exactly what he did in the Batman: The Animated Series two-parter “Two-Face”. Why? Because the writers of that show can actually think logically. The only reason he fought Batman in those two episodes was because Batman kept getting in his way. Aside from that, his attention was focused entirely on the man who ruined his life. They also try to give Batman and Two-Face a connection in this movie and they fail miserably at it – towards the end Batman tells Two-Face that he was a good friend and it really doesn’t work because those two had zero connection in the previous two movies. Some people have actually tried to defend this, stating that Forever is actually a soft reboot, but this argument holds no weight because there are very overt references to the previous two movies and Pat Hingle and Michael Gough are still playing Commissioner Gordon and Alfred. But even taking that out of the equation, the connection between Batman and Two-Face that they so desperately try to push doesn’t work because we never saw them as friends. Compare that to Star Wars: A New Hope. In that film, Obi-Wan and Vader have only one scene together, but because of Obi-Wan’s earlier recounting of his tragic past experiences with Vader, you could feel the history and the connection between them, which is why their encounter is such an effective moment. On top of his total lack of motivation, Two-Face cannot even be considered a character because he is not a character – he’s a plot device. The only reason why he’s in this movie is to pave the way for a connection and a relationship that actually works, but we’ll get to that later. The rest of the time he’s mugging obnoxiously for the camera. Which brings me to the final reason this version of Two-Face doesn’t work – Tommy Lee Jones’ terrible performance. Jones is a great actor and he’s certainly had successful forays into the comic book movie genre (Men in Black, Captain America: The First Avenger), but here he is just embarrassing himself – so much so that I can’t even say I feel sorry for him. This guy actually had the balls to criticize Jim Carrey’s performance and call him a buffoon. Motherfucker, did you ever stop to consider how YOU looked from the sidelines while making this movie? Unlike you, Carrey was actually entertaining and his Riddler actually had a personality, but again, let’s not get ahead of ourselves. And that piece of shit makeup you’re wearing is certainly not helping your case. I love Rick Baker, but he must have been high as a kite when he created that makeup. Can’t say I blame him. Guys, say what you will about Arnold Schwarzenegger’s Mr. Freeze, but at least he was a fleshed out character with fleshed out and understandable motives and he actually went through an arc. OK, I’m done talking about Two-Face, let’s move on because we still have a lot of ground to cover. Next up, we have another very problematic character – Dr. Chase Meridian, played by Nicole Kidman. This has got to be the worst psychiatrist I’ve ever seen in a movie because throughout a good chunk of her screentime all she does is talk about how she wants to bang Batman. Also, what psychiatrist does boxing before sessions with her patients? And to top it all off, I just don’t feel any chemistry between her and Val Kilmer, which makes the moment when Bruce decides to quit being Batman so he can be with her that much more unbelievable. Are you kidding me? This horny chick with a major Bat-boner is the reason why Bruce decides to quit being Batman?! Not the death of the Graysons. Not the fact that he failed to save Harvey Dent from becoming Two-Face. Not some crippling injury. They do try to give an explanation, but it comes across as incredibly half-assed. The sad thing is, this character actually could’ve worked if they had made her a villain and called her Harleen Quinzel. Think about it – Chase Meridian is a psychiatrist who is obsessed with one of Gotham’s most famous loonies (because, come on, what sane person would fight crime dressed up as a giant bat?) and wants to write a book on said loony and even become romantically involved with him. That’s literally note for note Harley Quinn’s character and if they had gotten rid of Two-Face, renamed her to Harleen Quinzel and focused on her obsession with Batman leading her to become Harley Quinn, modeling herself after the Joker, we could’ve had something there. I mean, she’s gotta know about the Joker and the other villains Batman has fought (“Do I need skin-tight vinyl and a whip?”), but I digress. But by far the character who really got the shaft in this movie is Commissioner Gordon. Now, I can’t pretend this is something exclusive to this movie because he was also pretty ineffectual in the Burton films, but here they really cranked up his useless levels to 11, as he just lets Batman do his job for him almost all the time. It just feels like a waste of Pat Hingle’s talents and it makes me all the more thankful for the much better way that Christopher Nolan and Gary Oldman portrayed Gordon. And at this point you’re probably wondering if there’s even anything I liked about this movie. Well, yes – quite a few things, actually. For all its problems (and believe me, there are many more), the movie does have its fair share of redeeming qualities. First and foremost, The Riddler. What can I say – Jim Carrey is always a plus and he is as entertaining and funny as he’s ever been and the manic energy he brings to the character really helps elevate this movie. Edward Nygma is pretty much the type of obsessive fan that Stephen King wrote about in Misery. Carrey perfectly rides the line between funny and psychotic and you understand why Nygma hates Bruce Wayne. Not to mention that his plan – using mass media as a way to steal people’s knowledge and secrets – is brilliant and has become even more relevant as a commentary in this day and age. Next up, we have the second best character in the movie – Dick Grayson aka Robin. While Chris O’Donnell does look way too old to be a teenager, he still does a pretty good job in the role, making you feel the pain that Robin is going through after losing his entire family, leading to some really well done interactions and conversations between him and Bruce. They can actually relate to each other because they lost their parents in a very similar fashion. I also have to give costume designers Ingrid Ferrin and Bob Ringwood credit because the Robin costume actually looks pretty damn good. The only issue I have with Robin is the way he was captured by Two-Face, which I don’t buy for a second. I mean, seriously, he couldn’t have just knocked the gun out of Two-Face’s hand? Jeez, Robin, sometimes you really are a D-I-C-K. Despite my issues with Chase, Nicole Kidman does fine with the material she’s given. Val Kilmer is… OK as Batman, I guess, derpy Bat-smile notwithstanding. Nothing great, but nothing terrible. Like I said, his best scenes in this movie are with Dick and, to his credit, Val Kilmer does an admirable job portraying Bruce’s guilt for failing to save the Graysons as well as his psychological torment and PTSD. The extremely atmospheric way that Schumacher and DOP Stephen Goldblatt shot the death of the Waynes and Batman’s origin, is nothing short of breathtaking, especially that shot of the bat flying towards little Bruce. And last, but definitely not least, Michael Gough knocks it out of the park as Alfred once again. Production designer Barbara Ling also managed to craft some pretty impressive sets, especially Two-Face’s lair and Arkham Asylum, which looks really cool. It’s really sad when the lair of a villain has more character and personality than its master, but what can you do. Lastly, while I certainly understand why it’s not everybody’s cup of tea, I personally really enjoyed Elliot Goldenthal’s score. In conclusion, despite a few bright spots and a couple of well-adapted moments from the comics, Batman Forever is overall a mess, suffering from poorly developed characters, inconsistencies with the previous two movies, an uneven tone and some pretty cringe-worthy dialogue and moments. I know a lot of people really like it because it was their first introduction to Batman – and if that’s the case, more power to you, go ahead and enjoy it, there’s certainly a lot to like about it – but, as controversial as this may sound, in my opinion Batman & Robin is better. It’s not a good movie by any means, but it had more of an identity, it was more self-aware and at least it went all the way with its campy schlock. If Batman Forever is on TV, I might watch it, but I’d rather have a DVD/Blu-Ray player remote so I can fast-forward to the good moments. On the bright side, at least now we know why Ace Ventura hates bats. Next time, on the Halloween marathon, we go from DC to Marvel because it’s open season on all suckheads. Stay tuned.
The film that’s responsible for me being a Batman fan. No, it’s not a great film by any means but the 5 year old version of myself loved every moment of this movie. The adult version of myself can tolerate it. Personally I don’t believe it’s as bad as most people make it out to be.
Gotham is terrorized by unrelated psycho dweebs who call themselves Joker, Riddler, Two-Face, Penguin and Mister Freeze. Have you ever thought of moving, Bruce?
Underwhelming take on the caped crusader. Good scenery and energy, mediocre screenplay. 5/10
I think I'm the only person in the world to hate this more than Batman and Robin. Blame Jim Carrey.
Movie 2 of the worst batman series. Val Kimer is not my favorite batman but is better than Clooney, Jim Carey and Tommy Lee Jones are OK in this movie, neither are my favorite rendition of the character, but a close second. Batman forever is when they tried to appease the children and pushed to make money from action figures. That's why this movie is more of a cartoon and the characters seem more one dimensional.
Very different feel to it than the Tim Burton films. Characters and visuals much more extreme and supposed to be comical. Tommy Lee Jones and Jim Carrey both didn’t convince me as villains.
yeah, it's bad. yeah, riddler's bodysuit was so tight i was physically uncomfortable. yeah, there's a sexual innuendo every two seconds. but i'd be lying if i said i didn't have almost as good of a time as jim carrey obviously had filming it,,,, and this has some of the most interesting set/costumes design i've EVER seen (also nicole kidman... nghh 💕💕)
Batman Forever: Red Book Edition
Why is this so much more memorable and enjoyable than the hero flicks of the last decade or so? I think the Riddler lays it out pretty well in a quip to his partner in crime. "Your entrance was good, his was better. The difference? Showmanship."
The thing that annoys me the most about this movie now, is when Edward drives up to Wayne Manor, before transforming into The Riddler, and just places a big green envelope on the gates. So apparently Wayne Manor has no fucking security system set up to watch the perimeters? Batman doesn’t think he should guard his house? They would’ve filmed him coming up and solved this so quickly.  I blame Akiva Goldsman.
This movie gets a really bad wrap because it's directed by Joel Schumacher, who also made the awful Batman and Robin. But Batman Forever is actually pretty good. It has some of the campiness and cheesiness inspired by the 60s Batman show, but there are still enough serious moments and Tim Burton influence to make this movie enjoyable. The lighthearted elements mix with the darker moments really well. Tommy Lee Jones makes a pretty good two-face, Jim Carey is awesome as the Riddler, Val Kilmer is an underrated Batman and Nicole Kidman is great. It's also a great looking movie. The set and costume design blend the Gothic Burtonesque motifs with a brighter and more whimsical colour pallet to create some weird and unique scenery. Batman Forever is just fabulous.
Loud, garish and overacted, it's definitely a downgrade from the Tim Burton movies.
Surely no one can even argue against Riddler and Two Face being obvious gay lovers in this.
Wonder if we'll reach this level of wackiness in movies ever again
Robin: You don’t know what it’s like to have both of your parents murdered right in front of you  Batman: Yeah I do.
(This movie was watched as part of Super-Cember, in which I watched a different superhero movie I'd never seen before in the month of December 2017) You guys already know that Batman Returns is my favourite movie of the month so far. That's why, when I saw Batman Forever (1995) today, you can imagine I was severely disappointed. This is just not a good movie, though I can't exactly say it's a bad one either. Starring Val Kilmer as Bruce Wayne/Batman, Tommy Lee Jones as Harvey Dent/Two-Face, Jim Carrey as Edward Nygma/The Riddler, Nicole Kidman as Dr. Chase Meridian and Chris O'Donnell as Dick Grayson/Robin. Right from the first two lines, this movie felt off. It was clear this was targeted more at kids, and the tone is nowhere near as dark as Batman Returns. Despite this, the movie tries to continue the story of Bruce attempting to remember about his parents' death, and there a lot of great atmospheric scenes that really don't fit the overall tone of the movie. It's almost like the first draft was a darker movie like the previous, but then through either the studio's intervention or just lazy rewrites, we got the lighter tone. It's a messy movie in that sense, and I couldn't really take it seriously. Even the sets look ridiculous. I have no idea when Gotham decided to build statues taller than the buildings themselves, but they should stop that. Val Kilmer replaces Michael Keaton from the previous movies and he does his best. It doesn't really help that Bruce Wayne and Batman are barely given anything to do, and Kilmer definitely isn't as good in the role as Keaton was. Chris O'Donnell debuts as Dick Grayson, and I like aspects of his performance. When his characters not make stupid-ass decisions like taking the Batmobile out for a spin, I really liked his character. They did a great job of establishing his origins, and he has a very believable struggle with Bruce throughout the film. Nicole Kidman has been the least impressive of the love interests. She tries her best in her performance, but the character is beyond boring. We're introduced to her as being in love with Batman just because she is, and then once she finally gets Batman, she turns him down for Bruce just because she does. There's no clear motivations for why she does the things she does, and we don't even get the benefit of any Pfeiffer-esque freakouts to entertain us in the meantime. You can tell she's bored in this movie, and it's such a waste of Nicole Kidman. The only really fun and entertaining things about this movie are its villains. Don't get me wrong, they don't come close to Nicholson, Walken, Pfeiffer or Devito, but you can tell these two are really having fun here, and they lavish in every second of screen-time they get. Tommy Lee Jones plays Two-Face, which is a weird cast change after getting Billy Dee Williams for the first movie. His performance is fine, but we really would have benefited from seeing who Harvey Dent was before the accident that made him insane. Something as simple as that would have really gone a long way here. Also, his makeup is very noticeable, and it doesn't really look like acid burns at all. Just another thing that took me out of the experience. But the gold medal here goes to Jim Carrey as the Riddler. True, he's really just playing Jim Carrey in this movie, but it's so very entertaining. Every time he's on screen, he steals the show, and you can tell he's really enjoying himself in this film. Yes, his motivations are extremely flimsy, and his turn to villain was one of the most sudden and forced things I've ever seen in a comic-book movie, and as far as evil schemes go, this is tame in comparison to the villains of the previous films, but I'm sorry, Carrey is just so fun to watch. It's like he knew how much of a joke the character was, so he made his whole performance into the joke, and it just works. If Jim Carrey was going to play any comic-book character, I'm glad it was the Riddler. Overall, Batman Forever (1995), was a boring movie that was thankfully redeemed somewhat by Jim Carrey. Such a drop in quality from the previous film, and I already know what a joke the next Batman film is, so I'm certainly not looking forward to watching that one in 6 days.
"Was that over the top? I can never tell."
The riddler was cool but nothing else was
This movie gets credit for some reason. I think just because it's good compared to Batman & Robin. But it's not good. It's bad. And I hate Tommy Lee Jones in it.
This is the first time seeing this, and I just didn’t enjoy it. I love Burton’s take on the Bat, but Shumacher’s is much less my style. Everything felt fake, including the set. In Burton’s, everything is overstylized, but it still feels gritty and lived in, whereas here everything feels sanitized and just plain boring. I surprisingly liked Jim Carey in this, and Nicole Kidman, but otherwise I wasn’t a big fan of the cast. This is my least favorite Batman so far, and I really didn’t like the introduction of Robin.
Nicole Kidman.
It's so long. Outside of the production design, this is a tough one. Jim Carry has some nice campy moments as Riddler but when it veers into the Jim Carrey persona it's too much. Poor Tommy Lee Jones. He's pretty good here but I feel gets overshadowed by Carrey. This movie is bad because the Chase/dream meaning subplot doesn't amount to anything. Character decisions are arbitrary and based entirely what the plot needs; go ahead and try to explain why and how the Bruce/Dick conflict gets resolved. The shot choices are really showy to help camp this thing up but it can be too much at times and just look really ugly. Young Chris o'Donnell though. Damn. I'm still into it, earring and all.
It doesn’t get any of the characters right and it honestly makes next to no sense but there isn’t a minute of it where you aren’t entertained by how utterly baffling it all is.
"Batman Forever" marks the start of the "dark days" of Batman, but there is still a lot of fun to be had. Kilmer is solid as the new Bruce Wayne, and Lee Jones & Carry are bonkers as Two-Face & Riddler. The absolute WORST aspect of the film is Robin.
You know, now that the conventional wisdom has come around to admitting that Batman ‘66 is great, it’s time for a reappraisal of the Schumacher bat-films. While they’re not necessarily good, they’re a visual riot that are certainly never boring and are, indeed, endlessly fascinating.
this has the most phallic looking batmobile
Not particularly good, mainly due to sudden shifts in tone. At times it feels like it inherited parts from the earlier Burton films (unfortunately not the aesthetics though) while also introducing a lot a camp which makes it jarring. Add to this a weak, messy plot and some stupid dialog and you get a pretty weak film.
Batman Forever is… not good. To quote Honest Trailers, “this is the worst movie I’ve ever seen more than 10 times.” The acting is mostly good, but EXTREMELY over-the-top, especially Jim Carrey as The Riddler, and Tommy Lee Jones as Two-Face is just… bizarre! Keaton was recast by Val Kilmer, and honestly his version of Batman is the most forgettable of them all. He isn’t the worst, but he isn’t that good. There are two things I genuinely love about this movie: 1. Chris O’Donnell’s Robin arc where he wants revenge against Two-Face for murdering his family. It’s done pretty well, and is very emotionally investing and even makes Robin look classy and actually fairly developed in comparison to the rests of the movie. The second is Riddler’s plan to use TV to steal people’s personal information, like bank records and test scores. That is so ahead of it’s time! It made no sense back then, but after the internet was fully developed much later, this plan makes a lot more sense. Otherwise, this film, though not horrible, tries too little, and just comes across as half-assed. RATING: 4/10
Deeply flawed, incredibly silly, and far too over the top for its own good...but I can’t help loving the hell out of the sleazy neon production design, Elliot Goldenthal’s brassy score, and the overall wacko rock opera-ness of Batman Forever. So sue me, I love it.
Biggest gripe- the riddler and two-face both act crazy and goofy.... like the joker. They are the same character... Just a bad batman film. There are redeeming qualities of the film- although i cant think of any. I suppose its still fun to watch and have a good time even though as a film its trash.
Can I persuade you to take a sandwich with you, sir?  I'll get drive-thru. Batman Forever was just as bad as I remembered. It’s a giant disappointment after the greatness of Burton’s Batman and Batman Returns. Schumacher brought the same OTT silliness of The Lost Boys but this time it isn’t fun.  Val Kilmer is the most attractive and perhaps least interesting Bruce Wayne/Batman (haven’t seen Affleck’s Batman so his could actually be the most boring version). He was kind of flat but dude could rock those glasses.  Poor Nicole Kidman did her best but wasn’t given a lot to work with as Dr Chase Meridian, who’s main character trait was a Batman fetish.  Ugh, the villains turned it up to 11 but not in a good way. You expect that level of irritatingly over the top madness from 90’s Jim Carrey but what was Tommy Lee Jones doing?  Chris O’Donnell was ok as orphaned acrobat Dick Grayson/Robin, his interactions with Alfred were probably the only things that stopped him from just being an annoying scamp and made him semi likeable.  The one bright spot was Michael Gough as the best Alfred, who luckily survived the Burton to Schumacher transition (such a shame Michael Keaton didn’t).  For some ridiculous reason I’m actually going to watch Batman & Robin...why am I doing this to myself?
We had to leave the theater because a friend's car alarm was going off in my parent's driveway. He got paged #911. Didn't bother me at all.
I’ve had toothache that was more fun than this
More like Batman Three-ever. Learn how to count, Schumacher.
imagine thinking this is bad.
I have a lot of nostalgia for Batman Forever. As a kid I loved Jim Carey and Batman, so seeing them together was a dream come true. It's also worth mentioning that I was a pretty dumb kid. This movie isn't good by any means, the script is bad, Tommy Lee Jones' performance as Two-Face is terrible, and it tries to be a semi-sequel to Burton's Batman movies, but it's too campy to be even slightly related. However, there's a lot of fun to be had with it. It's silly and over the top, but some of the performances are great (Jim Carey is the least Riddler-like Riddler possible, but it works so well in this universe, and I actually like Val Kilmer as Batman quite a bit) and the silliness works to the movie's favour. Overall, it's very enjoyable, if a little too much.
You ever dance with the devil in the neon-soaked PG-13 S&M nightmare?
Kilmer isn't good as Batman, and Robin is terrible.
After watching Batman & Robin, you can tell that Schumacher was a bit restrained by Burton's previous two movies while making this one. It jumps back and forth from Burton's to Schumacher's style quite often, making it very disjointed in tone. Kilmer's a decent Batman/Bruce Wayne in a similar style as Keaton. Nicole Kidman's character is so shoehorned in and unnecessary. Really sucks out the fun and slows down the pace. I used to love this one as a kid but now I find both villains grating. I'll take Arnold's Mister Freeze over these two any day.
Sure, whatever.
If Batman Returns was “too dark” then Batman forever takes it in the complete opposite direction. Director Joel Schumacher was hired to lighten the series up and make it both more family friendly and merchandise friendly.  The story follows Batman who goes up against two criminals, Two-Face and the Riddler. Meanwhile Bruce takes in a young Dick Grayson who’s family was tragically murdered.  Val Kilmer takes over the role of Batman from Michael Keaton and he’s... ok. He’s certainly not a bad actor but I also feel he’s not quite the right fit for this role even if, for the most part, he delivers what he needs to. Tommy Lee Jones finally gets a chance to overact and have a little fun, but the performance is also weirdly 2 dimensional, Jones hams it up rather then creating a well rounded opponent to Batman. Jim Carrey plays the riddler and does what he does in every other film, plays up his elastic face and various voices, plays this character at such a high level the entire film that never once does he feel like a real human being. I’d even say it borders on exhausting. Nicole Kidman plays Dr. Chase and she is given some of the worst dialogue I can think of (“Let’s just say I could write a hell of a paper on a grown man who dresses like a flying rodent”). Kidman’s not particularly good here but it’s more a fault of the writing, her character feels very underdeveloped, she’s there to provide Bruce/Batman with a love interest and someone he can talk to about his parents murder and that’s really it. Chris O’Donnell on the other hand gets the film’s strongest character arc as Dick, he’s quite good although how did he learn to drive a bat boat/submarine?  The film is filled with bright colours, Gotham City looks like a computer game, characters are like cartoons and it’s all very in your face, one might even say a bit much. I think Director Joel Schumacher was trying to find a balance between the camp of the 60’s series and the dark tone of Burton’s films and neither quite work, they don’t gel together, but the film is enjoyable regardless. Batman forever isn’t the best Batman film, but it’s certainly not the worst.
As a Batman film, it’s no-where near as good as Batman Returns, but it’s a pretty fun mid-90’s action film. It’s jarring to see big Tommy Lee Jones ham it up and Jim Carrey is bordering on parody by this point, but the designs for both characters work well, although imagine if they’d kept Billy Dee. The CG reminds me of a PC game that I played as a wee boy. Maybe Myst?  The relationship between Nicole Kidman and Val Kilmer is a bit weird though. They meet, Batman calls her work naive and she immediately tries to shag him. Definitely more of an afterthought than in the previous films.
It's been years since I've seen this, and now I know why. Pretty much unwatchable.
“Your entrance was good... his was better.”  Batman Forever can best be described as a Dick Sprang era inspired hallucinogenic trip of Dutch angles, spotlights, neon colors, over-acting, and pseudo-dystopian set design. Burton’s dark and twisted Batman and Batman Returns feels like a totally different film franchise when compared to Schumacher’s Batman Forever and Batman & Robin. Batman Forever is an exercise in excess, a case study of consumption, a microcosm of madness if you will (I’ll stop). My problem with this film is not that it’s over-the-top and cartoonish, but that things get out of hand far too quickly. Allow me to elaborate... Joel Schumacher is a solid director, but someone I feel was not the right choice to direct cartoonish and over-the-top Batman movies. That job was suited for one man and one man only. A man known for his unique style of comedy and directing. A man so willing to direct a superhero film, he went ahead and created his own character since he couldn’t secure the rights to an official one. That man is none other than Sam Raimi. Yes that’s right, Batman Forever is yet another movie I think should have been directed by Raimi. But I wasn’t the only person who thought so, Raimi came very close to directing the movie, but was rejected since Schumacher was the more “accomplished” director at the time. Raimi would have brought the balance Batman Forever is desperately lacking. Just think of his zany directing style mixed with that set design. We could have had Bruce Campbell as Two-Face for crying out loud! Unfortunately, in this timeline we have the Schumacher edition. But it’s not all bad news, far from it. Batman Forever works surprisingly well, and feels relatively fresh and inventive all these years later. I guess its a refreshing change from the doom-and-gloom editions of the Caped Crusader we’ve gotten more recently. And if you know anything about my cinematic tastes, you’ll know I’m a complete sucker for live-action cartoons. I mean the Kevin Conroy animated series is less of a cartoon than Batman Forever, and that’s literally a cartoon. I respect the direction Schumacher took Batman, and the aesthetic he went for was near perfect I think. I have a big problem with his use of comedy though. As that was an area that he went way too overboard with. Of course you can’t talk about Batman Forever without talking about the man behind the mask. Or maybe you can. Val Kilmer seems to be the least-talked about Bruce Wayne/Batman out of all the actors who’ve portrayed him. To be fair he doesn’t do a bad job, in fact I like his portrayal quite a bit. I think the fact that he was only Batman once and that the one movie he was Batman in was universally received as “eh” from critics and audiences cemented Kilmer’s place as irrelevant in the eyes of many.  "Let's start this party with a BANG!"  Someone who I think was either miscast or misdirected was Tommy Lee Jones as Two-Face. Although I find his portrayal to be entertaining, it’s a little too similar to the Joker. Jones comes off as just another overly crazed villain rather than a conflicted one. For a more accurate portrayal of Harvey Dent see Christopher Nolan’s quaint fan film The Dark Knight, not a lot of folks have checked that one out. Jim Carrey plays Jim Carrey as Jim Carrey where he acts a lot like Jim Carrey most of the movie. His take on The Riddler is honestly not bad, although he does get a little overbearing at times (see where this review is going yet?), but I suppose that is to be expected from him. I like Jim Carrey for the most part so his performance here isn’t anything out of the ordinary, especially from his mid-90s heyday (The Mask comes to mind). I swear Nicole Kidman was hornier in Batman Forever than she was in that movie where she dreamt of having an affair with a naval officer. Ho-ly Jesus she was a sight to behold in this movie; it felt like in every other scene she was ready to undress for Batman. Her character is an interesting concept rather than actually being interesting, if that makes any sense. Having her be a psychologist was an neat angle, but it doesn’t really go anywhere of value. As a result, her character gets lost in the sea of craziness that is Batman Forever. Robin as a general concept was a mistake, both in the comics and in the television/film adaptations. I’ve always found the idea of Batman having a sidekick to be so stupid. Robin’s inclusion in Batman Forever, is perhaps the film’s ultimate error. Everything involving his character was so pointless and so out of place. Chris O’Donnell does a fine enough job with the material he’s given, but I think we’re supposed to believe he’s like under the age of 21. I say this because he looks like he’s in his mid-20s in the movie, but he still has to be taken in for adoption? I guess in the Batman universe a legal adult is 30. The bulk of the film’s problems lie on the shoulders of Robin, which says a lot about his inclusion in the already populated screenplay.  For a good chunk of my childhood and my early teenage years, Batman Forever was either my second-favorite Batman film, or was in my top five. There an undeniable nostalgic connection I have with Batman Forever, but I don’t think it had much to do with how I felt about it during this watch. I think this movie gets lumped in with the comedic disaster that was Batman & Robin. So a lot of folks just assume it’s as bad or only slightly better. For what it is, Batman Forever is a solid Batman movie that may come as a breath of fresh air for those of you who hate the latest incarnation of the character. Here’s something else I’ll go ahead and say: Batman Forever is better than the vast majority of MCU movies. It’s certainly leagues ahead of anything the DCEU has put out.  Batman Forever is an imaginative, yet imbalanced Batman movie fueled by sheer insanity and goofiness. Because of that, I’ll always like this movie much more than most.
Seen on a normal television via VHS and normal broadcast sometime in the early 2000s. Liked it at the time, and looking back I continue to appreciate its weirdness and schlock.
This film is my ultimate guilty pleasure, I don't even care anymore, I love Batman forever. I'm not sure why or even how I just do.
Jim Carrey plays.... Peak Jim Carrey, so over the top stupid. Some of the costumes are pretty cool, but the movie is bad and funny, the batman butt shot and the grin he pulls when he gets rejected is great
This felt like watching two different films simultaneously, on one hand, there is this silly over the top wacky story of supervillains trying to create mayhem in a ridiculous looking Gotham, on the other, there is the story of a traumatized vigilante who finds love and meaning with fantastic camera work and overdone CGI. The decision to make this family-friendly by the studio was a big mistake and the deleted scenes prove that. There were a lot of minor continuity errors due to deleting scenes which could have given a whole new perspective to the narrative. Anyway, young Nicole Kidman is unbelievably hot.
These comedy Batman movies are great!
Within five minutes of watching Batman Forever, it's clear that the studio has gone through every effort to make Batman as kid-friendly as possible. First, they hired director Joel Schumacher to populate every frame with as much colourful neon light as possible. For the script they dumbed down the dialogue to nothing but one-liners and easy to follow exposition. The story is beyond ridiculous, emulating the 60s TV show Batman in the worst way. As villains, Jim Carrey and Tommy Lee Jones are as over the top as they possibly can be. The result is a film that has all the problems of Batman Returns but without the style or vision behind it. It's loud, incoherent, and more tedious than fun. And yet, I don't hate it. Nor do I love it. I'm just indifferent to it.
So I guess the one positive is… the relative absence of Bat-nipples?
I’m not sure how the superhero genre survived the 90s Batman films.
Even as a kid I'd watch this and be a bit repulsed. Val Kilmer not a bad Brucie at all though! (this could be Jim Carrey's worst performance)
Really not a very good film but I still enjoyed it cause HE’S BATMAN
Totally bonkers.
[upon reaching Claw Island]    Robin: Holey rusted metal, Batman!    Batman: Huh?    Robin: The ground, it's all metal. It's full of holes. You know, holey.    Batman: Oh.
I loved the colors and creative camerawork on display here, and more often than not the campy style worked for me, definitely much more than Schumacher's infamous Batman & Robin. This also kind of exhausted me at times, especially when the villains are onscreen. Tommy Lee Jones doesn't really bring a lot of definition or specific personality to the role of Two-Face; he's just loud. As for Jim Carrey... I made the mistake of finding out that Robin Williams was initially offered the role of the Riddler instead, and that was all I could think about for the rest of the movie. Histrionic villains aside, this entertained me pretty immensely. Schumacher is always kind of A Lot as a director, but here he pairs that extravagance with a comic-book aesthetic, and that combination pays off.
This movie spawned "Kiss From A Rose" does anything elae need to be said?
Why did I watch this movie. Why did I subject myself to this. This movie takes away everything that was good about the Burton films and throws them away. Burton’s stylistically creepy direction is replaced by Schumacher’s zany toy commercial and Gotham’s gothic aesthetic becomes a bright neon colorful headache. Val Kilmer is...ok as Bruce Wayne...I guess, but man, I can’t stand Chris O’Donnal as Robin. Aside from aging him up too much, this version of Robin has the same problem as Mr. “Fuck Batman” from Titans. Dick Grayson is one of the most likable characters in the entire DC and here he’s a whiny motorcycle brat. I can’t even put into words why this movie sucks so much. The only redeemable aspect of it is that I could be fun to watch with friends and make fun of. Even the music sucks. Fuck this movie!
And things begin to go astray. Needed more Burton and less Shumacher. Plot: Batman must battle former district attorney Harvey Dent, who is now Two-Face and Edward Nygma, The Riddler with help from an amorous psychologist and a young circus acrobat who becomes his sidekick, Robin.
It's been a long time since I've seen Tim Burton's batman movies, but surely they were never nearly this ridiculous right? Anyway, I"m kind of dreading watching Batman and Robin
Pretty good Batman Forever
One of my favorites as a kid. Not the case these days. Still enjoyable though.
bruce is soo awkward in this movie and i love it
Good thing Batman brought all those coins
You know...my problem isn't that it's all light hearted and goofy, it's that it does that while still taking alot from Tim Burton's version. Makes sense I guess since it's supposed to be the same continuity. Hell after seeing a few more of Joel Schumacher's films now, it almost seems like he was borrowing a bit of Burton's style. As a result the ridiculous fights and setpieces are undercut by the main story and vice versa. It tries to tell a more traditional Batman story at it's core while doing the more omage to the 60s as a wrapping and it doesn't really work. It's probably why Jim Carrey and Tommy Lee Jones are such scene stealers they're unburdened by the more serious nature of the protagonists subplots. Hell the Robin stuff is the most serious stuff in the movie but it's also the most boring, I can't get behind the guy struggling with vengence and loss because he expressed his anger by fighting a neon glowstick gang. I don't care about your motivation when I can just watch you fight the neon glowstick gang. I have a similar problem with Batman (btw Val Kilmer underrated here) but also the movie kind of just contrives his character development. At the beginning it's these repressed memories that just reveal why he chose a bat but then in the third act it becomes as living as both Batman and Bruce. The two seem disconnected from each other the former only barely makes sense within the story as it relates to Nicole Kidman's thirst for Batman. Speaking of which Nicole Kidman's character was the protagonist I liked most in the film, simply because her unapologetic lust for Batman is way more entertaining then any other characters feelings or drama. I mean seriously who INVITES masked men you don't know with a "scarred psyche" to your place so you can get laid??????? What a legend But anyway there's a lot to enjoy here if you can past what I couldn't. I would encourage giving this a second chance if you haven't
6/10 Although falling short of the pre-established dark tone that was present in the previous and much better installments, Batman Forever is a perfectly functional and light superhero action film that never fails to entertain. Also this is the first Batman film that really tries to develop the tortured character of Bruce Wayne but the bulk of those exceptionally done scenes were unfortunately cut to lighten the tone of the film and there in lies the film's huge problem is that it feels toned down to appeal to the younger audiences which is completely wrong, the previous Batman film, Batman Returns, wasn't for children and it was all the better for it because it was a mature and violent film that challenged the mind of the viewer with it's excellent antagonists. Here this just feels like a Saturday morning cartoon, fun but ultimately rather disposable. I'm not trying to say that kids shouldn't be allowed to enjoy Batman, the animated series and 60s television show are very much kid friendly and can be enjoyed by all ages however the films are, or at least Warner Bros. claim, made for the fans and I think if you are going to make a Batman film aim it at adults and don't be scared to be a dark, I think my point is proven by the success of Christopher Nolan's trilogy some years later. Although it's a very fun and entertaining film with some excellent character moments, Batman Forever is a let down because it feels like a kids film and not the dark adult superhero films that came before which were franchise highlights for me.
not to sound pretentious or anything but i miss when marvel and dc (marvel specifically) didn't have such a monopoly on their characters and they actually let a director with a vision make their movies. like yeah this is bad but how did we go from robin fighting a blacklit neon biker gang in a rainbow graffiti alley to your movie not being okayed by the studio execs until you put the grey vsco ig filter on it. extra half star for the butt shot.
35/100 The nipples.... *Ryan Reynolds "but why" gif*
this movie is worse than batman & robin, and that’s saying something
Two years after the masterpiece that was The Fugitive, Tommy Lee Jones has really let himself go.
Painfully bad...nauseating...two face and riddler are the same character, and they’re both so tiresome...seriously some of the worst shit I’ve ever seen
when will the dceu release movies that give off this kind of gay energy /:
Just, so bad. I only watched this because I had to do an article on all the Batmen for a film website I write for, but boy is Val Kilmer a cheesy Batman. And he's not even the worst part, what the hell are Tommy Lee Jones and Jim Carrey doing? Their performances are HORRIBLE! Nicole Kidman was the only good thing in this pathetic film. Especially comparing it to Nolan's thrilogy this is just a bloody joke.
In all aspects: color, dialogue, tone, aesthetic quality, and plot, it's a Saturday morning children's cartoon. I can see why people don't like it - it veers far away from both Burton's two gothic adventure films and Nolan's serious action vehicles and embraces campy shlock and profound silliness. I mean, there's a montage of Robin doing laundry for Christ's sake. Pure ridiculous shlock.
THE GOOD THINGS: - Parts of it are so entertaining that they don't deserve to be written off as completely stupid (Jim Carrey as The Riddler) - Some moments hit the mark when it comes to the character of Batman (the flashback scenes to the cave) - The new design for Gotham City is very creative even though the CGI does not hold up. THE BAD THINGS: - Parts of it are so stupid that they can't be considered entertaining (Tommy Lee Jones as Two-Face) - Some scenes completely miss the point of what Batman is about ('Chicks dig the car', 'I'll get Drive-thru') Batman Forever is a very mixed bag. It is definitely not a good movie and is a radical shift in tone and style to the previous two movies but it features enough entertaining elements to warrant a re-watch.
This movie is insane and I love it. Come at me.
As much as I hate admitting it, I actually enjoyed Batman Forever quite a bit. In all its cartoonishness (the title and poster alone do a good job capturing the essence of the film), it has a lot of charm, which is more than I can say about other bad superhero movies that I have watched. In a foolish attempt to distance itself from what made Burton's Batman so iconic, while also trying to maintain the depth of the previous two films, it's doing its own messy thing. It's a lot to juggle and that in and of itself is entertaining to watch (despite all the problems that are natually part of the package, of course). While I wish we could've gotten a real continuation to Burton's previous two films, I'm really glad we got this wonderful hot mess. I don't think I'll go anywhere near Batman & Robin though. This was more than enough for me.
I can imagine someone who’s first Val Kilmer movie was this thinking: “Really? This guy’s an actor?”
Seeing as though it's summer and I am being too lazy to drive across town to the library to rent anything new at the local library I figured I might as well give another watch to the live action Batman movies. Because, really, life is long and you have plenty of time to sit through this piece of garbage again. There are people out there who think that this is a better movie than "Batman and Robin". And while comparing two terrible things is a little silly, I have to say that I found this one to be way harder to watch than "Batman and Robin". Val Kilmer is probably my least favorite Batman. I would almost applaud his effort to portray the most bored human being ever if it weren't so ridiculously boring to actually watch. Tommy Lee Jones is terrible, Chris O'Donnell is terrible, Nicole Kidman is pretty terrible. And I don't think I need to say a whole lot about Jim Carrey in this, but he was seriously unwatchable in this. This has the same issues as "Batman and Robin" but features no bad ice puns and does not have that really good Smashing Pumpkins song in it (and the U2 single, "Hold Me, Kiss Me, Thrill Me", never sounds like more than a mediocre demo to me). This was pretty hard to get through.
The third film in the series has director Joel Schumacher taking over and we have Val Kilmer in the role of Bruce Wayne. This time out Batman comes under attack from Two-Face (Tommy Lee Jones) and The Riddler (Jim Carrey) as he must deal with the death of his parents as well as the feelings he has for Dr. Meridian (Nicole Kidman). It's strange that I felt BATMAN and BATMAN RETURNS featured terrific villains but a rather forgettable hero and the exact opposite happened here. I really enjoyed the change of pace that the screenplay went for as there's no question that Wayne is the main focus and I liked that we started to get some of his psychological stuff dealing with the death of his parents. All of this worked quite well and I even enjoyed the silly relationship he had with the Kidman character. The main problem with this movie are the villains who are just too boring and annoying. Two-Face isn't that bad but I think he's a step back from the previous two films. I really didn't care too much for the make-up and even the great Tommy Lee Jones couldn't bring too much life to the role. Carrey is basically playing himself and not really a character. His early scenes as the doctor are incredibly bad, over-the-top and they just come across very annoying. He fairs a little better as The Riddler but not enough to keep this from being the weakest villain so far. The rest of the performances are good. Kidman makes for a nice love interest and Chris O'Donnell is strong as Robin, although you could certainly argue whether or not the character should have been added. Drew Barrymore even gets a few good moments in her small part. As for Kilmer, I thought he made for the best Batman of the original four films. I thought the performance was rather deep and he managed the action scenes just fine. Schumacher isn't a favorite director of mine and while he makes for some pretty scenes here, I can't help but think another director might have done a bit better. Still, BATMAN FOREVER is the best of the original four films and is worth seeing.
after the dark and mature Batman Returns (1992) studio brought joel schumacher to deliver more light hearted and kid frienldy take on the caped crusaider and so begun to load the bullet that killed the batman movies for nine years to the gun. still ship riddler and two face tho
It's so bad it's funny, so it has that going for it. I was laughing 100% throughout the entire movie. "I cannot sanction your buffoonery."
Ya Batman forever is pretty rad... Prime alpha Val Kilmer is pretty rad... The Robin sidekick character is pretty rad... The Seal song at the end is pretty rad...
Gone is the dark-fantasy vibe of the first two Batman movies directed by Tim Burton, and now comes a neon-lit, glow-in-the-dark mishmash of colors! In other words, the era of Joel Schumacher! We also have a change of cast; Val Kilmer stars for his first and last time as Bruce Wayne, Batman, and joining him is Chris O'Donnell as Dick Grayson. Joining them is our lord and savior Nicole Kidman, cast as Doctor Chase Meridian. As for the villains, comedy king Jim Carrey is the Riddler, and Tommy Lee Jones is Two-Face. What do I think of Batman Forever . . . I'm not going to say this is the worst movie ever made. No, there are far worse movies than this, even DC movies. However, it doesn't change the fact that Forever is a massive step down in quality compared to the first two Batman movies of the time. The plot is sporadic and unbalanced(is Edward Nygma's masterplan ever utilized? The first half sets up Ed hypnotizing all of Gotham with his machines, and then . . . it just becomes a plot to kill Batman). The action is nothing special to speak of. The bright flashing colors of a newly decorated Gotham City doesn't help the eyes at all. And as for the acting . . . did Joel Schumacher tell everyone to camp it up intentionally? Maybe he did. I wouldn't doubt it. Seriously, everyone from the "chicks dig cars" Batman to moaning-while-rubbing-hands-down-the-Batsuit Chase Meridian to the really awfully campy reporter is not at all amusing. And as for the Riddler and Two-Face, they're the campiest of them all. Chris O'Donnell's Robin took my liking at first. He seemed to be the only one of the cast who showed actual emotion, I'll admit. But halfway through the movie, he became cocky and arrogant, unreasonably angsty. I would say Michael Gough's Alfred Pennyworth is the only character who isn't downgraded, but that really isn't speaking much. For a children's movie which actually does feel like a campy movie with a severely underdone script, there are certainly a lot of sexual innuendos that'll go over kids' heads. I don't know why they put them in Batman Forever, and I don't wanna know. This third installment of the Batman franchise left a bad taste in my mouth.
I actually enjoy this Batman movie. Must be nostalgia eyes or something. Val Kilmer wasn't bad in the title role, but I didn't like Nicole Kidman's character in the film. Just too token love interest. As for Jim Carrey as The Riddler, man he hammed it up in that role!
Let’s all stop pretending like this isn’t fun as hell and Val Kilmer isn’t the second best, second hottest, Bruce Wayne. Also, there’s no reason why Dick Grayson was that hot but he was and I’m thankful.
Style over substance, or as I like to think, style as the substance. The last I saw this, I believe I found Jim Carrey's performance to be annoying, and while it's intentionally (if that matters) over the top, I now find it fun and in that way he embodies the new direction Shumacher wanted to take this series. Thankfully Carrey's performance seems genuine only because it's the kind of performance we know to be natural to Jim Carrey, so somehow I don't get the impression he's trying too hard. Batman Forever's embrace of camp and buffoonery works to a certain degree, but after a while it can seem stale or at least unfulfilling. The vibrant and weird vision is certainly refreshing to revisit though. Even if it's dumb, insofar as its not grounded in much of anything intellectual or serious, it captures the spirit in its tone that probably gets at what most people actually like about superheroes and comics - they're over the top, action packed, display an elaborate clash between ideologies and personalities, and tap into some kind of imagination that extends just enough from reality to be worth thinking about. Its the heightened details like wardrobe, setting, backstories and m.o.'s. Comics are cartoons, and Schumacher embraces that with camp, gothic undertones and humor.
After watching Hereditary I needed something easier. Batman forever is for sure easier and stupider. A very hard movie to rate because it is besides Val Kilmer an all around terrible performances, ridiculous writing and world building but I mean it’s cheesy fun. You can’t really hate on it either but it is a really bad movie.
the craziest thing about batman forever is how hot val kilmer is in it.
When I was a kid this was pretty much the best thing that ever happened. I was like six when it came out and I still have the McDonald's glasses to this day. Then I grew up and I pretty much put it aside and thought it was terrible, especially during the Nolan years. But by blind simple doo-da luck, my heart had rewarmed to BATMAN FOREVER. It's flashy, frustrating and largely nonsensical, less of a narrative movie and more of a pop art installation. But it has some neat insights into Batman, it gets the majority of the Robin beats right, and Carrey's Riddler is like Frank Gorshin playing Jim Carrey, which is kind of just fascinating to watch. It has a lot of missteps, but it handles itself with so much confidence that it's hard not to like. This isn't remotely realistic storytelling, its only substance is its style. But as such it can be dazzling and ridiculous in equally entertaining doses. I turned my nose up at it for years, but I've come to sanction its buffoonery.
I enjoyed this when it came out but it is two fun baddies away from being as shit as Batman and Robin.
Each time i’ve watched this ive either watched drunk, high or both. I’m into the way this film lets me learn something new every time, starting with noticing the batnips, into your 40th watch and hearing Jim Carry wanted to shave a question mark into this scalp but was undergoing divorce hearings at court so he couldn’t.
i was fucking blasted when i watched this but i just remember certain moments like when the helicopter crashed into the statue of liberty.
Jim Carrey is attracted to men Okay let's get serious, I did like the movie but it's fucking weird.
How can I hate a film that’s Sontag’s “Notes on Camp” made flesh (and rubber)?  Takes as much inspiration from the original show as Burton’s films, and the result works way better than you remember. Envisioning The Riddler as a jilted stalker is more successful than whatever was going on with Two-Face, but you can’t win them all. The sets and shots are more theatrical than cinematic, if that makes any sense. Feels like a Vegas show at times.
I promised myself when I watched this movie all those years ago and it started to ruin the Batman franchise for me I would never watch this again. But I wanted to not only for the change, but as I’m older now I might be more open to it. It was better then I remembered but not as great as the Michael Keaton and Christian bale batman’s.
Why the hell is Bruce Wayne always telling 'his little secret' to every single lady he flirt with even when he doesn't remember her at all in the sequel? And most importantly, why is always Alfred supporting this wildness just to smiles in the distance when Batman is kissing other people? Keep that old man away from Robin
A studio-mandated tack away from the darkness of Burton's Gothic pulp leaves Shumacher's first entry in the Bat franchise lost between neo-noir pulp nihilism and kitschy comic book optimism, with a caustic hysteria hanging to the resulting amalgam that dooms its attempts at tongue-in-cheek humor as well as the psychological depth screenwriter Goldsman attempted to insert. The performances are equally blitzed, from Kilmer's Adam West pastiche--with an added layer of smarm and irony that deflate the very guilelessness that was West's charm--to the bizarre villains where Jones's manic ham giddiness is vastly preferable to Carey's antic slapstick hysteria--although, he too, has some stand out moments of complete, go-for-broke insanity. Schumacher and Goldblatt opt for a visual aesthetic that similarly seeks to meld the worlds, resulting in a nite-glo-tinted noir grotesque that channels the cheeky hyperactivity of the '60s incarnation in its wacky angles and quirky imagery but sets in the murky darkness of Burton's Gotham.
For some reason I thought this would be campy fun, but it's far more dour than I remember. Just long, dull scenes of Nicole Kidman and Bruce Wayne talking about psychology. Also, all the Robin stuff is boring, and both the villains suck, and everything else sucks too. Solid soundtrack though. Nicole Kidman throwing up the bat signal wearing a nightie cause she's trying to smash is funny though.
Jim Carrey’s charisma couldn’t even save this.

When you walk in the room and this movie is playing, you should probably walk out
The first and only time I watched this movie, my cousin mentioned meeting Nicole Kidman and I've been seething ever since.

People should give "Batman Forever" a shot for Val Kilmer's strong, competent performance of the caped crusader, himself. However, the dramatic changes in its casting, the Batmobile's new disturbingly phallic look and the franchise's shift to a more ridiculous, slap-happy tone can make "Batman Forever" a difficult sequel to stomach for purists of the first two films.
Okay. I get it. It's goofy. It's big, it's crazy, it's campy. But, hey. Y'know what else? Batman Forever might just be the most complete of the original four Bat flicks. I'm not kidding. I love Batman '89, and tolerate Batman Returns more than most, but in terms of what I'd watch between those two, this, and the abomination that followed? I will gladly, scratch that, happily watch this over any of them. For me, Batman Forever works so much better in some respects than the Burton films because it actually puts Batman and Bruce Wayne at the center. This was something that '89 and Returns didn't do as well. With Burton, it always felt like he was more interested in the villains than he was in the psychological aspects, or any aspects, of Batman and Bruce Wayne. Seriously, d'you ever wonder why Nicholson was billed over Keaton in the first movie? This film takes that issue and does away with it entirely, and is all the better for it. Here, Batman actually feels like a hero. Better yet, he actually feels like Batman, something Returns especially failed at. This film succeeds because it actually gives Bruce an arc, one that is actually understandable and relatable. As mentioned earlier, the movie is campy, but it doesn't detract from the experience. If anything, the movie is all the better for it. It's appropriately silly and goofy when it wants to be, but proves that it can be serious when it needs to be. And what's wrong with silliness? Here, the silliness is reserved for the action and for the villains, and its strongest there. The darker, more mature scenes are saved for scenes between Bruce and Chase discussing his troubled past, or scenes with Bruce simply talking to Alfred in the lair over his concern for Dick's desire for vengeance, but according to most people on the internet, this is called being 'tonally awkward'. I really couldn't disagree more, and find that the film strikes a good balance of tone. I'm not saying that Forever is flawless, and it certainly isn't a masterpiece either. There are some things that bug me about it, why the Hell is Bruce acting like Vicki and Selina never existed, why does Dick necessarily have to live with Bruce when he's clearly old enough to take care of himself, and the neon lights can get a little tiresome on the eyes. Overall, Batman Forever is still an entertaining and, dare I say it, under-appreciated movie. For all of the silly things in it, it's still a well-acted, well-shot movie with a good balance of tone and a fucking brilliant score. Seriously, listen to the track 'Batterdammerung' for proof. Happy 23rd anniversary to my most rewatchable original Batman movie, Batman Forever. I give this criminally under-appreciated movie an 8.3/10, which equals a grade of a B+.
Batman Forever is a massive disappointment. Joel Schumacher stepped in to direct and he did...something. Whether it's good or not is up to you. I don't like the incredibly cheesy writing. I also thought they could've done a better job with casting because Val Kilmer isn't exactly an intimidating ninja with a batsuit and Christopher O'Donnell isn't exactly the greatest Robin. Tommy Lee Jones could have been great as Two-Face but the writing turned him into Joker with half a face. The same thing is wrong with Jim Carrey as the Riddler. However, this is still a fun and enjoyable film. It has it's moments but it is still a hige letdown.
I like this one fuck me I guess
Not sure what WB was thinking but this movie was just ridiculous and only the next movie in this franchise makes this one bearable.
What I like: Nicole Kidman What I didn't like: It was a mistake to produce this movie without Tim Burton as the director. Val Kilmer was a mistake and also Tommy Lee Jones. I thought he was a new character but his character was also in the previous film played by another actor. The change in the cast did not make sense and Robin sucked eggs in this movie.
Not amazing, pretty safe. But worth a watch honestly.
Colorful. Garish. Obnoxious. Ridiculous. Box Office gold. A decent enough vehicle for Carrey's ever-unsubtle shenanigans but Tommy Lee Jones should be ashamed of himself. Kilmer's performance feels like he flat lined and the crew forgot to check his pulse. Loses half a star for being rambling and dull. This hour and a half film feels like four.
I rated this above The Dark Knight for the Seal song. “Kiss from a Rose” is iconic.
Batman Forever is a unique animal to be sure. On the one hand the film tried some new angles for the franchise including introducing Robin, exploring Batman's dual identities, and embracing Burton's darkness alongside the campiness of the 60's Adam West series. Schumacher's unique neon aesthetic and the well cast villains that playing off each other superbly are also highlights of the film. On the other hand uneven plot structure, wooden dialogue/acting, and a lackluster love interest drag the film down somewhat. Not the best but far from the worst. I'll always have a soft spot for it.
Better than the second one, as long as you completely throw believability out of the window it's fun enough to watch
Joel Schumacher, to quote your own movie to you: "Has anyone ever told you that you have a SERIOUS impulse control problem?!"
Stupid, over the top, cheesy... but oddly watchable- after Burton’s gothic fairytale masterpieces, Schumacher doubled-down on the neon and ordered extra ham... and while not good is fun... now at the time it seemed an awful idea, but with where Batman vs Superman and Justice League went, this plays as a more fun and more coherent movie- who would of thought that? Time seems to have been kind to this one!
This is still pretty bad. Despite having more charm to it then the next film, but it's still really bad. Val Kilmer is the Cape Crusader this time. He is fighting Harvey Dent, Two Face after a acid attack. Two Face kills young acrobat, Dick's family, turning him into Robin. Meanwhile, Edward Nigma vows to suck out the brains of Gotham's residents as he runs around in green tights and red hair. After the success of Burton's two films. Ushering in a darker side to comic book films Joel Schumacher took five steps backward and brought it back to that goofy side. Neon colors of purple and green, horribly pitched one-liners dialog and of course...bat nipples. Kilmer isn't the best Batman, not as good as Bale or Keaton. He is though a good Bruce Wayne. Playing the psychologically damaged playboy try well and it suits his desires for the sexy Nicole Kidman character. But god damn if Chris O'Donald isn't one of the most annoying characters in all of cinema. Whiney, bitchy, with his stupid priced earring. Also, what the hell was the with the Robin punch line on the moving rock? He goes from hard edge revenge seeker to that?! Now let's talk about Tommy Lee Jones and Jim Carrey. Jesus Christ. The Riddler and Two-Face are probably two of Batman's low key opponents. They don't relay on overly dramatic entrances because they don't play to their own drum, like The Joker. They are simply fed up and want to cause havoc. Here though they dance around like two kids hopped up on Halloween candy. Also the homosexual innuendos between the two is pretty apparent. Something Schumacher was not afraid to showoff. With that and the constant crouch and ass shots of men in rubber suits. I'm not prejudice or anything, but damn can you make it anymore obvious? I don't hate it though. Despite the odd choice of characteristics it's fun to watch the villains, Kilmer really plays it serious for the Bruce Wayne character and Nicole Kidman is....let's just say I love Australia because of two things; Koalas and Nicole Kidman in this film.
In Jim Carrey's contract it said: “Just be yourself times a million. Oh, and were sorry that Tommy Lee Jones hates you.”
Kilmer is impressively bland as Bruce Wayne. I know the joke has been run into the ground, but the Bat-Nipples really are ridiculous.
Holy shit i forgot this existed
What a bunch of crap...
Seriously, they should have put Kiss from a Rose in the movie proper. I would have given it an extra half a star. The movie contained dreadful acting from all except Tommy Lee Jones. The storyline was uninteresting. It was, all in all, a waste of two perfectly good hours.
Oh jeez.. this is the worst Batman movie I have watched thus far. Jim Carrey as The Riddler may very well be the most annoying and unbearable character in movie history!  I do have to admit that Batman Forever does have its own kind of weird nineties charm though. I like the colors used and the overall vibe. In a way it is so bad that it kind of becomes a little entertaining, but it does not help it much. It still sucks! I guess that I just have to watch Batman & Robin now to find out which one is really the bottom of the barrel when it comes to Batman movies.
My dude Schu may not be great at action but he is great at cape swirls (more here)
I don’t know how I forgot how bad this is.
So, after parents complained that Tim Burton had made his "Batman" films took dark in tone, the studio apparently designed to change everything about those films and make Batman into a completely different character. Joel Schumacher was the director the studio chose to change the direction, because apparently his previous films weren't dark at all. I guess the studio never watched "Flatliners" or "Lost Boys." But, I mean, for the lighter tone they wanted, Schumacher was the perfect tone, because he managed to make a very light Batman. When I was younger, I really enjoyed this film. I didn't know that much about quality at the time, but I thought this film had some pretty good moments and that it was ultimately a good time. Now that I'm older, I realize that I was pretty stupid as a kid and had no taste, because this film is not a good one. I don't know what prompted the studio to make some of these changes that completely destroyed the character. There are some things I do enjoy about this film. First of all, I actually think Val Kilmer was a pretty good choice to replace Michael Keaton. He gives a lot of the same vibes that Keaton did, but without making a complete impression of Keaton. He is definitely a different incarnation of the character, but with the mannerisms that made Keaton such a great fit for the character. I will always have a special place for Keaton in my heart, but I will also say that Kilmer did a very good job as this character. Jim Carrey was the thing I loved the most about the film when I was younger, and he is still the shining light in this film. I know that Carrey is pretty much just playing a version of himself on screen, but I like that decision. The Riddler has been featured in many different incarnations, but the crazy version has always been my favorite, so I very much enjoy to see Carrey go all crazy. There are some pretty good action scenes in the film. The scene I always go to the most is when the Riddler is destroying the Batcave. That scene was very well-shot, and well acted by Carrey. It's also one of those scenarios that I never thought I would see on the screen, so that also infused some positivity into my mind. I also like the third act fight sequences. There are some incredible camera-work done when Batman is flying in the Batwing, and also when he is falling towards his death in a pit. I like those moments, even though the third act is a little ridiculous. And there ends my positives, because this is a very flawed film. I hate the screenplay for the film, and it was written by someone who would eventually go on to win an Oscar. Right from the opening scene of the film, it's very clear that this is a cheesy approach to the Batman character, and I hated every single cheesy lined that followed the first one. Batman was never that character. Not even in 1960s did he have such horrible lines, and that was a very cheesy version of the character. Cheesy is not funny, and this film definitely proves that point. There are so many characters that I don't like. Nicole Kidman's character and her relationship with Bruce Wayne felt so incredibly forced and I didn't even believe the storyline that made the two of them meet up. And Dick Grayson is such a douchebag in this film that it's hard to like him. It's very hard to root for him, so when he has that moment at the end where he realizes that he can't live by hate, I didn't believe it, because I didn't believe the character or any of his motivations. By far, the worst character in this film is Two-Face. I didn't get anything from him. I didn't get his motivations for hating Batman, nor I did the reason why he was all of a sudden crazy. I also think his transformation should have been a bigger part of the film, instead of just something shown on the television. And I don't understand why Tommy Lee Jones felt like he had to play a different version of the Joker. I never remember reading anything about that approach when I first read about Two-Face in the comicbooks. He is crazy, but is not the newest Joker in town. This film also looks terribly fake. There are so many visual effects shots of the city, and in all of them, it looks like something I could have done on a computer. I don't know what the budget was wasted on, but it definitely wasn't the visual effects. There are also some really bad shots of a full CGI-character, and sometimes when they interact with real things, it makes the film look like an un-finished videogame sequence. This is not a film that I will recommend. There are a few shining parts, but ultimately, the film fails. It was an attempt to reintroduce Batman with a different tone to the public, but instead, they managed to destroy everything that was ever Batman, and I can never understand why.
an easy way to tell apart gays and straights is to ask their opinion on this movie and if they say its bad. just assume theyre straight and not worth your time
This third outing goes for laughs instead of darkness and the results are a little mixed. Kilmer is fine is the lead and the film does benefit from Carrey and Jones as the bad guys but it's playful nature does not match the surroundings. It still entertains though.
Batman Forever is entertaining, but Two Face is just a goofball with silly make up, and Riddler was just Jim Carry being Jim Carry. This movie seems to be more colorful and comedic. I just feel this was trying to be much more mainstream.
It may not be the best Batman movie, but compared to Batman & Robin it might as well be The Godfather. Flawed as it is, Batman Forever boasts two satisfyingly over the top performances from Jim Carrey and Tommy Lee Jones, with Carrey in particular being the best part of the movie, even if that’s not saying much. Val Kilmer isn’t great as Batman or Bruce Wayne, but he is decent, and he’s much better than George Clooney. That being said, then action is good, the script is surprisingly good, and the film as a whole is fun but doesn’t make you think.
Birth Year Challenge film #3: Some truly bad, campy, gay, gay, GAY fun. God, it's so fucking gay. Joel Schumacher, please save Batman from Zach Snyder and Ben Affleck!
Birth Year Challenge Film 1 So, turns out I had watched this one before, but I'm still gonna count it because, a, I probably wouldn't have watched it again if it weren't for this challenge and, b, the only thing i actually remembered was Sugar and Spice looking hot because apparently I was a big, horny dyke when I was a kid. Honestly, this was a delight. It was so supremely gay. Jim Carrey looked like Annie Lennox serving up some Purge a la Space Channel 5 Part 2 glam one-piece realness. Tommy Lee Jones kept almost kissing the Riddler. Obviously, bat nipples. Obviously, Robin wearing that stupid, little earring and running around the Wayne manor like a twink. I mean, we all know that it was gay, but I just wanted to say that I was impressed and I appreciated what the film was doing.
objectively this movie is Bad but if ur Gay u know it's a true masterpiece
“I always hated those titles like ‘Batman Forever’. That sounds like a tattoo that somebody would get when they’re on drugs or something. Or something some kid would write in the yearbook.”             — Tim Burton  This is a bit of a Rorschach test in that you see what you want to see in it. The film I’m describing here will probably not come across as the film someone else watched—objectively I know that this is like, very very bad, and many people whose opinions are more credible than mine have said it’s a total stinker. But I think it’s kind of a brilliant stinker, and one that I’m still openly enthusiastic about. Batman Forever is possibly one of the campiest displays of excess ever put to screen, and one of the most enjoyable. Aside from a few initial CGI faux-pas in the first half hour or so, the film is gorgeous; and I say that with utmost honesty. Bob Ringwood and Ingrid Ferrin design costumes with a sharply clear vision and an intricacy that’s honestly breathtaking, no matter how brightly camp they are. It all comes together to create the sense of a mishmash, technicolour stage production that was somehow thrust onto the big screen, an accidental jackpot of charm and idiosyncrasy.  The staple areas of the city are created and destroyed in a devilishly unique way, with every set piece going out in a slow motion crumble and a flurry of blinding sparks. Barbara Ling’s production design paints Gotham as rich and claustrophobic; successfully combining gothic architecture with neoclassical imagery and striking, soft-lit neons. The only way I can think to describe it is to say it’s a sort of beta-vapourware kind of style, if that aesthetic movement took itself less seriously and harkened back to the 60s instead of the 80s. It plays with the idea of a place that speaks to both the past and the future, like the Roman statues looming over the electric city as a constant reminder of a bygone pre-industrial age. Similarly, Riddler’s space-age holographic technology is constantly at odds with his tiny apartment filled with archaic machinery and riddles shrouded in card and glue. The whole film grapples with the idea of paradox or duality, and it exists in nearly all of the major player characters: Two-Face for obvious reasons, Bruce coexisting with Batman, Chase’s struggle with reason and desire, Dick’s dual wish for revenge and justice. I mean, none of these ever get developed in any concrete way but hey, the sentiment was there I guess.  This pretty cerebral sentiment knits together the entirely goofy script, which is kind of like saying there’s a solid gold foundation holding up a house made out of mud. The thing is, the goofy dialogue and laughable story arcs are really, really fun. I never end up caring that the storyline is full of conveniences and doesn’t make any sense, because I’m too busy having such a good goddamn time.  Because of this, the film itself is a stumbling paradox: with its attempt cheesy humour becoming wildly nonsensical and the more serious aspects of the film becoming so laden with tropes that it speaks more to the satirical than the emotional. The weird thing is that this doesn’t massively sink it, and it works spectacularly well as an openly bizarre romp that seeks to obliterate classic comic book stereotypes by exposing how stupid they are. And yeah, that sounds pretentious and douchey, but I’m still trying to justify just how much I enjoy this every time I watch it.   Also, the amount of trivia that has stuck around in my brain about this film is shocking. Tommy Lee Jones and Jim Carrey try to out act each other in every scene they’re in because Jones apparently hated Carrey and reportedly said, to his face, that he couldn’t “sanction [his] buffoonery.” Val Kilmer didn’t talk to the director for two weeks because he told him to stop acting childish and treating other cast members rudely. There’s a shot of one of the extras fully falling down the stairs that they just kept in for some reason. This will all haunt me forever. It’ll haunt me Batman Forever.
what can i say? im gay and i love to have fun!!
Playful, silly, immature, bad writing, lacking proper plot structure but hey; a good film is a good film.
In a film brewing with Freudian ideology and sexual undertones, Bruce Wayne/Batman addresses his psychological and emotional trauma that he's suppressed since childhood. In the midst of French horns, brightly lit neon lights, and imagery of the human body, Bruce faces the questions about himself he never could before and fosters a surrogate family of his own. Chase Meridian serving as the mother figure, and Robin as a son for whom can be raised by the father Bruce never had. Admittedly the film is mostly a fleeting but enjoyable lighthearted live action comic book adventure and doesn't strive to be much more than that, but it is nice to have something underneath the surface and time given for the characters to live and breathe.
Nolan could never.
guilty pleasure
It's like Joel Schumacher was given a one sentence description of a few Batman characters and added nipples.
I’ve come to the conclusion that Batman is kind of a boring character. (This is coming from someone who *loves* The Long Halloween.)
I’m more partial to this movie than most other people since I saw it at a young age and before the original Batman. Still, you can see shades of the far worse sequel here.
Imagine how much better this would be if it didn't have Jim Carrey and Tommy Lee Jones giving career worst performances? The rest of this outside of them is complete and utter nonsense but as I'll get to with Batman & Robin, I don't hate what Schumacher did with this franchise and I still to this day absolutely love the music. Just a shame about y'know, those villains. Ugh.
It's this kind of garbage that keeps good stories from coming out of Hollywood and nearly killed the Batman franchise.
Batman Forever is a class act in how to make a horrible film. This movie is so bad that it’s laughable. You could literally sit for a little over an hour and a half and just laugh at how stupid this film really is. Perhaps the only upside to this movie is that they made Jim Carrey the Riddler. That is the only good thing. Batman Forever is a film that should be avoided at all costs.
This is hailed as the best film of all time for a good reason. Al Pachino is great in this, but where was Marlon Brando? Isn’t he on the cover?
Fixed the toilet issue. Good movie as well. But the sink’s missing a tap
one of the best commercial movies in malayalam, must watch
For the so called "best movie of all time" it was pretty bad.
The iconic theme song,memorable performances still makes it a pleasure to watch!
One of the finest entertainers Malayalam ever had.
This was Marty Scorsese’s arrival into mainstream cinema in America, and also the career launchpad for Robert De Niro and Harvey Keitel. The film was hailed as one of the most original films in years, and even American history, and that thought still holds up well today. Passionate and energetic, it is one of the most groundbreaking films of the 1970’s.
Johnny Boy: what color is the pink panther? Charlie, taking his clothes off: Johnny Boy you're so fucking stupid
Will soon be buying a blu ray of this film since my fucking dvd copy keeps dying halfway through. Great film overall though, especially considering how early of a film this was for good old Marty.
William Blake shout-out. I guess that one guy was a British lit major.
scorsese’s the searchers, showing despicable characters and how the environment they live in makes them into maniacs. throughout charlie touches fire, signaling how close to danger he is and how attracted he is to it. the film has so much energy to it, one of those films that inspires you to make films of your own.
What’s a mook?”
STREET LEVEL. Loose plot, hungry actors. True grit.
“Mean Streets” showcases two great, star-making performances from Robert De Niro and Harvey Keitel, and plenty of the Scorsese brilliance that would soon come into true fruition in the future, but is overall just forgettable, mostly due to a narrative of events that feel too loose, unfocused, or scattered to feel like one complete piece. But all in all, it’s still a pretty decent effort, especially for something that was clearly very personal to Scorsese himself, just nothing really special either.
Meanders a bit, but finishes extremely strong. Charlie says he finds salvation on the streets, and he's one of Scorsese's more interesting and complex characters, hitching his wagon to such an unbridled force of chaos as Johnny Boy. The performances and soundtrack are top-notch.
Martin Scorsese: You don't make up for your sins in church. You do it in the streets. You do it at home. The rest is bullshit and you know it.
82 Not as good as most other Scorsese movies but still really great.
A great  film with amazing quotes and fantastic actors !
Of course Deniro’s character is named Jonny Boy, all that means is trouble  Pre-1980s Movie Marathon #21
A movie about a man in New York named Charlie who is being suffocated by Catholic guilt. Every night, he enters the seedy bar owned by his friend Tony and he is submerged into red lights. Sin consumes Charlie and his guilt causes him to suffer. Throughout the movie, he desperately tries to do good deeds in order to regain some sort of spiritual homeostasis. The movie contains brilliant scenes displaying the racism, machismo, greed, and mental illness within the Italian-American community. It is a MUST WATCH!
THE FIRST MARTIN SCORSESE STEP- 10/10
One of my all times favorite, Mean Streets is the exemple for the perfect sound track and how it goes along perfectly with the history. If you are a fan of Scorsese’s movies or want to see a good movie, a strongly recommend you to watch it!
This is Scorsese at his most bare. It feels like an incomplete film to a 21st century viewer, but the experience of witnessing a master try out his craft is worth the price of admission. So much of what is in this film has become "normal" in the modern world of cinema, and it speaks to the influence of Scorsese as an artist.
Like the beginning of 'Mean Streets', You could be my baby
You don't make up for your sins in church, you do it in the streets. The rest is bullshit and you know it.
Some films really benefit from a rewatch. This is not one of those films at all. The mesmerising effect of the visuals really didn't knock me out on this second viewing - brought on by seeing Taxi Driver for this first time the over night. The pacing is meanderingly slow. The dialogue that on first approach several years ago had a sense of joy now just feels stilted in parts and drives me up the wall at overs. The biggest issue with rewatching Mean Streets is that it gives room for the obvious weaknesses of the plot to shine through. I get this was made years ago and set the scene for many gangster movies, hence the 4.5 star rating for a film I struggled to watch this time round. I remember the effect it had on me the first time I watched it' the captivating nature of it; of the way each scene was shot. Of the characters and there glamorous delinquency, the juxtaposition between shooting for Hollywood but shooting New York - 70s New York - the rougher times of the city. Taxi Driver may have been Paul Scholes love letter to New York but this is Scorseces, the mob and the Italians realised on this screen. Despite my struggling to rewatch it would be unfair not to recognise how original the film was when it came out and would certainly be unfair to dull the mesmerising effect of the film because it is slow upon rewatching. The fact I didn't notice any of that on first watch says enough about the direction and the film's status. In comparison to Taxi Driver the main thing of note in Mean Streets is that there's many scenes in Mean Streets that serve little to no plot purpose, by the time of Taxi Driver that's completely removed from the equation; a remarkable improvement in a short space of time.
One of the best Jean Luc Godard's movies. Jokes aside, this movie really is 200% nouvelle vague and expecially Godardian. Mostly in its characters. Scorsese approaches his first movies in an anarchic way already known to french filmmakers of the seventies, not just conceptually, but also on the field with all the long shots, the hand-held cameras and the way of cutting. This movie screams.
These streets are mean, bruh.
bitch scorsese invented the color red OKAY
Beautifully shot, experimental moments, a pleasure to watch. I watched over three days, continuity of plot line suffered some, but the vision was intact.
an aimless, self-indulgent ode to violent hypermasculinity that perfectly captures the insouciant arrogance of wanna-be gangsters and middle-aged delinquents who somehow still think that ripping off kids and picking up girls and getting into pointless fights are "the cool things to do". the movie meanders through overly shadowed sets and street corners, never really doing or saying anything and just relying on the sheer audacity and uncouth verbosity of its central characters to carry it along at a limping pace. credit where credit is due though: stellar acting performances by robert de niro and harvey keitel - i did hate robert de niro's smarmy johnny boy and his headstrong arrogance but i concede that my blinding rage was only possible because de niro committed so fully to his character. i'd be the first to say that misogyny and racism shouldn't automatically disqualify a film from being good or having other artistic merits but all of the macho self-entitled greasy violent aggression was aggravating and the way they treat and portray women as objects and plot points and things to be had and touched and possessed holy crap i just wanted to scream; its a celebration of sin if i ever saw one, even if the film pays lip service to other interpretations
Godard mon amour - Scorsese
Acting, cast - awesome! Story line, plot, etc. - weak.
Like listening to your favorite band's debut, self-released EP. A little raw, and perhaps not quite as coherent as their later work, but still, all of the ingredients are there. All of Martin Scorsese's ticks, like his fetish for steady cam, affinity for pop music, and tendency towards themes of masculinity, violence, and faith are on display, just in a cruder package. Harvey Keitel can be a little wooden, and the script can kind of fall into becoming "Eh! Oh!: The Movie," but Robert DeNiro (who, even at 30, looks 55) is great as a loony neighborhood kid, and there are plenty of brilliant scenes. The "private party" for Jerry that slowly descends into a drunken melee and the harrowing closing scenes are representative of a more visceral style the Scorsese moved away from when he started working on prestigier and more period focused work in the 2000s and 2010s. I'd lament his departure from this grittier approach, but the truth is that I don't know that the best moments from this film could be re-created by a seventy year old established director. Mean Streets is a story about angry and confused young men of a particular time and place, and it took an angry and confused young man from that time and place to tell it.
There should be more poolroom brawls set to Please Mr. Postman. I had only seen this once, before I started reviewing movies online... it had to be at least a decade ago. Thus, I figured I need to talk about more Scorsese here anyhow and it playing on TCM last night meant that this was the right time, right place for me. That initial movie I more liked the movie than loved it and alas, this opinion has not changed the second go-around. The general idea is fine of following around a young man (Keitel) who has a loan shark uncle yet due to Catholic guilt-this already became a Scorsese trademark-is unsure if he wants to follow in his family footsteps. Meanwhile, he has a loose cannon friend (DeNiro) who causes problems and he has a girlfriend who is ostracized because she has epilepsy. If only I could have cared more about the story or the characters... I can still say that this is good and that is nothing to sneeze at. This is clearly a low-budget effort, pretty gritty with naturalistic lighting (some scenes are bathed in red and it makes for a great image) and intimate camerawork. Even back then Scorsese knew how to create a quality soundtrack-there are some old Italian songs and-shock of shocks-The Rolling Stones but otherwise it's old R&B, including the original version of Please Mr. Postman by The Marvelettes that is heard during a rough and tumble donnybrook in a pool hall; what a juxtaposition that was. Of course its biggest asset aside from having a director that would later become a legend is the two leads who are great actors and one became a legend himself. That for certain helped me watch this even if I don't love Mean Streets like many do.
Falls in line with the other great Scorsese/De Niro mob movies: Goodfellas, Casino, Shark Tale, And, hopefully, The Irishman.
mean streets, taxi driver, and raging bull are the Scorseses to swear by! even though he's always made great movies and is still a great soul, there's something about early Scorsese that I really love more than any of his other stuff; it's the grit, the fly-on-the-wall Cassavetes-inflicted camerawork (Cassavetes actually advised Marty to make mean streets after he said that he thought boxcar bertha was "a piece of shit". can you blame him?) the feeling of genuine love of cinema that mean streets (Marty) has. there's a total fuck-you attitude, not just from the subject matter, but from the total creative freedom of it all. it's just a bunch of uber-talented art school students (Marty, Harvey, De Niro) making the movie that they wanted to make, not referencing anything from the past but rather inventing its own grammar. after rewatching it I really want to make something, write something, film something. it makes me feel the youthful energy right off of the screen, the raw talent and love of art. the two most important gangster movies of all time are the godfather and mean streets. the godfather is the elder statesman of crime, a world where family and moral codes matter at least a little bit, and everything is (wonderfully, intricately, and perfectly) planned out and executed with intention like the sistine chapel. mean streets captures the sweat dripping from people's necks, shows the seedy strip clubs and bars where desparate wannabe criminals steal money and blow up mailboxes for kicks; it's created with spontaneity and throwing caution to the wind. criminally (no pun intended) underappreciated for sure, up there with taxi driver, with my fave Scorseses. I would not change a single thing about mean streets. why would you? :))
Scorsese with a twist
what the actually fuck?!?
an italian love letter to film that climaxes like an opera, what a movie!
A little rough around the edges, but obviously hugely influential.
(Typed Review In Progress)
This I wish I had seen so much earlier—around the time it came out, and to have been wiser then than the 10-year-old I was—as the reviews from the time credit Mean Streets with essentially having revolutionized filmmaking. Not that I cannot fathom that academically now, but having lived cinematically pretty much entirely in Mean Streets' wake, seeing it for the first time now is more an exercise than the impactful experience it would have been at its release. Scorsese's seemingly loose narrative, the pick-up-and-go feeling of the camerawork, the grittiness of the setting, characters, and language would undoubtedly have been a bit of a shock to audiences more used to highly polished Hollywood fare at the time, but the style, continually practiced by Scorsese since along with countless other directors he influenced, is not a shock now. The film remains worthwhile viewing on its own, and that's what my star rating reflects, but add another one if viewing the film as a cinema history exercise.
me, running up to martin scorsese: for $1, name a woman
I need someone to love me as much as Martin Scorsese loves using Rolling Stones songs in his movies
“You don't make up for your sins in church. You do it in the streets. You do it at home. The rest is bullshit and you know it.”
The atmosphere is what it needs to be. The entirety of the film feels sleazy, Italian and most importantly mean. For the first 30 minutes, all we get is the atmosphere. The characters live out their everyday life, and this happens so that the audience can get a feel for what it's like to be in the mean streets. These aren't characters that your average joe hangs out with. They're thought of as criminals who want nothing to do with you but to put a bullet in the middle of your eyes. Martin Scorsese wants to put this pre conceived notion to rest, so he opens on a polaroid with home video style text. The inciting incident is introduced early on in the movie, but it's unclear that this will lead anywhere. It feels like everyday speech that the characters say to each-other, it's the equivalent of saying hello and goodbye. The audience feels the atmosphere, and just accepts that what is being said is said all the time. This is the films biggest fault. When we are presented with an inciting incident it doesn't need to be life changing, but it should present a change. It's all breezed over until it needs to come back, and for this it doesn't really feel like you're watching a story unfold. It feels like you're watching a guys mildly entertaining life. Mean Streets has its moments, but in total falls short of being what other Scorsese masterpieces are. A story told in a brilliant fashion, in which the audience gets to feel like they know every character. Mean Streets has the characters, but the story itself needs a little work.
Maybe I made a mistake in watching this so soon after having seen Taxi Driver, or perhaps this movie's reputation set my expectations a bit too high, but I just didn't click with this as much as I'd hoped. It's got strong performances, gorgeous cinematography, and Scorsese's gritty, realistic depiction of life in 1970s New York never ceases to captivate me, but the narrative that fills this grimy setting felt a little flat in my eyes. It moves very glacially, and it doesn't really feel like much of interest is really taking place throughout most of the movie. It could just be those "first viewing blues" setting in, but I don't know. I'll definitely revisit this at some point, as there's still a lot of elements about it that I do like and it's not as though the story is bad, it just didn't draw me in as much as I'd hoped it would the first time around. We'll see if that opinion changes.
Proper title, this. Those streets were very mean!
Dull and difficult to get invested in, this film feels like a *rough* draft of Goodfellas and Casino. Scorsese’s signature direction is there which is nice as always but there’s really nothing crazy here.
Beautiful editing but not the best storyline. Saw this for my film class.
"What's the matter with you? Geet outtaa heeeree"
This film is an important part of who I am, I don’t know what else I can say.
I can't stop swooning over young Harvey Keitel.
Can you imagine seeing this 45 years ago and wondering what everyone involved would do next?
This was a weird one - wacko scene to scene structure (even if I could get my head around the narrative structure overall), sound mix was so shit like people would go from speaking in a studio to speaking on set in one word. Saw Harvey Keitel in Youth like the day before and was interesting to see him be a completely different character, and will probably watch Taxi Driver next to see where De Niro goes to. Soundtrack was really good
Definitely one of the best rewatches of all time for me. I don't even feel like this was the same movie I watched. My eyes have been deceived. This is one of my favorite films of all time. I love literally every single shot of this film so much.
Back when Scorsese had an indie vibe to his work, like a hot-shot new director with potential to be great - but not yet the funding. It's nice to see how resourceful he already was, though. Baby De Niro and Baby Keitel were already great actors. Funny to see how young they were (I'm a millennial, don't judge me) and how much potential they already showed. Mean Streets seems to be the one from which Guy Ritchie draws his inspiration for, like, all of his movies?
Pretty good, I love Scorsese, and while his old films tend to be kind of rough, they have an unique charm to them. One can clearly see the correlation between this and his newer gangster movies (it is fun to see the progress). Robert De Niro is fantastic here. Great soundtrack. Worth a watch.
Holy mother of mercy that was intense
God-tier use of "Rubber Biscuit," "Be My Baby," and "Please Mr. Postman."
Disappointing first half, second half was actually pretty good
Marty Scorsese’s killer music cues, Kent Wakeford’s dreamlike slow-mo and Sidney Levin’s kinetic editing feel like the birth of modern American cinema — but I’m not sure “Mean Streets” is greater than the sum of its innovative parts. 35mm. Museum of Modern Art.
Possibly my favorite Scorsese film. Thoroughly enjoyed it. Surprisingly romantic
Huh so it turns out the meanest streets were the friends we made along the way
Scorsese at his absolute best.
Just as crazy as fuck Love it
Finally saw this one. Fit very well with the Pusher family. Scorcese shows incredible potential, but hasn´t achieved mastery yet.
The groundwork of every Scorsese’s gangster movies to follow. Mean Streets introduced us to the constantly moving and ever chaotic world of street crime and the organized mob as he envisioned. Yet unlike his later, more polished work in the likes of The Goodfellas or Casino, this first entry is raw in every sense of the word. And that sense of rawness is what gave the film it’s genuine quality that Scorsese’s later work may have just missed. The suit and tie smooth talking mafia is sure fun to watch, but the story of two young boys trying to survive in the mean streets of mobster New York - that has it’s own captivating quality.
oh, johnny boy, baby... i still dream of you and that dorky smile of yours
A bit unfocused and roughly cut/edited. Nice to see more of a 'lower' viewpoint and not always the big gangsters though
« What’s the matter with you ?! »   Old New York, De Niro weirdo/gangster. Yeap. ❤️
A classic that teach how to tell a story about the mafia, the old and real mafia, a unique vision of the real gangs of business in Little Italy, accompanied by a wonderful soundtrack all the time.
maybe if the streets were NICE!
85/100 Few filmmakers can boast of a classic like this one being only their third film.
Maybe I would‘ve know what the fuck was going on if I wasn‘t so drunk and in love with De Niro.
punch me for not focusing on the plot 76% of the time.... but I still love you Robert
Every time I get out they PULL ME BACK IN*  *me on movies
Did I even like this ? I don’t know but I loved de Niros mod getup
͞You don't make up for your sins in church. You do it in the streets. You do it at home. The rest is bullshit and you know it.͟ The intro quote of the first truly Martin Scorsese movie. In this movie are all the themes, ambitions, characteristics, sins and obsessions of this master. I see the seed of Casino in the way the chain of power works in the back of the bar. The way Charlie want to become more getting the restaurant is the motivation of Goodfellas. The streets are equally dirt like the New York of Travis Bickle. Even the way of paid penance remained me Silence, a movie of 2017, this movie was premiered in 1973, 44 years between each. In this movie, we see a cinephile mind who has seen everything. The old German directors, all John Ford movies, he watched Red Shoes and Citizen Kane. The French nouvelle vague captivates him. His fellow friend Francis just change everting one year ago with The Godfather and he don’t want to become an exploitation filmmaker. He hit the audience with this powerful imperfect movie. In this very movie he accomplishes two things I consider crucial to understand his career. His master mind of montage and released a force of nature called Robert De Niro. This movie isn´t his finest work. But is the first door to understand this master.
Seemed pretty rough for a Scorcese, a little unfinished. Enjoyed the characters and their interactions.
This isn’t so much a “gangster movie” as it is a film about what it is like to grow up in a gangster environment. Scrocese has always had this ability to make you feel as if you are inside the world his presenting to you, and this is certainly one of those films.  In a strange way, you’re sympathetic to both Charlie and Johnny Boy despite their blatant differences. Charlie is a pragmatist who struggles with the gangster life and his devout Catholicism, whereas Johnny Boy is simply swept up in the life and seems to enjoy it so much that he likes to stir shit up when things get boring. But you understand both the practicality and the boredom, because you get the sense that both men are simply going along with the motions in the only way they know how to.  I would love to see this on the big screen, because the cinematography and the use of the color red are both gorgeous.
De Niro as a livewire maniac saves this for me. Keital is a totally ineffective lead, boring and tonally inconsistent. Found the plotlessness frustrating, it felt like two guys having one argument over and over for two hours.
The beginning dragged out and could have been executed more efficiently. For me at least, the beginning had already set up the characters, the tone, whatever we need to know in terms of story, some artistic moments, and then a whole extra more time that wasn't necessary. The real meat of the film started halfway and got me excited and interested from then on. I wish that the whole hand over fire and religion concept was consistent throughout not only at the beginning and a bit at the end.
The music Elevated the movie even higher for me
I remember the pub I went to the day I first saw this. Well I went there again today and just felt the desire to rewatch my favourite Scorsese. It's flipping been a while, it's insane! Such a masterpiece. The day they release a definitive blu ray/4K is the day I rest easy at night.
This is my 4th or 5th time watching this film and damn, it still holds up very well.
I love how Scorsese uses music, even this early on, and it’s great seeing De Niro and Keitel so young, but I just can’t get into this one.
Ambling and unfocused in that 70's way that sometimes works for me and sometimes really doesn't. Great soundtrack, strong scenes, but it just goes absolutely nowhere, and then it ends and you're like, that's it? You're not going to resolve anything? Every single female character in this movie deserves better.
Getting in a knock-down drag-out pool hall brawl after seeing THE SEARCHERS is *chef’s kiss*
Gritty character study is one of Martin Scorsese's finest achievements. 9.5/10
A pretty solid film with great acting and an explosive ending
What, you call that an ending? You’re just gonna leave me hanging, like I’m some kinda mook? Look, I got outta bed, I put in my two hours just like everybody else. A movie’s gotta have three things, all right? You got the beginning. Then you got the middle. Then you gotta gimme an ending. No ending, no movie, you got me? A real movie, it’s gotta give you some closure. Like you have a big wedding, or you win the big game, or you kill the, whaddaya call it, you kill the Predator. It’s like my Uncle Jerry, you know him, he got hammered at his daughter’s wedding, but he insisted on giving the toast. He told this joke; it had a rabbi, it had a priest, it had a shoe salesman, it had everybody, it went on for forty-five minutes, swear to God. Right before the punchline, he sits down. Can you believe that? He just sits down, falls asleep. I tell him later, Uncle Jerry, you got to tell me the rest of the joke. What happened to the rabbi, the priest, the shoe salesman, you got to tell me the punchline. You know what he says? He says, What joke? He swears he don’t know no jokes about no shoe salesman, can’t even remember giving his daughter away. You got any idea how frustrating that is, thinking about that joke? My cousin, she just celebrated her tenth wedding anniversary, but me, I’m still wondering what happened to the rabbi. I’m gonna forgive ya this time, Marty, on account you got good pathos. But when you make Mean Streets 2, and I’m talking yesterday, it better pick right up where this left off, all right?
atmosphere
It's not very common that I get really excited about something I see as pioneering or before its time, especially when I think I've seen the techniques used more effectively by something more modern, but I found myself pretty much in awe of some of Scorsese's camera work here. Particularly the way the camera movement was syncing up with the actors and how kinetically the camera moved when showing Keitel's drunkenness. The story is a pretty interesting and grounded take on gangster-ism. It's place in the genre is pretty interesting to me, both as an early predecessor to Goodfellas and as a film coming a year after the Godfather. As a direct response to the later this more grounded and much grittier take on the life of the gangster is an interesting contrast to the cleaner and more operatic tone of Coppola's classic.
i love the setting, the acting. the story is kind of a mess though. really interesting watch. the shots mixed with awesome music. the hints of something special to come.
Though messy, this is an early success for Scorsese, who begins laying the groundwork for his greatest hits and establishes himself as a unique and wildly fresh new voice. Here, Scorsese is transitioning out of his Who's That Knocking At My Door nouvelle vague worship into his more trademark crime stories about toxic masculinity and American mythology. A very young Robert De Niro gives a fantastic performance only matched by the camera itself, which has all the freedom in the world, moving deftly through fight scenes and shouting matches between tough guys. Paired with doo wop and Rock'n'Roll tunes, it makes for a stylistically invigorated film much ahead of its time.
nice hester street great pulls
Not what i expected for sure. A treat to watch though. Italian American shit, Madonne.
tfw you make a film about mobsters titled “Mean Streets” that's mostly people hanging out and shit. but actually, this streets ARE kinda mean: it's easier to fuck people over than to take care of them, even when you got a little bit of power (and maybe specially so, because of just how big of a deal appearences are!) sometimes his (excellent) use of music feels like he's overcompensating tho
Mean Streets is often overlooked in Scorsese's filmography. It doesn't have the legions of fans behind Taxi Driver and Raging Bull or even the cult success of (the massively underrated) The King of Comedy. I love these films (especially The King of Comedy) but it was Mean Streets that kick started my love for Scorsese. This picture has a looser narrative than Scorsese's other work, incorporating an ensemble cast of characters dealing with their trials on the streets. Our main man Charlie (a young hood played by Harvey Keitel), tries to balance his friendships, romance and mafia life while also dealing with issues of faith and lust. This broad spectrum of ideas and characters may turn some people off, but the freedom Scorsese has within this narrative leads to scenes of unbounded energy and creativity: look at the now infamous red lighting used in the bar to exude an alluring sense of looming danger; notice the use of jump-cuts and romanticised close-ups in the introduction of Teresa (this scene paying a heavy tribute to Breathless); awe at the permeating fun of the "mook" brawl where handheld action is actually done properly. No other Scorsese movie has this level of experimentation. The freeform shape of the plot begins to fall into place when Johnny Boy's debts to Michael start to stack up. Scorsese is known for his pressure-cooker tension building and Johnny Boy acts as the foil to set this in motion. Robert De Niro plays the role with an unhinged aura (similar to that of Scorsese's cinematography) to command a fascinating screen presence. This guy really knows how to pick worthwhile characters, highlighting the tragic depths of a lonely man who has lost control of his life. Maybe Charlie (who so desperately wants control in his own life) sees himself in Johnny Boy. Maybe Charlie just wants to help him because he's in love with Johnny's sister. Regardless, their love-hate relationship continually intertwines throughout the narrative. Harvey Keitel and Bobby D have a complicated chemistry on screen that is frustrated and raw. They provide the emotional core to the movie that looks set to send our beloved Charlie down the street of despair. Charlie deserves to be recognised as one of Scorsese's most compelling characters. While his outward pressures are obvious to see there is also an internal battle he is fighting with himself. He feels ashamed for his sexual fantasies with a black woman, perhaps commenting on his sexual insecurity (as suggested in the sex scene with Teresa where he peeks through his fingers like a Peeping Tom). He also feels uncomfortable with committing to Teresa, refusing to start a proper life with her in order to please his uncle (with whom he also feels inadequate). Scorsese also sprinkles in some religious sequences in which Charlie struggles with his commitment to religion itself, contemplating his relationship with God. The only control he has over any of his relationships is his friendship with Johnny. A friendship which is set to send shockwaves through his life. Scorsese is known to pack a punch of staggering energy in his climaxes and Mean Streets might be his most viscerally powerful. The violent subtext boils and explodes into a beautifully intricate chaos of failure as Charlie finally loses the last inkling of control from his life. Johnny Boy runs down a dark alley, injured and alone, in a scene almost identical to that of Breathless' closing sequence. Teresa's hand limps from the shattered windshield. Charlie kneels by the broken fire hydrant soaked by the millions of water molecules littering the sidewalk. He thinks of his uncle and the black stripper, knowing that his multiple endeavors in life are about to collide. Charlie has been defeated by the Mean Streets. In the apartments high above these streets, locals close their blinds for another night of dreaming.
They are
Scorcese is a great director and you can tell the origins of some of his later movies in this. There are a lot of scene that feel genuine and pull you in. The characters are likeable, and the situations are relatable. However the film is all over the place in terms of plot and doesnt come to a satisfying conclusion. 63/100
I must've missed something here. Paid attention the entire film and can't figure out what happened or what the film was about.
Everything about this was intimate and dizzying and dirty and truthful and brilliant. No one can make a movie like Scorsese.
Mean Streets shows that Scorsese's skill with a camera was there from the beginning, but that his touch with a narrative needed some more time. These sort of street criminals have such inherently dramatic lives, it does not take much to find their drama, which both hurts and helps the film.
"Violence floated in and out of our lives like the music we heard on the streets." - Martin Scorsese Boy he sure is Catholic.
If you want to watch a master director laying the foundation for decades of greatness, watch this movie. Yet another reminder that De Niro is, and always, will be, the Man.
This isn't a film you'll enjoy on its own merits if you've watched a lot of Scorsese, but much like Spielberg's Amblin, it's fun to watch a young director slowly grow into their particular tics and habits as a filmmaker and a lot of that is already there. The slow boom in to one of Scorsese's favorite songs, the aggressive camera movement, the toxic masculinity and the Catholic guilt. Quite a bit of it is already there. It's an inconsequential thing, but it wasn't back then. Such a narrative back then was damn near revolutionary, and that's worth remembering. You can watch a very young Robert De Niro and Harvey Keitel and see the raw talent they had before they compromised themselves, and see just how goddamn good they can be. It's a masterclass in microexpressions with the both of them. Scorsese wouldn't hit peak form until Taxi Driver, but in hindsight, it seems almost inevitable that he would.
Letterboxd: We’ve got a movie you cannot say no to. Me: No. Letterboxd: ...He said no.
Yes, I hate films with extreme violence, toxic masculinity, racism, misogyny, and homophobia. Yes, I love Mean Streets and consider it my ultimate comfort movie. We exist 😔
Came in when David Carradine got shot while just trying to drunkenly have a squirt. And... Of course I have to watch it to the end.
literally all of charlie’s problems would’ve been solved if johnny’s disaster gay bitchass would just shut the fuck up (i wish i could be spared of the casual racism but this is what happens when you watch 70’s mob films!) (i would unapologetically let harvey keitel bend me over a table ngl)
I am a little flumix why I had not seen this movie yet. In many ways it was like seeing a rosetta stone and seeing how film DNA has intwined and melded together over the last 45 years. Okay, I'm not entirely sure those two metaphores worked together but you get what I mean. And it's not just what Taratino did with it in the 90s, more how with this third movie Scorsese shaped movies in general. It's in very board strokes and part of a larger indepentant movement that was already happened in the early 70s. But you take this movie out of film history and it looks very different. I always knew how important Scorsese was, now I see him in a very differentent light and how this movie has never really let him go. I get that Goodfellas (a movie I adore, and I will generally drop what I am doing and watch it if I come across it - where's the money Karen) is a more polished more drawn out epic version of Mean Streets. Watching Mean Streets, I kept on wondering what would have happened if Keitel had De Niro's career. Cause Keitel is giving everything he has in this movie, and I mean everything. I don't think anyone else could have played Jake LaMottam, but Travis Bickle, maybe Jimmy Conway (though I will give maybe too similar in body shape to Pesci, small and weasely). Personally I just found it odd that is was De Niro that really popped. Maybe because you maybe see to much of Keitel's work on the page as it were. Anyway I really liked the movie.
Johnny Boy is slightly underwritten, I think, but man, De Niro doesn’t let that get in the way of anything. Wow.
“Wuzzuh madda wit’ chu?” The only dialog Scorsese likes more than the F Bomb. The first really poorly made Scorsese film I’d seen. I was hoping if Goodfellas was his pulp fiction this would be his reservoir dogs, but that’s not it. If Goodfellas is a really good movie with some scenes in a bar, this is just a film set in a bar. The moral of this story is don’t help those who can’t help themselves. That’s really evident. I don't think anybody else is saying that though, which is confusing to me. De Niro is the one who can't help himself. He is without redemption. He is neither competent nor likable in any way. You can tell De Niro is no good from his opening intro. We get a quick scene of him blowing up a mailbox and running away, ‘Johnny Boy’ appears on screen then it cuts somewhere else. It's really jarring that we had such a brief scene to introduce a champion like De Niro. What's up, Scorsese, you couldnt build that into something else? But the intro does its job: I know there is nothing redeeming about this character. Keitel keeps sticking up for De Niro, the film never explicitly states why, and the film seems to punish him at the end for his altruism. There isn't enough else to go on. That's clearly the point of the movie. I dont know what Keitel wants in this film. His uncles restaurant is clearly a macguffin and he doesnt want Teresa. When Keitel has his character introduced hes fantasizing about a black dancer at the bar, who he sets up a date with later. He chickens out right before the date, but has visions of her again at the end of the film. She clearly represents something he wants, but not enough (I think she represents something anti-Italian). It seems like he wants De Niro, but its not clear why. It never seems sexual, but maybe im missing that facet. Otherwise, he's just being Catholic and trying to protect De Niro, which the film punishes him for. So that's the point of the film. It's actually slightly anti-Catholic, in that it punishes Keitel for trying to do something in line with his faith. The film is full of sexist, racist, homophobic, unlikable characters with huge scenes dedicated to establishing those character traits. Its tough to make a good movie out of unlikable characters and this film doesnt succeed. These character traits also arent important in any way. That definitely counts as a weakness. Theres one good bar fight in this movie, but there are so many other bad ones that ive already forgotten why it was good. This is basically 'Bar Fight' the movie. Scorsese has impeccable taste in music, but when totally unrestrained in selection, as in this film, it starts to lose meaning. The music so saturated this film that the audience stops thinking about it. It becomes a distraction. It distracts to the point where you’d like to say to someone “can you turn down the music? I’m trying to watch a movie”. This film has is also indulgent in establishing shots. The exteriors of the bar are never necessary, I know it’s the bar, the whole movie is set there. I get that Scorsese loves NYC as much as anyone but there’s no good reason to have as many generic shots in an already bloated run time. Another example is the opening of the movie with a couple seconds of a guy getting out of bed before cutting to the credits. That was completely unnecessary, unmoving imagery when you could have just started with credits. The bloated run time is not assisted by extremely repetitive dialog. Also unimaginative dialog. Some of these lines are meant to be clever, but they aren’t. Like when Keitel offers up a prayer, and the others mock him, saying “you talking to yourself?” And laughing. This line isn’t worth including, and its not a funny way to establish that no one else shares his faith. And considering how important his faith is to him this is too late to establish no one else believes. Not to mention in this scene we keep careening between dialog in the car to establishing shots of driving. I can’t imagine a worse more boring way of handling this.
Early Scorsese films like this just have a raw, honest and tightly instinctive feel to them. I like it a lot!
de niro invented acting
Only watched this cos Arctic Monkeys sing about it and I’ll slightly disappointed in my boyfriend, Alex Turner, for making such a vague reference
This has such an awesome, kinetic energy to it that I haven’t really seen in other Scorsese films. Rather than use a structured narrative like Goodfellas or Casino to tell its story, Mean Streets is incredibly free-form and uses this to its advantage, when conflict happens it almost always hits you right over the head because the structure of this film constantly keeps bouncing around, and while that might not be some people’s cup of tea (as they might see this as unfocused or amateur) I absolutely loved it.
What a boring fucking movie. IMDb describes this being about a guy who's trying to work his way up in the ranks of the mob, but I didn't get that at all, it seemed to be more about Harvey Keitel as an uninteresting plain guy with a bad friend who borrows too much money (which I guess is supposed to be the main character arc?) and an uninteresting side plot involving some broad. I barely made it through
What a powerful debut for Scorsese. His incredible use of music and the huge performances by DeNiro and Keitel make this film a must-see.
This is the movie where de niro takes acting to a whole new level. Also 10 DOLLAS
Sometimes, I feel like Martin Scorsese's ability to compose a scene sometimes takes precedence over his ability to meaningfully and seamlessly connect one scene to the next. Don't get me wrong, he's fantastic at composing scenes, and Mean Streets, but there's a tendency in some of his films, now evidently precedent from his first features to the likes of The Wolf of Wall Street and Silence, to come across as more of a montage of similar events under the guise of a character study, an approach which works incredibly well in certain circumstances, less so in others, but never outright bad. Scorsese is exceptional at narrowing the scope of his films to converge around his characters. He creates environments in which the world literally does revolved around them, so by default, they become the most fascinating aspects of his films. The camera follows closely behind them as they move from place to place, circles around them with a predator-like fixation during action scenes, and there's a shot in Mean Streets, a steadicam shot of Harvey Keitel's face as drunkenly stumbles around a party, that is almost impossibly good. His use of music is quite frankly all the context he needs; Such is the skill and precision with which he implements it. When Mean Streets has this sight, it's great, but the unfortunate reality is that it doesn't have this sight at all times. The alternating focus on Charlie Cappa and Johnny Boy feels like two different movies occasionally converging rather than a single film with two main characters. The film isn't presented in such a way that the dual narratives could be considered part of the point, and it creates occasions where a particularly exceptional scene focused on one of the characters is interrupted by a more stagnant scene taking place between both of them. (High) 7 / 10 - Good
Love the relationship between Johnny-boy and Charlie, it really brings an original element to what could otherwise be an orthodox Scorsese gangster flick (although on a much more personal and minuscule scale).
I’m too gay to appreciate these Scorsese movies.
Although DeNiro's performance does shine through, especially in the final act, and it does set the pace for the rest of Scorsese's iconic filmography, "Mean Streets" is still an early film from a young writer/director, and it shows. From the messy writing to the wildly spastic pacing of the film, it shows too many cracks for me to truly recommend it as a "good" film rather than something important to see, because it show's that even master filmmakers have rough and humble beginnings. It's "Baddabing: The Movie", and is pretty much the Boondock Saints of the 70s
Just because it's authentic to the toxic, alcoholic 1970's NYC asshole experience doesn't mean it's good. Tell me with a straight face that the racist, homophobic ugliness is essential to verisimilitude and understanding "what it was really like" when the bulk of the movie was shot in Los Angeles.
Why was this rated R18+?
Mean Streets is a strong debut Scorsese, with two great central performances from DeNiro and Keitel. It's always really great to see a director establish themselves so early on in their career, and Scorsese definitely does that here, with amazing frantic camera work constantly at play, especially in one bar fight scene. I have to say though, it takes a really long time for Mean Streets to establish its characters and their relationships, it's a great conclusion but the setup is far too long, still a really strong debut from Scorsese.
Birth Year Challenge - #9 of 45 We've all had that one friend that will drag you down with them if you don't cut them the f**k loose. As per the rules, this was my first time watching this from start to finish. Hard to believe it turns 45 next month. You can clearly see the foundations of what Scorsese would build his career on. Give him a better budget, more editing skills, and some improved sound mixing, and you have a film that fits in perfectly with Good Fellas and Casino. Since I've never really been around that culture or even in New York, I gotta ask how genuine the performances are. Help me out, folks: sincere or scenery chewing? Tell me in the comments.
The most blatantly "early" film of maybe any director I've watched. There's moments of excellence here, particularly in the latter half. Keitel and De Niro really carry the film, as do most of the supporting stuff; there's a great, light sense of flowing dialogue throughout the film. It just feels like a bunch of guys shooting the stuff, so to speak, for a while, and it's entertaining just by itself. But the first half alone suffers from some technical limitations - the film feels cheap every other or maybe every third scene, and it feels bizarre every time. The camerawork feels just very inexperienced, and the cast can't carry everything on their own. There's some nicer stuff in the 2nd half, but the movie ultimately falls short of reaching its potential due to Scorcese's inability to really drive home theme. There's some clear elements going on here - the constant music/movie motif, the catholic repentance bit, there's ideas here that just remain ideas. By the end of the film, I don't truly feel like much happened, and I don't feel like what did happen holds much significance. I don't even get that Coen brothers type sense of nihilism, just incompletion.
The earliest of his movies I have seen yet, and definitely a rough diamond. The performances are excellent. The music as usual is used perfectly. The cinematography is surreal. But it didn't grab me immediately like the rest of Scorsese's films. I also understand the time period but don't like the racism or the unnecessary scene full of homophobia. De Niro is fucking captivating.
"You don't make up for your sins in church. You do it in the streets. You do it at home. The rest is bullshit and you know it."  Mean Streets was actually Martin Scorsese's third feature film. I'm a humongous Martin Scorsese fan and I've loved almost all his films. Unfortunately, this falls in the "almost" of his feature films. There's nothing bad about this film at all. The performances are all fantastic with a both very young Harvey Keitel and Robert de Niro. My main issue was that the film didn't really feel necessary. The entire time, for me, it felt like there was nothing of importance really happening. The score also felt recycled a lot throughout the film. The cinematography is to die for though, and I'm a huge sucker for nighttime, crime thrillers. Besides a few great scenes though, I honestly found this to be more on the mediocre side of Scorsese's filmography.
“Honorable men go with honorable men”  Decent movie. Worse than “Resevoir Dogs”, obviously. Wouldn’t necessarily recommend to anybody, but might serve to be interesting for some.
Certainly an improvement from his previous work. But I'm also starting to think maybe I'm just not a huge Scorsese fan??
Decently made film containing some good acting, writing and directing with not that much else to offer. I seem to not like the old-school Martin Scorcese style. It’s just my personal preferance and I do see a well made film in this. It’s the last Scorcese film from this era I’ll be checkingout for the foreseeable future.
Martin Scorsese — Ranked Movies I've Seen on FilmStruck "The pain in hell has two sides. The kind you can touch with your hand; the kind you can feel in your heart... your soul, the spiritual side." Martin Scorsese dabbles in themes that will soon become some of his trademark ones in this early gem, a film that kicked off his wonderful relationship with Robert DeNiro and set the tone for the gangster and gritty classics that he would soon produce. Mean Streets has all the makings of a Scorsese picture most people know and love: The exquisite use of music (Johnny Boy's entrance to the club with "Jumpin' Jack Flash" playing stands out as a particularly memorable choice), flashes of creative editing and stark violence all with the familiar backdrop of the seedy side of New York City. Harvey Keitel provides the heart and soul of this movie while DeNiro is the bravado and aggression. Scorsese kind of frames this movie as a dirty, messy sort of tragedy and struggle for the redemption of the criminal soul and it works in many ways. Here, we have common Scorsese thematic tropes such as male friendships/male bonding, the criminal psyche, men (particularly young men) behaving badly and the consequences of their actions and the role of violence and its effect on masculinity in an urban setting. They're themes Scorsese has revisited many times throughout his career but Mean Streets represents an early film where Scorsese experiments in this territory and he elicits very effective performances among the ensemble of this film, particularly Kettle's tortured protagonist who is almost numb to the pain his life of crime is inflicting on him internally. DeNiro's absence in the middle section of the film puts the focus squarely on Keitel, which detracts from the film's momentum a bit, but Scorsese uses it to probe deeper into the character of Keitel's Charlie, the result being a sort of sneaky character study the way Scorsese has shown us in some of his greatest films. The film never reaches the intensity that makes the first act so electric and powerful but the film as a whole never peters out, either, it simply looks more inward and gets a bit darker until its ending, tragic climax. Throughout, Scorsese explores the dark alleys of Manhattan and the boozy clubs and bars the characters operate in, giving the film a gritty quality that the best filmmakers of the 1970s gave to their films.
This is the first Scorsese film to truly start to feel like a Scorsese film. Up til now his previous works had the makings, but just didn’t have that signature essence to it that all of his films have. The camera work and editing are amazing and fluid, the characters feel deep and real, the acting is fantastic especially from Keitel and a young De Niro, and the whole thing just feels very personal and genuine. Still a little rough around the edges, but probably Scorsese’s first really great film.
Really good character work, superb writing and energetic neorealist cinematography make this a winner for me. Very personal feeling and subjective. The editing really elevates it as well, it is clearly a very influential crime film and my initial impression is that it is the first quintessential synthesis of Scorsese.
The story is a little messy, but Scorsese's signatures are all in place - the sleek nighttime grit and glow of NYC, the ultraviolence, the stunning music choices. I really enjoyed this. Somewhere above 3.5 stars, below 4 stars.
Early Scorsese. I found it pretty nice. The story was a lil' messy imo, I got lost a few times. Anyways, great perfomances by De Niro and Keitel. De Niro was fucking hilarious.
Whats better than this? Guys being dudes
It's the second best movie to have Robert De Niro being shot in the neck in the last 5 minutes.
I don't exactly remember when I first saw this film, it must've been 3 or 4 years ago, but I do remember being disappointed and have since considered it to be my least favorite Scorsese film. Looking back, I don't really blame myself. At first glance, Mean Streets is a relatively plotless and at times amateurish crime drama mostly consisting of a bunch of Italian-American punks getting into fist-fights in Manhattan. But upon this rewatch, I've found that, of course, the film hasn't changed yet I have. The first time I saw Mean Streets, I had never walked the filthy streets of Manhattan, been to bars, owed people money, had a falling out with a friend, had relations with a girl, or even been to the Feast of San Gennaro in Little Italy. But no longer. I've had those experiences since, and have also grown to understand my Italian-American heritage through my own filmmaking. I empathize with Charlie, especially as of late, because he and I share the thematic thread prevalent in not only this film but a handful of Scorsese's work - Catholic guilt. Even a lapsed Catholic cannot evade its haunting presence; I'm not sure it ever goes away. However, Charlie's struggle to atone for his sins in a meaningful way for himself while preserving his personal morals surrounded by the Italian American community's toxic masculinity is a balancing act which is which is too damn relatable for me. This is a rare film which looks and feels all too real to me.
35mm at Film Forum NYC First time I've seen a movie projected on film, and this movie has a reallyyyyyy cool look. Love the long takes and interesting angles like the drunk scene. Wish they had done more with the "pay for your sins in the streets idea," which intrigued me the most and I think could have been built on more. I was really tired during this so I might want to rewatch at some point.
"You don't make up for your sins in church. You do it in the streets. You do it at home. The rest is bullshit and you know it. "  Robert De Niro and Martin Scorsese are the greatest director actor pairing cinema has seen or will ever see. They've made so many masterpieces, and this film started it all. Mean Streets stars De Niro alongside Harvey Keitel in the gritty, brutal, and dangerous New York City crime world, where you don't want to mess with the wrong people. This movie boasts one of Keitel's finest performances and an incredible soundtrack, just to name some of it. The vibes I got from this movie were unlike any other I've felt before, honestly once I rewatch it enough, I can see myself enjoying this more than Taxi Driver, my favorite Scorsese movie and my second (but honestly probably first) favorite movie of all time. Stop what you're doing and do yourself a favor and watch this, it'll be worth it. (Sorry I went on a lot I just really loved it I may have overhyped it lol)
damn those streets sure are mean
Watching from the 21st century, Mean Streets feels dated and a little strange. However, it still possesses a certain charm and we see the makings of the Scorsese to come, particularly evident in the scenes with tracking shots.
probably catch me at the bar trying to start a fight
Mean Streets is Scorsese before Scorsese was at his best. It's an indictment of the violent, depraved core that rumbles deep in the centre of toxic masculinity. Some people argue that Mean Streets glorifies this lifestyle, and I completely disagree. I think it's clear that Scorsese is criticising the life of these violent, petty wannabe mafiosos . I believe these critics are conflating glorification with Scorsese's presentation of a nuanced, multi-dimensional perspective that eschews the reductive dichotomy of only good and evil. By portraying the film through this perspective, the villains in this story are 'humanised' to an extent - and I think this is what makes Mean Streets a great film. Also A+ for the esoteric soundtrack.
Ayy, that’s pretty good! The cast was a really nice line-up and overall the movie was enjoyable.
Had a blast watching this movie and De Niro gives a finest performance like usual. I also enjoyed Harvey Keitel in this
A masterpiece in style, if not substance, and has some downright incredible tracking shots. Scorsese frames this film so excellently that the sub-par, and honestly kind of boring plot is a backseat to the frantic and expressive camera style. It should be noted that while I say I find the plot boring, all the acting is superb from the two leads, Harvey Keitel and Robert De Niro. Scorsese has a great color palette on this film too, and it always has this gritty hard nosed feel no matter where the characters are taken. There were also many instances of clear inspiration from French New Wave in many of the long shots and street view angles of New York City.
oh we love some good marty scorsese masculine melodrama but also frankie bones
Always a dark joy to watch. Classic Scorsese greatness.
You can see that Martin Scorsese was just starting to figure things out in “Mean Streets” — a tale of low class gangsters living in sin. The film is fascinating and has brilliant sparks, but it’s obviously lacking compared to the director’s later classics. The same could be said about Robert De Niro and Harvey Keitel, who play an explosive hot head and an implosive catholic. Scorsese finds more use for the both of them as he goes forward in his career. One aspect of “Mean Streets” that works as well as any of Scorsese’s later works is the Doo-Wop vinyl soundtrack, especially in the scenes in Little Italy dive bars where the music sounds like it's bursting out of a rusty jukebox. Those scenes, soaked in crimson light, put the viewer authentically in the core of this environment. It all feels so real and so subterranean, but again Scorsese was still just figuring it all out.
oh charlie......whatever you do, you will always be a sinner......
"You don't make up for your sins in church. You do it in the streets. You do it at home. The rest is bullshit and you know it." A pure distillation of visceral thrills and religious pre-occupation. The Catholic imagery mixed with Harvey Keitel need for a personal relationship with God, oddly protestant concern for Martin Scorsese. It is a beautifully acted film with a script edging on profundity. Harvey Keitel's Charlie is probably the most recognisable human within Martin Scorsese whole canon of film, his inability to make everything the way he wants it to be. While Johnnie Boy is the idiot we all have met, the mercurial arsehole. Someone who just cannot follow the rules, the infuriating self-destructive individual. Mean Streets is as kinetic, exciting and majestic as cinema gets. It is I Vitelloni repurposed for New York, it is low-level mafia, more focused on soul than at any point in Scorsese' career. People went crazy for The Wolf of Wall Street, and it is a good film, but that always felt like Scorsese reaching for a world he did not quite live and breathe. Mean Streets is a howl of a film, straight from the gut. Mean Streets is the dropped note in Be My Baby; it is Paragons singing Florence; it is the fight in the pool hall scored to Please Mr Postman. It is Harvey Keitel burning his fingers; his internal monologue. It is Jeannie Bell dancing. Mean Streets is Robert De Niro strolling into the bar; delivering monologues like he cannot remember the words. It is dancing around a car. It is Joey Scallops. Joey Clams. And wha'. Still the best film Martin Scorsese has made. But then, it is just about the best film anyone has ever made.
Keitel and De Niro were EXCELLENT. You can tell how Scorsese began to get creative with his shots. Loved the one where Keitel is drunk and the camera stumbles with him around the club while a pop song plays. As always the music selection is perfect. I wish the plot was more interesting.
Damn, early Scorsese is wonderful.
┳┻| ┻┳| ┳┻| ┻┳| ┳┻| ┻┳| ┳┻| ┻┳| ┳┻| ┻┳| ┳┻| ┻┳| ┳┻| _ ┻┳| •.•) This is a better film ┳┻|⊂ﾉ than Goodfellas ┻┳|
Besides the sparkling performances of Keitel and De Niro, two details make this one really special: 1. the soundtrack. Rolling Stones and the finest pieces of Neapolitan music is a match hard to beat. It shouldn't work, but it does 2. the Italian spoken in the film. It's Italian, not the stereotyped Italoamericano usually heard in movies. I've appreciated it a lot
so i'd really like the coast scene where charlie and teresa tried to work things out, and the scenes where jonny boy losing it, great three, but then i guess i wasn't really concentrating / not really know where to look at, so maybe i watch it some other day in the future, or not. and what an amazing career... scorsese, keitel and de niro. i am in awe (while reflecting on the meaning of life and time and if time is ruthless or a gift, if time is a mean street).
As one of Scorsese's first features, it's clear to see he's still finding his feet. The tone is all over the place and there's too much effort put into strange editing and disjointed story-telling. Dated as it is, this feels like the experiment Scorsese had to make to figure out a few things before making Taxi Driver. There's some good wise-guy banter, and Harvey Keitel is excellent. It's all just a bit too messy and tried too hard in a lot of ways. It's missing the weight and masterful execution of his later work, but still an interesting step along the way.
Great, great film, with some great Early Robert De Niro, who had just come fresh off The Godfather Part II. The ending ends without the main characters having a real conclusion - it’s a bit hard to say what it is, but it works strangely. This is probably my second favorite Martin Scorsese film after GoodFellas. 9/10
[thick Italian accent] hey whAT 'YA DOINg
The performances and the camera work in this film make up for everything. DeNiro is wonderful as Johnny Boy, keeping the audience entertained with his attitude. Keitel is great as Charlie, the compromiser and confidante of DeNiro and his relationship between him and Robinson is pure and greatly developed. The camera work done in the bar fight scene was so well-done and effective. Not Scorsese's best but still a great film.
young de niro is magical but this film is very clunky
A proof-of-concept for Taxi Driver and a showcase for De Niro.
I ain’t smart I’m stupid
It kind of meanders around. Lots of good scenes driven by jukebox tracks.  Young Deniro looks like Chris Meloni (law and order guy)
Robert de Niro is fantastic and Harvey Keitel gives a great performance in a great movie.
Yup, those streets sure are mean. First off, to paraphrase Hillary Duff, that intro sequence is "what dreams are made of". Not only do we immediately get a sense of each of the characters and their relationships, but we're also drawn into their world as an equal. The fake documentary style reminds a lot of people of home movies and, hoo boy, what a lovely yet horrible home dynamic. I adopted all these characters and I'm also dreading the family reunion. So many of the shots invigorate the acting. I don't think there was a single brawl where I was apathetic to the consequences (unless another character felt that way). Not only did the fights feel important, but other short sequences reinforced the narrative. This isn't a spoiler because it's literally just someone walking, but here me out. A character's nervous about impending consequences. How is this shot? Walking down a darkened street with the blinds of a nearby window serving as the main light source. He's shuffling along, keeping closer to walls than other passersby and he throws a paranoid look over his shoulder. That is so clever! We've got jail cell allusions in lighting, we know how he's feeling, we know he's not used to this, and we know he feels alone. Listen. No one asked this movie to be this smart: it just was. My only warnings are for the obvious things. It's a gangster movie made in the 70s. There's violence, nudity, profanity, and a heck of a lot of racism/homophobia. There are also a couple religious themes portrayed in a meh light? Sometimes, I found the racism/homophobia to be superfluous because it felt like an unnecessary side story, but eh. The streets are mean: I was warned. Watch it if you're into family bonding, sucky (but understandable) things happening, and good ol' gangster movies. Now you've been warned, ya mook.
Harvey Keitel & Robert De Niro play an Italian-American version of Noel & Liam Gallagher.
Do not be thrown by the glorious, dizzying kitsch of the film, this is a very complex portrait of a woman but also the social structures surrounding this woman (and most women). Biller is one of those directors like Todd Haynes where I am in love with the craft of their filmmaking, but also feel like I could write a long dissertation of the ideas and themes of the movie.
dvd, overall unsettling rating: 4/5  She's one of the best!
Viva has that same magical appeal of finding a time capsule, but instead of just finding things from the past this film interjects it’s own agenda and it’s great.  The film follows Biller as the lead Viva who is a young woman that wants more out of life then just her overly occupied husband and her circuit of friends that she rapidly grows bored of.  Once she leaves her husband Viva falls prey of all the strange flower children that are balls deep in the sexual revolution.  Biller displays an insanely vast amount of detail in every scene, the costumes look great, the home decor is straight from this era, and the one piece that really got me was the hairstyles.  Really great all around.
Checked this out as really enjoyed The Love Witch last year. Really liked it, even if the clearly low-budget means there are parts that are a little clunky. Biller is great and looking forward to what she does next, hopefully won't be as big a gap between her second and third.
I'm not smart enough for this movie.
Some scenes, I laugh out loud. Other scenes evoke a deep dread or discomfort. Anna Biller is a genius. It’s exciting to see this directorial debut, predating her masterpiece, THE LOVE WITCH.
This is the problem with trying to be hip. You take the titles from the Mary Tyler Moore show, and add Paul Lynde and various campy plotlines, and you get a deliberately unfunny mess that is supposed to be ironic.
A little bit too much winking to the audience for my tastes, but the film does a very good job in its recreation of the films it is satirising/giving tribute to/parodying/condemning/praising in many ways (especially the look/style), apart from in its duration, which goes on far too long to not get stale.
I was going to attempt watching all of Anna's filmography today but to be completely honest, I don't think I possibly can. I'm not saying that because this movie was bad, I'm saying that because this movie was A LOT. Like, I just ate a four course meal. Seriously, this movie is SO absurd that it puts into perspective IMPORTANT topics such as feminism, sexual liberation, gender roles, and more. Anna Biller has really created a gem of a movie and I can't wait to indulge in the rest of her creations--But first, a glass of water. LOL.
Biller's first feature comes off like a grand ode to the influences and style. Through sheer force of talent, it's difficult to imagine any current filmmaker working within a particular milieu and be able to approximate a pinpoint interpretation so effectively. Again, the unique nature of approaching through production design and disciplined mannerisms here are the key. Taking nods from 60's exploitation and new wave is one thing; visually approximating it to a tee is pure technique. At two hours, it certainly falters from a lack of big picture focus - a tight 80-90 to the genre conventions would have solidified this. But when you get a white horse for your picture, the fuck if you are not going to use it type of thing. The amount of work done here: the animation, the songs, starring, editing, design, and probably ten other jobs... with no budget, yet still such precise detail. The Love Witch would go on to solidify the aptitude of this particular filmmaker but if this isn't pure viva filmmaking, I don't know what is.
this. is. super genius I have no more words
“There has never been a better time to be a man.” Well shit. What a serious fucking movie. Honest to god bizarre but effective as some kind of sick, silly, descent into sex in suburbia. A throwback. An indictment. A fucking insanely successful piece of pulp that simaltaneously deconstructs the Inherent maleness of the exact kind of pulp it’s parodying. All the more amazing that it somehow sustains itself while trafficking in the same exact thematic and aesthetic territory for two full hours. I now worship at the altar of Anna Biller. Despite the worry that it might indicate some falsity as far as my credibility as woke may go, I can’t help but compare her to Richard Kelly. Though his instincts often lead him more to speed up than stretch out (with the exception of his film that mostly closely resembles the work of Biller; The Box), he has the same natural knack for establishing rhythms through eery editing, sharp characterization, and really strong filmmaking too bold for a mere mortal to comprehend on their very first viewing. I adore this shit. One of those films that makes you wish you didn’t ever have to blink. Viva la Viva!
Completely adore Anna Biller since I got interested in her feminist ideals and film making inspirations which puts me in the loop on the weirdness and style of her movies. This is a full blown female fantasy with nothing held back and I was into it.
Reminiscent of Russ Meyer and John Waters films, Anna Biller’s feature film debut is charming, beautiful to look at and has some very genuine laugh out loud moments. You can really see the craftsmanship Biller puts into her films, as she does many of the key roles herself. Just like with The Love Witch, I had a little issue with the run time. The first few scenes where characters laugh a little too much at their jokes, go on for too long, but once it gets going, it’s an easy film to watch and enjoy. This is a modern day sexploitation film that could’ve easily been a third installment in the Grindhouse series, and I will always like and appreciate films like that.
I respect and support Anna Biller 100% as an artist a feminist and a filmmaker but there were some parts of this that just didn't work
☁️ the dreamiest of films & agnes was the dreamiest of girls ☁️
Man, I adored The Love Witch, but I'm struggling with this one. It is patently too long, for one thing, and I feel like it keeps landing right in that weird space between 'are you satirizing/deconstructing/commenting on this Thing or are you just doing this Thing,' especially in the way the plot just bounds from incident to incident without a ton of cohesion. And I am really finding it hard to get past the multiple (!!!) scenes of sexual assault that are literally never commented on or analyzed at all -- knowing Biller's work and aims as I do, I knew those scenes weren't just tossed in for no reason (or for comedy) and had a distinctive point to make, but that point just wasn't on the screen. I'm not sure I can give credit for what I know of an artist outside of the work itself. I don't need it all spelled out, but no narrative acknowledgement of a troubling thing just sort of comes off as a straightforward troubling thing. idk. Of course it looked stunning and colorful and everything, and I appreciated its absurdity and its originality. I guess it's fair to say there was a lot of creative growth between this and Love Witch. I was just really expecting/hoping to adore this one as well and was left a teeny bit miffed. (also I actually searched on here to see if there was a way to sort reviews by gender because I care about male takes on this movie even less than I do everything else in life lmao)
I honestly don't know if I prefer Love Witch or this.
"This is going to be the freshest thing since Liberace. Whaddya say?"  Viva is a satire of aspirational consumerist fantasy while at the same time glorying in its bad taste trappings. I could easily believe that Anna Biller spends a lot of time in real life engaging in her character's favorite hobby of sitting around in the bath drinking wine and reading vintage lifestyle magazines. 1972 America is a perfect setting for this theme, the height of middle class prosperity and tacky faux-opulent creature comforts, before the oil crisis hit and everything went to hell. There is a lot that is amateurish and not great about the filmmaking here (I can understand why this had so many walkouts from film critics when it premiered), but it all sort of fits. The editing is really slack and I think this would have benefited from having a half hour cut out of it. On the other hand, the plot is so shapeless that I found this an easier sit than The Love Witch, which has the same length problems but suffers from having a more predictable storyarc to wade through. Viva just drifts from vignette to vignette, giving the audience a lot of time to soak up the production details of the world it presents and catch the nuances of Biller's humor. As an actor, Biller is almost as wooden and awkward as Quentin Tarantino, but her self-conscious unease in front of the camera fits her character and theme. Almost all the acting is a weird mix of modern journeyman line deliveries undercutting an attempt at vintage camp, fitting for a story about people trying desperately to escape themselves in adopted identities. Bridget Brno's line delivery here in Viva is uncannily similar to Samantha Robinson's in The Love Witch. I wonder if there's a vintage source they're both copying, or if Brno was just the most successful actor at achieving the delivery Biller was aiming for the first time around. I was slightly repelled at the beginning but slowly warmed to Biller's idiosyncrasies. I thought it was cute that she named her character Barbi, an obvious reference to the doll but with spelling that's a specific tribute to Playboy model Barbi Benton, who Biller resembles.
¸.•*¨*✧*♡CLUB FRIENDSHIP♡*✧*¨*•.¸ In theory, I should be super into Anna Biller, her movies, and their aesthetics but I was underwhelmed by The Love Witch and I was similarly disappointed by Viva. I get that it's supposed to be very tongue-in-cheek but, after a while, the faux nostalgia becomes overwhelming and obnoxious (and I love faux nostalgia so this hurts me to say). I had a lot of clothing envy but that was about it. Such a drab watch despite all of the bright colors.
CLUB FRIENDSHIP When I first watched Anna Biller’s films The Love Witch and Viva, the feelings I felt took me back to the very beginning of my foray into cinephilia as a teen, when I first experienced the films of Quentin Tarantino. Both Tarantino and Biller are auteurs who truly care about the history of film and the endless opportunities one has to pay homage and incorporate elements of both classic and obscure works, twisting and playing with them so the result is simultaneously a throwback of sorts and something fresh, intelligent and engaging. This isn’t limited to costume design, sets, and other ephemera but also to the way things are shot, expressed, and presented. But where Biller truly stands out for me is her adamant, vocal desire to be understood and taken seriously. I follow her on Twitter and you should too - she’s incredibly active, sharing stories of all kinds and getting into somewhat futile arguments with trolls. She is a feminist, a creative, a rabble-rouser. She excites me more than most filmmakers currently in the biz today. Biller directs herself in Viva’s main role as Barbi, a neglected housewife who decides to engage in sex work. Cartoons from old issues of Playboy are a big influence on the production: lurid, corny set pieces and clothes (or lack therof) as well as one-liners so bad that they’re incredibly funny. Biller’s love of classic Hollywood is expressed through her own performance; her elocution and the way she carries herself is very Stanwyck, very Crawford. I detect Fassbinder, Buñuel, and Demy in the film as a whole; Biller wears an Anna May Wong costume during an orgy scene. I personally don’t think her influences overwhelm her story, but instead inform it. Those less in tune with film history might mistake Viva for a parody or blasé erotica, which is unfortunate.
I especially loved the Viva magazine with dreamy feminine-gaze softcore (I wish it was real, I'd absolutely subscribe to it), the 70's dinner party-style food spreads, and Biller's stalwart dedication to color palette and blocking, often matching clothing and set design to great effect (she did this for The Love Witch as well). You can see many of the traits in this film that will no doubt become her trademarks as her filmography grows (many of which are aspects of The Love Witch too): female gaze versus male gaze, ideology and patriarchy's observances of female liberation versus liberation in practice, glamour as a tool for feminism and self-love, voyeurism (she self-describes as a voyeur in the making-of feature on the DVD), burlesque culture, women's relationships with each other versus their relationships with men, the ways women are expected to take care of men, the feminine desire for emotional connection and romantic physicality versus the masculine trait of self-involvement. I will say there are multiple scenes where Barbie/Viva is raped (two times she is drugged and then raped); none of them are graphic, some of them are mostly implied rather than filmed, but all of them are upsetting and are meant to be. I couldn't stop thinking of Biller's twitter thread about how men angrily left the theater at the Rotterdam Film Festival. When women make films, we expose that which patriarchy has worked long to keep behind closed doors. Biller's dedication to classic cinema is absolute and I respect it more than love it sometimes, but I enjoyed this.
A hard one to score. Totally bonkers. Definitely felt authentically 70s, and it's super impressive how much Anna Biller put into this, creating the costumes as well as acting and directing. It was interesting to watch...the many nude scenes helped...but it did feel like an amusing spectacle quite a bit, with the deliberately wooden acting and the great cosrumes, oh and the nudity. I preferred The Love Witch, but this was a really good effort for sure.
Story : 2/3 (good) Craft: 2.5/3 (good/exceptional) Spirit: 2.5/3 (good/exceptional) Total: 7/9 (4 stars)
nothing beats anna’s attention to detail and dedication to immersion
Rewatching Biller's films on film makes me ecstatic and sad at the same time. Ecstatic for obvious reasons, sad because I realize that there are no real reasons (only fucking pragmatic ones) for the switch to digital. All films could look like this one! And especially: All filmed bodies could look like the ones in VIVA, completely exposed and yet protected by a material gaze affectionately registering their uniqueness.
insanely authentic and rich in detail, this transcends sexploitation as if it was shrugging away it's own inhibitions. the LIGHTING is DIVINE, and the colour is impeccable. work of a true auteur. also the scene in the salon with the guy eating sugar - i was CRYING with laughter, and WHY have i never seen a focus racking sex scene before that was INSPIRED. there's so much in here that is truly original to examine and yet it never, ever has so much as a hair that distracts from the 70's illusion. ART.

This film will take you on a trip into the Uncanny Valley (of the Dolls). Amazing first film for Biller. You can tell she was working out the tone and voice that she ends up mastering in Love Witch.
I'm a big fan of Anna's work. I saw The Love Witch first, so seeing this one almost makes me think of it as "practice" for the more complete work/vision of TLW. That being said, I can still appreciate what this film was trying to do, although I am not sure if she completely reached it, she got close. I think the film could have benefited from a better actress as Barbi/Viva (sorry Anna!) --she was too stilted in my opinion; it would have helped to express her message if she had been able to more convincingly portray a wider range of emotions with her acting. The costuming was fantastic; especially at the orgy.
anna biller has stated a good number of times that she has little or no interest in 70s exploitation & russ meyers, and i believe her. that doesn't mean that her movies don't play exactly like 70s exploitation & russ meyers, because they really, really do. if you played any given scene from viva with no context given, you'd probably think it's a beyond the valley of the dolls out-take. sirk is here as well, but it's run through a loopy, exploitation filter. and there is a not-subtle feminist message woven throughout, of course. the women are thoughtful, searching for fulfillment & love. the men are loathsome wanks who assume everything & everyone exists for their consumption & pleasure. personally, it plays more as caricature of reality than profound insight, but i'm not the final authority on such matters. regardless of how you interpret them, i think both of her films are delights & demented hoots. anyone who liked the love witch will find plenty to enjoy here as well, & ought to seek it out.
Anne Biller's type of guy is so narrow that I thought the male lead in this and the Love Witch were the same man. But they are, in fact, different actors.
The 👏 sexual 👏 revolution 👏 happened 👏 on 👏 men’s 👏 terms 👏
you know a film has its heart at the right place when one character hands another one an antique wooden duck as a souvenir.
Anna Biller: ambitious, genius, cinematic spirit, biting commentator, preeminent cinematic feminist, Russ Meyer and Douglas Sirk's better combined successor. (Also seeing this made me realise how far off I was about The Love Witch being a riff on sexploitation. There's aspects of it in there, but it is definitively doing a significantly different thing. Viva is pulling much more from that vein, and seeing her thematic concerns shift into new stylistic and narrative territory over time is seeing a true artist being so supremely confident in herself that it's breathtaking.)
And I thought the amount of costume changes in barbarella was impressive.
when the one girl said "isn't it weird how we have to get used to existing in our most natural state"...........i felt that
Anna Biller is a true visionary. Only she could reverse sexploitation like that and make it a such a poignant social satire.
Babies can't have cigarettes and alcohol. Babies can only have milk. I know Anna Biller is actually a competent artist at the top of her game but y'all can have your "how's your sex life?" Room spoon-throwing parties and I'll just be drinking up this milk instead, irony-free. Viva is those silly Playboy cartoons come to life with a dash of that Todd Haynes' attuned awareness that "the good ole days" and "Men's Lifestyle" magazines are crocks of shit that creates entitled shits. (Also this movie answers the how's your sex life question. "We have a great sex life, honey.") The languid pace, stilted acting, cartoon strip dialogue and immense set design is *pure*art*. Hey, everyone! I'm gonna sing a song, it's about love!
Watching an Anna Biller movie, one that she stars in no less, knowing that she is a hapa is absolutely crushing. This context intensifies everything about her work imo.
"There has never been a better time to be a man. The willing women, the dandy clothes, the frills, the big rings and jewelry, the open shirts, the sense of entitlement. Take it from me: savour this time. For it will soon be gone, never to return." The female male gaze. What a serious, major work this is. This is self-representing, self-sexualising and bruisingly honest cinema, responding and reclaiming a genre, time and style that would have been absolutely against Biller's rights and interests as a filmmaker and a human being. Biller's passion and versatility bleeds through every single perfectly-realised frame of this cinematic indulgence, and, although this is apparently a parody and often hilarious, there is a distinct vein of sadness inflecting every interaction Barbie has with a man. It was horrible then, it was bad in 2007, and it's still awful now, and Biller's beautiful, stylised vision makes the timeless narrative even more timeless as a work of visual art. My, this is stunning. I just love it when a film balances humour and pathos perfectly and wraps it up in absolute visual splendour. Just watch it, goddammit.
I'm perhaps not in the best place to judge 'Viva' as I am completely unfamiliar with the (s)exploitation films that it attempts to emulate and satirize all at once. However even to the uninitiated 'Viva' has a unique and enjoyable sense of style which feels very distinctive. From the luscious set design to the stilted dialogue and performances 'Viva' fully commits to emulating it's inspirations. Despite this the film feels very bloated at slightly over two hours. By the third musical interlude I was happy to see the back of the film. The film did not do enough to justify its large amount of sexual violence. For a film that is so light in tone having multiple rape scenes (and at least two more rape attempts) seems completely unnecessary. Surely there are better ways of critiquing playboy culture without such scenes which go nearly completely unaddressed during the rest of the film (in fact the film ends on the 'happy' note of the lead character accepting a role in a musical directed by her rapist). These misguided scenes hang over the film and detract from any of its successful aspects.
I totally freaked out in front of a friend (as well as some strangers) when I found an unopened, out of print DVD of this film in a record store. My reaction, as I would have anticipated, was totally justified, because Viva is sublime. Anna Biller and her work excites me like none other.
Critic Consensus: Though it's lengthy and doesn't always walk the line between schlock and kitschy homage successfully, Viva's lovely visuals and knowing humor are undeniable.
The problem with Ms Anna Biller is that she packs too much quality intellectually, visually, and emotionally to be really decoded successfully by a mass audience that can process any two of those things in sketch doses at any one time, but has no idea what to do with 2 hours of it with no laugh track. For example, any 20 random frames from this movie would make a hit exhibit in any photography gallery. The production and lighting are so impeccably clever and detailed as stills they would be considered gorgeous (even when they include dubious looking male characters, which are btw masterpieces of casting). The problem is since she makes every scene look _that_ polished, I suspect many people just forget the work that went into it and start taking it for granted reducing it to just "that sexploitation 70s look." The feminism is also too clever and nuanced for simple consumption. It's nothing like your average museum exhibit on feminism so scared of saying the wrong thing it cannot articulate anything past "you can also be a CEO" platitudes. Miss Biller is not trapped in the safety of the first wave. Yes, every guy in the film is a moron but theres much more to it than that. There is a complex game of female gaze here, one taking place always through a mirror. In short, Ms Biller has made here a cult object of beauty and depth to be digested slowly.
#52FilmsByWomen 2017 pt. 40. As in The Love Witch, Biller's production design is absolutely stunning. If I hadn't known the film was from 2007, I could easily have believed it was a skin flick from 1972. This is not an easy thing to pull off. But unlike other "retrosploitation" outings (Astron-6, I'm looking in your direction), this has form-function cohesion and an intention behind the styling. Much of the film is a conversation between 2nd and 3rd-wave feminism as the future gazes at the past gazing at the future. Cf. The Lobster
I really like Anna Biller, her commitment to her vision is amazing, her perspective is unique, and her vision is gorgeous. Anna is the force behind Viva and, most recently, The Love Witch. I say force as she serves as writer, director, producer, art director, set decorator, costumer, animator, and she did the music. Oh, and in Viva, she was the star. If something cant' be found, she will make it. I commend her for her efforts and hope she continues in the future, truly she is amazing. The theme that runs through her work is the depiction of women in film in different periods. For The Love Witch, it was the 1960s; in Viva we are firmly in the early 1970s, the era of free love, swinging and women's lib. The tone of Viva is fun but there is social commentary as Anna plays Barbi, the bored housewife whose husband brings home the money but works late, takes numerous business trips which he likes to extend for vacation time, and likes his lovely wife to remain firmly secured at home. Barbi grows weary of this less than equitable situation and an ensuing argument see hubby Mark storm out. Serendipitously Barbi's best friend Sheila also splits from her husband finding both ladies unattached and ready to embrace the free love ethos of the time. That is when Barbi becomes Viva, someone ready to live and determine her own course. However, with each encounter disproving the glories of free sex and parties, Viva becomes increasing disenchanted with empty liaisons, she needs something more. For Anna, this seems to summarize her views on society. The overt sexism of era was exhibited during her brief employment wherein her boss saw her career path based on routine gropings, and the oppressive and soulless home life her husband idealized. As a counterpoint, the swinging random sexual hook ups were no better. This dissection of mores was never heavy handed and often was presented in a fun way. She never lectured but her point got across. The satire is strong with this one. A strong point with Anna's work is her creative direction. The set decoration was always on point, the clothes, the make up, everything seethed kitsch and it was gorgeous. Again, her vision is exemplary and her commitment to it, astounding. She knows what she wants to present and does not flinch. There was a good deal of nudity, both male and female, and Anna did her share of it. She is her art. The acting and dialogue were both a bit overwrought and, especially with the former, exaggerated, often deliberately so. That can work with sketch comedy but in a feature, it can become tiresome. Hence, the film dragged. It clocks in at just over two hours, it should have been 90 minutes. The film was a lot of fun and looked spectacular but was in need of some editing. Anna reminds me a bit of Rob Zombie, both have uncompromising visions and some glorious set pieces, but these set pieces don't always fit together into a whole; sometimes they work better individually or as still images. With so much going for it and with huge respect to Anna Biller, I wanted to like this film more than I did. I am giving an extra half star because it looks so good. See Viva, but perhaps watch it in chunks.
Anna Biller's naughty, independently produced debut looks and sounds exactly like the early 70s sexploitation flick which she skillfully mocks, satirizes and pays a loving homage to, all at once. Starring herself as Barbi without 'e' - a bored housewife that presumes the identity of the titular libertine - Viva is amusing and refreshing in equal measures. After her husband Rick (Chad England) goes on a month-long business trip, Biller's "Belle de Jour" starts discovering the joys and ploys of the sexual revolution - prostitution, drug abuse, nudist colonies, horny hippies, bisexuality, orgies and the most pretentious of artists. The quirky characters she comes in contact with frequently act as if they wandered off the set for a commercial or erotic magazine shoot, adding to the silly comic effect. But, even though all of them are extremely caricatured, one can easily recognize real people, as well as biting social commentary behind their flamboyant appearance. As in the last year's campy thriller The Love Witch, Biller is the multi-hyphenate in charge of directing, writing, editing, designing sets and costumes, even animating a short psychedelic sequence - all with an assured hand. Drenching everything from walls, through mini dresses and all the way to velvet cushions in saturated colors and trip-inducing patterns, she creates an uninterrupted string of visually stunning shots which make for an unforgettable cinematic experience. Also praiseworthy are the cast's deliberately stilted, softcore-porn-level performances which add a lot to Viva's overwhelming kitschy charm.
A picture perfect homage to 70s sexploitation films with a sharp eye for art direction. The booze budget alone must have been epic.
Amazingly, Anna Biller claims that her films aren't meant to be satires but serious social commentaries, which means she could very well be the Ed Wood of Feminist Cinema. However, there's too much artifice in her work to not be intentional. Nevertheless, her first feature length--an homage to '70s sexploitation films--is near genius regardless of who she may or may not be trolling.
"That's Mae West you ASs!" Anna Biller doing what she does best with a female centered film having fun and sex in a rompy color-filled modern day exploitation film. She's a real auteur of her craft. Hell she starred, directed, edited, did the art production and costumes?? Holy shit that's so much to do for one film and she balances it all out so well. My only complaint might have been that this could have been cut about thirty minutes maybe? Overall, I just love the exploits of Viva exploring the sexual revolution of the seventies.
Overlong, but still amazing. I want to marry this smart, sharp woman!
I didn't love this as much as The Love Witch, but it's still mostly charming and enjoyable. Anna Biller's attention to detail is impeccable and I admire her subversive take on sexism in the "free love" era. The stilted dialogue can be a bit much (especially for a 2-hour film), but the vivid set design and costumes are fantastic and it's clearly a love letter to '60s/'70s sexploitation.
Anna Biller takes a stab at sexploitation and it's a lot of fun. I get why it takes her so long to make her movies - her attention to detail, from sets, costumes, film effects, delivery, etc, is impeccable, painstakingly deliberate, and unmatched by none save the highest caliber of directors, maybe. I really hope it doesn't take her another 9 years to make her next one, but even if it does, I'll still be anxiously awaiting it.
Anna Biller is freaking awesome. Watched "The Love Witch" last year and I still believe that's her best, but Viva is not far behind.
It has some great moments and an incredible attention to production detail but sadly mimics the pacing of the genre's worst examples. It straddles the line between homage and parody so consistently, I know a statement is being made but I'm not entirely certain what it is most of the time. With better editing and some stronger subversive elements, this could've been great.
Despite her multitude of creative credits writer/director/actor/songwriter/art director Anna Biller doesn't specialize in writing or direction or acting in as much as she does in a campy midcentury vernacular. Note how every song (I think there are four) is overdubbed without any pretense of authenticity, but that something so seemingly incidental as drapes has been meticulously thought out. (Really, every indoor scene depicts a room or two with really impressive drapes in it.) She seems to be finding her footing as a storyteller, or at least I'm not certain of what to make of the film’s narrative about a woman’s sexual awakening circa 1970. On one hand, Biller’s indictment of male entitlement and insecurity is sharp-witted and often hilarious, but on the other her heroine’s transition from housewife to prostitute is tentative, as though Biller isn’t certain of what she’s meant to iconify to a contemporary audience. (It is clear, however, that she’s seen Beyond the Valley of the Dolls at least two dozen times.) But her films are so weird and assured in their parody of gender roles that to critique their ham-handed narratives is certainly to miss the point. This is also a reminder that her latest film, The Love Witch, is totally amazing.
While the dialogue is stylized in a way that's a little tricky to get into at first, to an even higher extent than The Love Witch, once I got onto its wavelength, I had an amazing time with it. It's both tremendously fun, supremely sexy, and has a strong feminist message regarding how male desire is often made at the expense of female desire or wishes.
Anna Biller creates an amazing 70's aesthetic from which she breaks down tropes and gender norms/performances found in 70's exploitation films. Unlike films such as Dazed and Confused, which looks to create a period aesthetic for the purpose of nostalgia. Biller seems to be doing so for the purpose of critical analysis. This is not to say that she is not having fun, nor is it to imply that this is not a fun film. This film is great. The thing that I can really get behind is Biller's attention to detail. Each frame is bursting with detail from background to foreground. The art direction is superb. Read some other (better written) reviews and check this film out for yourself.
Boogie Nights and Valley of the Dolls and RAW COMEDY. This is amazing. Riddled with bant in every frame. I had such a good time the whole way through.

anna biller is a goddamn national treasure
Two suburban couples experiment with sex, drugs and bohemia in early 1970's Los Angeles. You could basically copy and paste my review from the The Love Witch onto this. I actually preferred Viva even though it has the same flaw of being 30 minutes to long. I'm glad there's someone who making this sort of cinema and will be interested in what Anna Billar does next.
A feature film full of porn acting. Nice! The film does not warrant it's ridiculous running time but it's still very funny and it's something different. I decided to check this out after really enjoying The Love Witch and I'm glad that I did.
If Anna Biller can just keep making throwback movies, I would be satisfied. This one feels like a movie made by Russ Meyer but from a female perspective. It does have the boobs, full nudity, sex and flashy 70s fashion that you would see in a sexploitation film. This one for a first feature, I enjoyed for just being a fun and sexy film. It's not perfect due to its running time but fans of classic b-movie cinema should really check this out.
52 Films By Women Challenge (2017): Film #7 It took me a while to 'get' this film. The on purpose bad acting, the cheapness all distracted me and served as a barrier to my enjoyment at first. It was only towards the end that I realised the style served more than as a parody of bad 60s/70s brady bunch style acting; it acts as a commentary on the performative nature of patriarchal gender roles, the constant product placement asides serve to highlight the way capitalism commodifies gender - further strengthening the patriarchy. Even the alienating nature of the film reflects how society alienates us from ourselves. I particularly liked how the 'sexual revolution' was critiqued, the film pointed out how it lead to whole new difficulties for women at the time. Even now as a young woman I have first hand experience of the limits of 'sex positive' feminism. This isn't talked about very often and it was explored well here. Viva wasn't always the most enjoyable or easiest film to watch but it was certainly fascinating and gave me a lot to think about.
What a fun watch. It had a great production value and very authentic to the era.
what the hell is anna biller on
Super-impressive Sexploitation pastiche/parody that hits every visual and tonal nail on the head. Satirically nightmarish at times, nightmarishly drawn out at others. Interesting interview with director Anna Biller on the audience response to the movie here: annabillersblog.blogspot.co.uk/2006/10/thoughts-on-viva-premiere.html "Audiences are masochists and they're brutal, nothing is too strong for them. I see that now."
52 films by women 2017: 16/52. If you're looking for a way to get your anticipation for Anna Biller's The Love Witch down to a realistic level, why not watch her previous feature? A long, long, long two hours, Viva dedicates itself so wholeheartedly to pastiching a long-dead subgenre that it acts as a kind of prophylactic for its wider points. What I mean here is this; there are, obviously, connections between misogyny today and misogyny in the 1970s. But rather than point them up, Viva keeps underscoring what's different, to the point where all you can appreciate is the surfaces; the loud suits and wide lapels, the incessant easy-listening music, the Polaroid cameras. It's well-observed, certainly, but what is the point of obsessing this much about the minutia? Twenty years ago, this vision of masculinity was so dated that Mike Myers could build a profitable comedy franchise out of mocking it, but Biller seems to treat it like a fresh, relevant target. Biller is certainly an attentive parodist, capable of finding exactly the right sounds, fabrics and lenses to create that 1970s ambience. But in narrative and directorial terms that attention curdles into pedantry. It's never funny, thanks largely to Biller's determination to repeat every funny-bad acting tic until even people watching a film in the theatre next door get it. It's also funereally paced, frequently taking five shots to get across points the exploitation films it's parodying would have to make in two, and it repeats an image of Biller smoking in the bath for little observable reason. (It's worth mentioning that the nudity, like the gay stereotypes, are only implicitly parodied; you assume Biller has a critical perspective on the exploitative elements of the films she's drawing from, but you have to take it on trust because they're so faithfully reproduced) Biller, clearly, loves revelling in this stuff, and her sheer level of multihyphenate control over every aspect of the film is to be applauded. If there's one job she should surrender to someone else, though, it's the editing, if only to get it down to a bearable run-time. I lasted one repetitive, obvious hour before it decided to become a bad musical as well, then I bailed.
Anna Biller is a true auteur. In Viva she is credited with a staggering 10 crew roles, as well as playing lead actress. The attention to detail is staggering, especially considering the comparatively tiny budget. There have been plenty modern of films that have attempted to mimic 70's cinema but none have come as close as this. With that being said Viva is seen through a more modern lens, and pokes fun at the lack of female power in the films it is inspired by.
Anna Biller manages to create a work which is both a biting satire of and a keen indulger of a bygone genre, as a way to skewer outdated social roles through the prism of entitlement and the simmering weaponisation of white picket utopianism.
I basically had the same reaction to this as I did watching Anna Biller's THE LOVE WITCH. The film has the same strengths (fab production design, delicious skewering of the sexual politics of the patriarchy and the notion of the 60s and 70s as a time of liberation) and the same weaknesses (it stretches the material at two hours).
#directedbywomen #52filmsbywomen - film 44
Biller's aesthetics screams excess: it is supercolorful, tacky and overacted. But you can't get enough of its personality and ambience! You kind of live it too, especially thanks to Anna's performance. She really enlivens the film's spirit - even if awkwardly and shyly.
Anna Biller is an exciting talent. Among the many sensual delights to be found in Viva are beautiful sets, perfect musical choices, and fun period detail. But I'm trying to come to terms with the insistence on using camp imagery and technique (as far as the acting and script are concerned) to espouse a particular worldview (which I happen to agree with). The mixture of self-aware schlock and progressive politics is appealing for numerous reasons, but it makes the content feel less urgent and the film as a whole feel tedious at times. I think something interesting could come of this formula, but it doesn't quite work for me here.
This is a MASTERPIECE
This is a little bit more muddled than the love witch for me, but still extremely clever. Such a great and interesting look at what is ingrained in society and what the true consequences of that are. It shows things in such a non-obvious and non condescending way that it is incredibly effective and what could be such a preachy message is laid clear and obvious and oh so interesting.
Viva is obviously a passion project and while hearing the borrowed music from Camille 2000 got me all excited, the movie is overly long and becomes a bit of a bore as the plot becomes somewhat repetitive as Viva is discovering her sexual identity by moving from one partner to the next. Also, the movie would have benefitted from having a real actress in the leading role. Anna Biller is obviously nervous in several scenes and keeps blinking her eyes uncontrollably, which was distracting. There's good stuff here as well (like the overall tone and attention to detail), but I have a feeling Anna Billers followup movie will be much better.
Starring director Anna Biller as Barbie, a bored housewife who yearns for sexual adventure, she adopts the persona of Viva and embarks on a journey through prostitution, lesbianism and self discovery. It's overlong and in need of some pruning throughout, but it's funny, rich in satire and the slavish attention to detail to recreate the 70s era of filmmaking is astounding.
YES @ anna biller, this was such a good movie i mean it'd be completely flawless if it was 30min shorter but omg i'm living for this!!!!!
Artificial sets, intentionally bad acting and full-frontal nudity abound in Anna Biller's silly tribute to the harmless American sexploitation movies of the late 60s and early 70s. And I was totally onboard with it at first, the opening scenes of suburban couple Sheila & Mark and their neighbour Barbi being an absolute joy to watch (in particular, Jared Sanford, who plays Mark, seems utterly authentic). It's an exaggerated take on sitcom characters, as they spend their Sunday sitting around the outdoor pool getting smashed on scotch from morning til night. The next day, Barbi even gets comically chased around an office desk by her lecherous boss (who then fires her for not putting out). And so, bored, Barbi & Sheila decide take advantage of women's lib and become call girls. But the joke wears thin very, very quickly - after about the length of a sitcom, in fact: 25 minutes or so. And for some reason this movie runs for over two fucking hours. When the comedy turns to drama, it's impossible to care about these characters, because they're just cartoons really. Such a shame that something that starts so well ends up as such a drag.
Extraordinary film. Not sure why anybody would purposely make the worst film of all time, but that's what has happened here. I think it was making some social point but I couldn't get far enough past the ham acting to care.
Gorgeous homage to '60s/'70s sexploitation but, much like Anna Biller's The Love Witch, it runs a little too long and runs out of steam about 20 minutes before the end.
*Takes fake sip of whisky and laughs unconvincingly*
Although not as accomplished or enjoyable as The Love Witch, Viva is a fine feature debut from Anna Biller (who had previously been learning her craft in a number of short films). It's fun, vibrant, and effectively nails the tone of this kind of film, while at the same time skewering it and making some incisive points.
I’m still trying to process this one, I’m not sure if I liked it or not, but one thing’s for sure is that I have been left intrigued by the director, Anna Biller, and left wanting to check out more of her work. This film blurs the line between pastiche and schlocky sexploitation films quite well and brings up a lot of interesting subtext that I have probably barely scratched the surface of, the film is so long and quite full on that I do wonder if it maybe stumbled around that line just a little too much. Added to #52FilmsByWomen: letterboxd.com/superalexman/list/52filmsbywomen-2017/
First off: I made a total bumblef**k of an error reviewing The Love Witch where I assumed, since she did just about everything else on that movie (as here - she even does some animation in this one), Anna Biller had played the title role. As soon as I saw her in this I was like, "ok that is not the same person…" so, sorry about that, I just wanted to mention it here for anyone who read that review. Her performance (and everyone else's) here is just as deliberately mannered and styled on the period the whole thing is emulating as I thought it was there, though, and just as much fun, though as with The Love Witch I'm not sure if it's 2 hours worth of fun: I'm not sure if its substance really justifies either the running time or the obvious effort that went into producing it (when you think of how quickly the actual movies it's aping were probably made). I see people talking about the importance of the female gaze with these movies - and yes, we need more women making movies, absolutely - but (and maybe it's just my usual completely messed up personal sense of gender - to me it's all valid at the same time none of it is) I just don't know if you tested it blind with an audience that they'd think it was particularly different from anyone else (meaning, men) trying to recreate the styles of John Waters, Frank Perry, Herschell Gordon Lewis, Russ Meyer? (I'm not too familiar with Meyer's stuff but it feels like he belongs in this list?) etc (I'd even go so far back as Vincente Minnelli who to me kind of had a "female" eye). I'm just not sure if that aspect is as significant as some want it to be - like, the thing is to me, that I think I was trying to say in my Love Witch review too, is that the thing about artists (real artists, I'm not talking the macho likes of Michael Bay here, for instance) in general is they don't look at things the way everyone else does - certainly Biller doesn't and that's why her work is so visually compelling - so I'm not sure we can really gender their gaze the same way? Maybe I'm missing something. Probably I'm missing something. And I'm not making myself nearly as clear as I wish I could (my head's a mess so far this year, to be honest). But it sure is fun and pleasing to the eye (if not quite as beautiful, accomplished, and watchable as The Love Witch - this one kind of captures the 70s tone too much?). Some of the music's gorgeous too (even if I was smart enough to realise it wasn't all original this time… the songs, again, are awful, however… but I think most of them were meant to be…)
Just the right side of knowing parody. This perfectly captures the hair, makeup, costume, and general vibe of Sixties and early Seventies sex comedies. I was hoping for a deeper feminist message. The Love Witch will hopefully build on this.
Biller's sexploitation answer to Scott Sanders' Black Dynamite, this Russ Meyer-esque satire takes a bold stance in the face of the male-centered world of moviemaking. Biller has stolen the male gaze and turned it on herself and her costars, in what can only be described as both illuminating and extraordinarily brave. Showing hypermasculinity and misogyny for the farce that they have become, and always were, the director fights patriarchal disparity with a sense of humor that nonetheless embraces the undeniable aesthetic beauty of bright colors and comically-overdone sets.
Having really enjoyed the Love Witch by Anna Biller, I had to watch some of her previous work. This is a tale of suburban experimentation in the 1970's, it's in an exploitation style but with the key difference being that it's from a female point of view. This different viewpoint is eye opening, as it leads to many hilarious scenes where the male characters are reduced to two dimensional bimbos. Groping, sleazy, manipulative, all the men in this will do anything they can to get a bit of lady action. Social commentary like this is very powerful, possibly too close to reality for some people. In addition, there is a LOT of nudity in this.
"There are some thematic aspects of Viva I wish Biller had pushed a little further (and a few scenes I wish were shaved down to expedite the pace), but there’s an endlessly enjoyable aesthetic in her staging of the film’s lingerie lounging, Scotch swilling, porn-browsing swinger-era softcore smut I can’t help but take delight in. Just the way characters punctuate each of their own lame jokes with unwarranted, maniacal laughter feels both so true to the era & so clearly aligned with what Biller wants to accomplish in her modernization. It’s incredible she was able to figure out her own concrete sense of style as soon as her first feature." Read the full review here.
Viva tells the story of Barbara (Anna Biller, who also writes and Directs) a bored housewife in 1972 who gets sucked into the sexual revolution. Abandoned by her husband, Barbi is dragged into trouble by her girlfriend, who spouts women's lib as she gets Barbi to discard her bra and go out on the town. Barbi becomes a Red Riding Hood in a sea of wolves, and quickly learns a lot more than she wanted to about nudist camps, the hippie scene, orgies, bisexuality, sadism, drugs, and bohemia. This is both and very good and very bad film at the same time, the good first, the direction, and attention to detail, music, colours and overall feel of the film is incredible. This doesn't feel like a homage film, but it's like a lost film from the late 60's or early 70's, the filmmaking is that good. The downside is I just did not get on with the story, and acting style of the piece, but that be because I feel that I don't know enough about sex cinema from the 60's and 70's. That said Anna Biller seems like a real talent and I can't wait to see The Love Witch, her follow up, which is out later this year.
"HAHAHA"-everyone at anytime
Milwaukee's UWM Union Theater where Biller introduced. I guess she's talented but she's also self-involved, self-aware and self-satisfied to degrees that kind of categorically turn me off. Seeing her attitudes play out in art has me leaving the room after about 30 seconds.
Viva does an excellent job at immersing you in what feels like a perfectly calculated parody of 70s sexploitation. The sets, costumes, and filming style do such a good job at emulating that "look" you almost forget you are actually watching something from our modern era. With that also comes the pitfalls of the genre itself, it's a bit dull. However, that appears to be absolutely intentional as the film is going for near perfect replication of a 70s sexploitation film. Viva is largely a feminist film. The concept of sexual liberation for women is its main theme. The film also includes a few musical numbers that stop the flow of the film and probably are my major concern with it. It would have been just as good, or even better, had the musical numbers been cut.
A little long maybe, but a great indication of what Anna Biller is about. Immaculate era recreation, what at first appears to be simple homage quickly reveals a more cutting underbelly. The camp and kitsch trappings are colourful props for an indictment of chauvinism. Witty, clever, cine-literate... I'm looking forward to THE LOVE WITCH.
anna biller's set design is marvellous. it's a little too long and gets a bit wearisome, but it's a really interesting parody of 70s sexploitation films and it's charming in its own stilted-and-campy way.
I find that Anna Biller is really good at the whole throwback to Russ Meyer kitsch and late '60/early '70s Eurosleaze like Radley Metzger et al. without calling attention to itself and being genuinely fun and amusing. But like The Love Witch, it's also shallow and instantly forgettable.
An amazing, hilarious, complicated, multi-layered film that does some real work and isn't as silly as it might seem at first glance. It inherently rejects the notion that its own aesthetic is (merely) artificial, never blinking at the sheen and gloss it's bathed in and actually letting it function *as* aesthetics in itself. (This is to say, it's not set design and mise-en-scène functioning toward just narrative significance. The settings and objects in the film are art in themselves.) It's seriously biting in the critique it levels against the gender politics of the era but seriously in love with the interior design of that time. It's interested in uncovering oft-told stories but from a new perspective, one that doesn't de-eroticize the sexual revolution but sort of re-eroticizes it, from a more womanly angle. The lighting is bright and quite frontal, usually creating a lovely effect pairing well with its use of celluloid. (Looks as if it didn't have any digital touchup work.) But basically, it's a whole lotta curveballs. Thought I'd have a clearer overall sense of what it's doing after the second viewing, but I think I have less of one.
Too long and a slave to '70s stylings to a stilted fault, but I loved the jabs at different counter-cultural men. The drug haze hippie who uses free love as an excuse to bed any and all women. The artist who elevates his date to muse status and encourages her to model while he stokes his own ego. Too bad self-indulgent musical numbers and bland hello-goodbye conversations distract from Viva's scathing social satire. As a kind-of-man-hater (including myself which makes it hard to function at times) I longed for Biller to take down more whimpering simps and testosterone slathered dunces that project themselves as types in hip scenes both then and now. The more things change, the more they stay the same. Especially in Austin, I can spot a self-styled rock'n'roll jabronie, french fry greasy hair net artist, city witch, "painter," dog collar noise musician, cryptic stone-faced poet, or casually catty zinester loping on the horizon. But Viva's lurid, fetishistic set designs that perfectly match the ON POINT me-generation outfits kept my eyeballs glued to the screen! If the content hit as hard as that LOOK, I'd be all-in!
OK, so this goes on way too long especially given that late-60s/early-70s sleaze isn't precisely *my thing*, but the talent on display here is tangible. I'm really looking forward to checking out Anna Bullet's new one, The Love Witch.
"I want to be called Viva, which in Italy means "to live." Because that's what I want to do now - to live!" "I've always wanted to be a prostitute. It sounds so romantic!!!" Ahh Jeez! where the fuck has this film been all my life!!!!!!!!!?????????
fantastic and hilarious. retro done right. funnier and better-paced than The Love Witch.
Made on what's clearly a much smaller budget than that of the The Love Witch, Viva has all the same charm and insight. Two months ago I hadn't even heard of Anna Biller, and now she's one of my favorite filmmakers. Her attention to detail is remarkable and the precision of her directing makes what could've been an absolutely bizarre movie something very compelling (though it is still very strange). This was such a harsh look at the sexual revolution and how it was marketed to women, as well as the gendered differences in the ways men and women experience sex. And yet it's still so funny? What a movie, honestly. Rating: 77/100
I really dislike camp, and I think this movie has helped me understand why: the dissonance between appreciative homage and parody. I guess most people can interpret parody in a respectful way, but to me it's almost always taking the piss, so I don't see how a movie can be both at the same time.
Wow, man. This is about a woman named Barbie, a woman living in Los Angeles 1972 with her husband Rick. She's best friends with a couple next door, Sheila and Mark, but she's kind of bored and mildly repulsed by the monotony and sexist nature of a housewife life. So she participates in the cultural sexual and spiritual revolution at the time and discovers herself.  I saw this after seeing the trailer to The Love Witch, a film that looked awesome, for preparation. While it is long for the "schtick" it's doing, there are still a lot of things to love about this.  First off, the attention to detail to recreating this era is absolutely outstanding. The set designs are perfectly gaudy and lavishly arranged, with special attention to the furniture and props. The costume design is immaculate, attention grabbing and eye popping but authentic to the time. The colors in this are masterfully used. The particular camera filter (?) used feels very specific to the time and old school, lending to a vintage, lost relic vibe. The music is perfect, wonderfully cheesy in all the right ways. This could easily come off as a jokey 'Tim and Eric' skit but the attention to detail is too great to lump this in with them, it's so wonderful. Anna Biller is clearly a true fan of films from this era and that's lovingly captured on screen. I think the story, while could definitely be cut in places, is engaging. The way that society treated women in places like home, work and even just out in public was jarring and shocking at times. I liked how it used Barbie as a viewpoint into the many different sections of this era, almost like a more specific Forest Gump. I was appalled at the way random men would just catcall at the women and they didn't even respond, perhaps so desensitized to this behavior that it unfazed them. This film even takes aim at the "liberal" awakening, like how it used those open women in a vulnerable situation to take advantage of. Biller really nails every facet of this generation. I think the dialogue/acting could be a deciding factor for a lot of people. It's purposefully stilted and awkward, just like that era's films were. Someone will say something super cheesy and then laugh obnoxiously at it for 5 seconds, look for Mark's character to do this a lot. While I think it's over the top at a few points, Biller slips in some sly commentary at times that make it worthwhile. And the corny acting worked to really sell the authenticity.  I don't know if this fully garners its two hour (!) runtime, I think it runs out of things to say at times outside of recreating this era. But there is some smart analysis into this time that ultimately makes it worthwhile. And I can't praise the set and costume designs enough, truly a visual feast. I don't think I've seen a modern film more embody the aesthetic of Lana Del Rey's music than this one. REALLY looking forward to 'The Love Witch' after this.
"The time 1972, the place Los Angeles": ooh, chic. Really thick, almost suffocating parody -- if you couldn't tell already, so thick -- meant to eviscerate stodgy, old-fashioned, pee-warm gender roles in softcore sexploitation. I guess it might be hilarious if you're in the perfect mood, but no matter what mood you're in it's not very funny.
"Money can't buy you love, but it can buy you a bunch of sex slaves"
Anna Biller's The Love Witch was mostly a success. Viva is not. Overlong by about 40 minutes, it's dull, unfocused and desperate, so very desperate to be culty and outrageous. This film got so tedious I ended up actually angry at it. The production design might be amazing, but the actors waste their great styling by self-consciously gurning at the camera constantly: LOLOLOL geddit, GEDDIT? Ugh.
Entertaining but slight. It's an attempt to make a homage to exploitation films from the 60s and 70s and the art direction and costumes look perfect. Part ironic, part sincere and wholly created by someone who wasn't there. A housewife and her neighbor best friend get curious, get jobs and lose their husbands temporarily while experimenting with their sexuality and drugs.
Some really funny moments. Amazing costume and color work. Pretty decent musical numbers. Sometimes it feels a little too forced for good camp.
Despite the rating, this does make me more excited for "The Love Witch." The parts that work here really work.
Russ Meyer/John Waters/Todd Haynes-esque satire of 60/70s sexploitation cinema by Anna Biller. Set design/costume work is phenomenal. Loved it. Biller knows how to do a genre homage right.
Viva (2007) 8/10 Inventive in ways that I've yet to comprehend, it's one of those films that you can't explain how they happened, what inspired them and how you didn't hear about them before. I'm not an expert on all the genres that it riffs nor all the films that it references, but I can get the feeling that is mocking and at the same time uses to put forward a new perspective of culture, while denouncing what came before. It's also really funny, and the songs are really well performed inside the cheesy style in which they exist, in which, honestly, the whole movie exists.
For being less than a decade old, it may have been just enough ahead of its time not to receive its deserved acclaim. It's Down With Love, but glossier, and with far more bite than (mere) homage. As such, it's rollicking and hilarious, utterly saturated in a celluloid, 1970-era color palette with hues that almost literally scream out at you, drunk on their own pleasure. Having seen only the trailer for the similarly beautiful The Love Witch, needed to see Biller's previous feature before getting access to her latest. Viva keeps a straight face, somehow, even as its characters emit wonderfully/painfully forced laughter. But not only during its obvious tongue-in-cheek moments—the satire persists even during a rape scene. I'm definitely not (qualified to be) the person to say how this scene works or is okay or whatever, so I'll just note that it's there. And that it produced discomfort that was undoubtedly part of the goal to dislodge a viewer from standard viewing practices (L. Mulvey) when watching a body-genre film (L. Williams) like this one. That is to say, the rape is not oriented toward audience pleasure. In fact, traditional elements (like bodies) in general are not aimed at audience pleasure. Instead, Biller lets the sheer ridiculousness of genre codes and this era's absurd values and practices provide their own face-palmy pleasures. But as much as the film seems to look back at "those days," it also knows these ways of thinking are embedded enough in the popular psyche that the film will inevitably mess with many viewers. But anyway, this strikes me as a pretty radical, subversive throwback whose intense meta-campiness goes full-on Brecht in distantiating its audience through overblown artifice and "false" performances that break the flow of genre expectations and rhythms.
I watched Anna Biller's Viva in preparation for her new movie, The Love Witch. Viva is a send-up of 70's sexploitation of the type directed by Radley Metzger - Biller even includes direct references to Metzger's Camille 2000. The design, most of which Biller handled herself, is impeccable, and she uses it to pitch-perfectly dress her story of female empowerment and self-actualization. Viva is an entertaining statement that perhaps does not work as well as Biller intended.
Very good homage to sexual awakening movies of the early 1970s, with the bonus of ultimately actually empowering the women instead of destroying them. Lush colors and fun sets add to the fun, along with the flute-heavy soundtrack.
I don’t think I’ve ever seen another film that’s replicated the sheer ugliness of Chesty Morgan-era 70s sexploitation as well as VIVA. The points of reference are pretty clear - it’s essentially a who’s who of the Something Weird Video catalog - but, I think that focusing on the fact that, say, one sequence looks like something from a Metzger film is the wrong approach to take. It’s obvious that Anna Biller has a real understanding of the underlying sexism of even the most ‘pro-woman’ of sexploitation films (and, really, the sexual revolution as a whole) and is using the trappings of the genre - nudist camps, eccentric artists, orgies, suburban melodrama, etc - to subvert and comment on it. The film runs a little long, but that's not much of a criticism. It's a tour- de-force in every respect and a pretty astonishing and fearless debut feature. Loved it.
Worth the watch. A bit long.
"I've always wanted to be a prostitute. It sounds so romantic!!!" Same
With its leisurely pace, it's impossible to miss how much work went into this film. To match the specific look Anna Biller and her collaborators were going for, all these period props and costumes had to be found or made. The same goes for the sets and locations. It's gorgeous to look at and filled with bare flesh, but with the presentational acting and blatant sloganeering, it's much closer to Jean-Luc Godard than Russ Meyer. Biller wants us to take something away from this film. Like Guy Maddin she's using the form of vintage media to deconstruct the artificiality of both the past and the present. You become hyper-aware of the sexism and hypocrisy that was just underneath the surface of the "free love" movement. With a Trump presidency looming, a film like Viva serves as an uneasy reminder of the "good times" red hats want to get back to.
Better than any spoof Hollywood has released in 20 years, make that 25 years (Zucker Brothers?). Oliver Stone had better bow-out and allow Anna Biller to make the Donald Trump Presidential bio-pic. She's the only one qualified to assess modern American life without resorting to a bloody sacrifice. It's like rediscovering the National Lampoon films, but womanier, sexier and smarter--skits which seem groomed not by Harvard graduates, but more seemingly Smith and the Sister schools by way of saturated cabarets on Santa Monica Boulevard and screenings at the Nuart. Somehow Viva reminds me of a melange between the work of Carol Burnett and Ulrike Ottinger. I haven't seen color like this since Technicolor I.B. prints of Tex Avery cartoons. Give her all the money in the world, just don't allow Anna Biller to stop making movies. My only complaint is that there should have been a cameo for Mary Woronov.
Checked the release date 3 times in order to be sure!
This is a very inspired, very creative flick. It was obviously made by a filmmaker who is also a cinephile. Purposefully schlocky with an eye toward feminism that is absolutely scathing to our male-dominated world. It's astounding that Biller has assembled such a large cast of people who "get it." The only downside is the length. The point is made very early on, and as much as it's more than just a novelty film, it's still a novelty film. Novelty films simply cannot fill 2 hours, which Viva struggles to do.  But as an exercise to get me pumped for The Love Witch, it's a grand success. I'll be keeping my eye on Biller. She's got the skills, the know how, and the attitude to dominate the film industry in a unique way.
That's the shit right there. Pleasure and consent 101 in a gloriously rich pastiche of 70s sexploitation. Revisits sexual politics of the 70s with a mind to disrupt our nostalgic view of the period as a free and revolutionary period for everyone involved.
Anna Biller makes me feel guilty by virtue of having been born a male. Her films practice a scorched scrotum policy as she lampoons every man as either clutching his blue balls and sulking like a whiny bitch or accusing them of being an outright rapist. Exaggerated it may seem, I wouldn't be surprised if just about every man has actually exhibited this kind of behaviour or have at least had thoughts that lie somewhere along this spectrum at one point or another. Especially through the roaring hormone fuelled years of their teens and twenties when 90% of their decisions are diverted via their penile circuitry. Hence, my own gut-wrenching guilt (on the whiny bitch end of the scale, not the rapey one). Using the aesthetic of a 70s stag film, replete with wooden acting and contrived scenarios, Anna Biller assumes the role of her lead character Barbi. Having found herself fired from her secretarial job by her ass-grabbing boss and then being walked out on by her handsome Ken-doll husband Rick, Barbi finds herself a newly liberated woman. It could not have been at a more fortunate epoch in history. By the 1970s women's liberation had reached a fever pitch and women everywhere were free to burn their bras and throw off the shackles of their patriarchal oppressors. It was a time when women could explore and express their own individual and unique identities. Right? In Viva, we see a very different picture of what that freedom amounted to. The majority of the film is focused on Barbi's picaresque adventures as she tries to find her true self. Deciding that she wants to be a model she gets passed from pillar to post in an attempt to crack into the business only to find out that with every step there is a new bridge blocked by a new troll trying a new method to convince her to crawl into the shadows with him and take off her clothes. It turns out that women's liberation is just an illusion spun by men to convert them all from housewives to whores for everyone to enjoy. To be honest I don't know if what I have written above accurately represents Anna Biller's intentions at all. I vaguely remember reading in an interview when I saw her more recent film, The Love Witch, a couple of months ago that she thought it was awful that girls were fed fantasies about chivalrous knights in shining armour on white horses sweeping them off their feet and living happily ever after only to grow up and realise that all men are basically rapists and that marriage is essentially institutional rape. I really hope that she was exaggerating just a little bit to make her point. Because if that is what it is really like to grow up a woman then that is really, really bleak and horrific. Or maybe I have incorrectly remembered what she said (and then what does that say about me?). The men in Viva form a grotesque carnival of characters. They are all so over-the-top that they almost seem to give men a way out. Nobody I know is that slimy, sleazy and lecherous, so it is quite easy for me and my friends to shrug it off and say, "Yeh, but I am not like that so I am not part of the problem" and then have a good laugh. I suspect though that Anna Biller doesn't really care whether this film makes men change or not. She has already written all of us off as assholes and she is making a movie for herself and her long suffering sisterhood. I think I better just get the fuck out of the way...! Seriously though, at the end of the day, I am in no way qualified to speak about what it is like to be a woman in this world today and/or what Anna Biller thinks about any of it. In fact, I am sure I most definitely am a part of the problem even if I think I am a nice bloke. There are probably so many things that I do and say that perpetuate gender inequality without me even realising it. After all, if women are being socialised to be oppressed, then I am being socialised to be an oppressor. I guess at the end of the day this film has got me thinking about it for a bit so maybe she is making a bit of a difference after all, one male asshole at a time.
The attention to detail in this movie is absurd and EXTREMELY impressive. Too long by about 45 minutes, but I guess that's also kind of the point.
Anna Biller is the absolute dream queen exploitation auteur. And she’s really an auteur: writing, directing, starring, designing costumes and sets, and crafting props, she works her ass off for her pictures. Viva is Biller’s first feature after years of making pastiche shorts that hearken back to the lush likes of Douglas Sirk, Mario Bava, and Herschel Gordon Lewis. Viva however is a sex comedy unlike anything since Russ Meyer. The picture follows a board housewife as she enters into a life as a prostitute, while seeking love. Viva plays like John Waters directing Belle de jour. Each scene is vibrantly colored and textured like vintage advertisements for liquor or cars or cigarettes; and each ad is directed at men. Biller subverts exploitation turning the skin flick into a statement of how women are used and lack identity in a world dominated by men. Since the '90s, cinema has had a growth in the interest in exploitation cinema of the old days (you probably know a couple of directors that have made careers out of this interest), but unlike many of the copycats and knockoffs, Biller is the real deal. One can only imagine her loosing herself for hours on end listening to the likes of Bas Sheva, gushing over old ads in Playboy, and combing LA for the gaudiest of vintage wear. Although she has made many short films, Viva was Biller’s arrival into the feature film world. It is a bold, fearless picture that will leave shag carpet burns on your skin once its done with you.
I thought Biller was going to make a parody of the sexploitation films of the 60s but no, she goes one step further and delivers a pastiche love letter for those films. Biller has an eye for the period. The costumes, the art, the colours and even the graphic design are typical of the period and the sexploitation films in particular. When Sanford and Brno sit around their pool, pour some Scotch and read Playboy, Brno announces that this is her morning coffee and news. From there on, we go on a journey of consumerism, swinging from one bed to another, caught in an idea of liberation which exists only in name. Maybe the true liberation here is the liberation from sex itself. Biller is too wooden to get the camp these films needed but otherwise she dons all her roles in this film quite well. It's a homage which refuses to go beyond the surface and give us a real critique. Yet, it is fun despite how long it is.
Smartly written.  Hilarious one-liners.  Gorgeous sets.  Brilliant.
Anna Biller's homage / pastiche / subversion of the colour-saturated softcore films of Radley Metzger and the 'nudie cuties' of the 60s and 70s has a lot more going on under the hood than mere grindhouse chic. All the pieces are in place: Self-conscious acting, burbling synth music, wooden characters with vapid dialogue, and of course a regular and healthy dollop of nudity. Break through the aesthetics though, and you can see that Biller's really taking a swipe at pretty much everything on display. From its doting, content housewives, the sleazy arrogance of its male characters, and the murky ideas of sexual revolution, it's an ickily unpleasant world that Barbie (AKA Viva) travels through on her way to, finally, some kind of self-realisation. Told straight the story would be pretty uncomfortable, but the presentation and heightened style manages to remove it to a palatable, almost fantastical realm. Some of the performers struggle to find the tone, but on the whole everyone gives it just the right amount of knowing parody, leading to some wonderfully insightful throwbacks. It's maybe a little long, but never really dull. My only regret is not being able to source a full-bodied HD version, as I'm sure it would look magnificent. Ironically the DVD is on the UK's Shameless label, which probably means they're missing the point.
Belle de Jour crossed with Confessions of a Window Cleaner. Amazing set dressing and fake product placement.
As always with Anna Biller's films, the production design of the era is completely on point, but the delivery is so one note and it doesn't have much direction making the 2 hour run time drag a whole lot - the songs don't even manage to save it at the halfway.
"I've always wanted to be a prostitute--it sounds so romantic." "You really turn me on.""I turn everybody on!" "What you're describing sounds kind of dark." "People are bored with nudity."
Femtember #16 Biller Be Brilliant. This is honestly the film about the modeling world that The Neon Demon should have been. Smart, subversive, and directed with a cleverly subtle hand. The colors pop and the performances will crack you up. The only real issue is at 2 hours the film can feel a tad on the long side. Can't wait for The Love Witch!!!
Revisionist filmmaking inside subgenres lost to the swirling vortex of TV guides from the 70's, canape cookbooks and call girl adverts. Unlocking womens sexual freedom by visiting the different aspects of sex-in-films normally male-owned paradigms and exposing their weaknesses, malevolence and buffoonery. Be your own person, alive in magic, sex and control. Gold tassles. Lemon lime patterned dresses. Vases of roses on top of gold edged cabinets. Jewel encrusted goblets. Kisses on a racing circuit. Ritualistic mondo sex parties. tiki lamps. velvet bedcovers. exotica flutes. male sex slaves. apples on a platter. anna biller isnt just a visionary. shes a weird fucking genius.
At first this film plays a little too closely as a vanity project of someone obsessed with sexploitation films of the 70's. I was waiting for it to develop jokes more overtly and parody the cliches and styles it was emulating. Really though, Anna Biller is poking fun as much as she really seems in love with the genre. For that, the film is much smarter, funnier, honest, and refreshingly earnest. It doesn't look down on the genre so much as present it as closely as the real thing, warts and all. It's a love letter and passion project, almost perfectly realized in tone, acting, writing, set, and costume design. Tongue in cheek, playful, frisky, and a little sexy. I can't think of many other films as deserving of a cult following as this. It's lovely.
A weird one this ... a film made in the last decade that for at least 20 minutes had me convinced was made forty years earlier. A tale of sexual liberation in the Swingin' Seventies told from the point of view of a woman this is authentic right down to the terrible decor and awful acting. The frequently naked lead actress is also the director and she makes a decent fist of at least one of those jobs but I'm not sure what the overall message was supposed to be.
Even after just looking at the film's posters and stills I couldn't possibly believe Viva was a 2007 movie! Then I wasn't so sure if I really wanted to watch it, but I did give it try. At the end I checked and the director Anna Biller, who also acted in her film, produced it too, and was responsible for its editing, and its production and custom design. And therefore I must say she has done a very good job with her accurate attention to details: the sets, scenarios like a nudist colony or an orgy, the clothing, the color palette used and all the rest of it manage to make Viva look totally (actually be!) alike sexploitation flicks of the 70s like any Radley Metzger's, or, say, The First Nudie Musical. Biller must have been involved even in the soundtrack selection: in the typical invasive porn OST: I could recognize some Piero Piccioni lounge-music pieces that, considering the author's mimicking rigor, I wonder whether they could be out-of-place - checking even that, I was wrong, Biller knew what she was doing! :D-. Talking about its plot, Viva is unmistakably a spoof -i.e. consider, all along its over-extended duration (2 hours!), its constant artificially mincing acting. But thanks to that, it's a bit as if the film's only aim (but could it?) is to be hilarious for its audience, the way a film like The Room is . In the end, for me Viva is so identical to the movies it sends up (only longer :D), that it's as bad as them.
Anna Biller's candy-colored sexploitation fever dream is about as smart, sexy, and consistently hilarious as feature debuts get; equal parts powerful call to action and ambitious love letter with a fetishistic attention to detail. Full review at: podcastingthemsoftly.com/2016/08/16/viva-2007-a-review-by-ryan-marshall/
I recently heard about Anna Biller's new film The Love Witch, which sounds really good, so in lieu of that coming out, I thought I would try her previous feature Viva. Viva is a sexploitation film, from a feminist perspective, that alternates at being hilarious and being so committed to its premise that it becomes dulling. The film is parody in the best way, it has its own story to tell and narrative to follow, but it distinctly wrought in the style it was conceived. The film is Douglas Sirk and Jacque Demy sets, with Russ Meyer or Radley Metzger plotting. It is hilariously acted, arch dialogue delivered absolutely flatly; and while there is a lot of nudity, there is limited sex. Most of the sleaze is limited to elaborate early-'70s pastiche clothing and amusing scenarios. Though, Biller does manage to shoehorn in a sequence at a nudist colony... The film ends with an orgy. Where a musical number is sung. That is the tone throughout. In fact, the film becomes a musical about one-hour in. The characters singing is completely out of the blue and really invigorates the second half. The only issue I had with Anna Biller's film is that at 120 minutes, it is incredibly long. It should never have been near two hours. It becomes a little tiresome before the end, even when there are really good individual scenes in the second half. However, you have to applaud Biller. She acts in it (amusingly), directs it (artistically), writes it (archly). But she also produced it, edited it, was the production designer, was involved in the music and she was the costume designer. She also worked in the art department and did the short animation sequence! It really is an auteurist vision of the clearest sort. Viva is a funny, if really overlong, parodic sexploitation musical. It makes me more interested in seeing The Love Witch as soon as possible.
Anna Biller’s melange of supremely crafted cinematic period detail and the genuinely captivating story of Barbie/Viva’s journey through a very particular swinging 60’s cinescape is the work of a unique artist doing something quite fascinating, but also very entertaining with the aesthetics of genre cinema. Of course Viva is hilarious and humour plays a large part given the form and tropes which Biller uses to tell her tale. But what’s fascinating is the level of authentic detail in conjuring up a world that never existed beyond the screen. The vision is authentic, yet only tenuously related to reality. Yet this is no facile ‘wink-wink’ retro homage. Nothing is for purely superficial effect and Barbie/Viva’s journey is broached in a manner unlikely during the cinematic period that the film is harking back to, yet the specific tropes alluded to and the detail employed creates in conjunction with the modern telling of the story something quite wonderfully singular. Of course in an actual b-movie about swinging and wild parties in 60’s America the housewife who dared to step outside of her suburban hausfrau role would inevitably be punished by 'fate' come the end credits! Anna Biller (with her seemingly ever present blue eye shadow!) is excellent as both hemmed in housewife Barbie and Goddess Viva. Bathing is simply impossible without drinking and smoking at the same time. I loved the very Beyond the Valley of the Dolls looking party/orgy scene and Viva’s siren song is awesome and so is the animated interlude. I’m now really looking forward to seeing Biller’s new film The Love Witch at Frightfest!
It's like a bunch of Greek gods hosted a feast during which they consumed a lot of wine, and a lot of pineapple, and everything I love about movies and also every movie I love, and then had this massive orgy, and they ejaculated this all over my heart and soul.
Hilarious 70'ies sexcomedy about the so-called sexual revolution in California, unfortunately only for men. Told from the viewpoint of two housewives. Entertaining to the end.
a wonderfully colour film. on a side note, i appreciated how the film distinguished between the consensual sex scenes (fading out before the act) and the rape scenes (not fading out and showing the act). I have to remove half a star for Mark's fucking GRATING, fucking DECIMATING, fucking SOUL CRUSHINGLY repetitive laugh. That laugh alone made me want to turn the film off and end my life (more than usual). Luckily, it goes away after the first fifteen minutes or so. I'm almost happy I spent $31.50 on this EX-RENTAL dvd... Now I'm definitely looking forward to seeing The Love Witch at MIFF next month :)
Anna Biller is making the films of my dreams and, as utterly amusing as this movie is, you can tell she takes all of her influences seriously and approaches them with genuine love instead of ironic kitsch. It makes a world of difference, resulting in one of the best tributes to the greats of the sexploitation era (Metzger and Meyer among others) because it works on three levels: as a tribute to them, as a subtle critique of them, and as a film that would fit in beautifully alongside them.
More pain-staking homage than loosey-goosey parody, and that makes all the difference. You can see so much care, and knowledge here. I was afraid this would just be a slapdash, goofy one-note joke. But man, this is fun. A bit long, but still.
a women’s picture thriving within an homage to a genre (sexploitation) that is often exploitative of women; and that’s exactly the point. takes place during the sexual revolution in the ‘70s – which it theoretically praises, but more importantly, acknowledges that many (mainly men, unsurprisingly) took advantage of it – and allows its female protagonist’s sexual desires and curiosities to run wild in a Sirkian journey through a wide array of then-taboo subject matter. vitally sidesteps a mere winky parody, instead showing both an appreciation and understanding of the genre: the colorful production design and meticulously stilted dialogue alone place this miles ahead of the genre’s countless phony homages, but it additionally derives humor from the absurdity of the era while integrating the genuinely apt ambience of the genre and Biller's own personally idiosyncratic approach.
A thoroughly entertaining and colourful film, which is a sort of homage to the sexploitation movies of the late sixties and seventies. Anna Biller, who also wrote and directed it, stars as the main character Barbi AKA Viva. In what has been called a "post-feminist 70's era B flick exploitation homage film" . Everyone gives these rather amateurish performances as they strut around in bright 70s clothes and mainly dodgy wigs. The films' that it plagiarizes i haven't seen! For me it was like a more sedate and less edited Russ Meyer movie! After reading interviews with Anna Biller, she doesn't even mention Meyer but interestingly enough she does mention Peter Walker, who made some British sex comedies in the early 70s. But this film does remind me of Candy (1968) with it's lecherous men lusting after the main lead and none of them really have any redeeming features. It is all made in a studio and the sets are matched with the costumes the actors wear. It does look like an animated Play Boy magazine from the 1970s. Anna Biller pouts and flutters her eye leashes as her neighbor Rick (Chad England), falsely laughs loudly at his rather pointless 'jokes'. She has a some what Tura Satana look to her but her character isn't as strong in stature. There is a number of songs sang by the three main protagonists and even a psychedelic cartoon with some symbolic apples! There is lots of nudity, but these people look real and from this period of time, so that is nicely suitable for the retro feel of the film. There isn't any plastic implanted breast or men posing, showing off six packs. It does oddly and subtly 'comment' on the use of drugging people for sex which happens twice in this film. Also she is raped and then acts like nothing happen and if the act was her doing as if this is a part of her discovering and reveling in her sexuality. Lots of odious hippies who use their mantra of free love, just to get laid and all the artistic men are English and very sleazy. There is a Kenneth Tynan type character who is staging a nude stage musical too. The version i saw was the 18 rated DVD or the un-rated American version, which was a little too long and somewhat dragged in places. But all that said and done, it was very enjoyable for the detail in the set design, make up and costumes and silliness of the characters.
What starts out as fairly boring and irritating, slowly comes in to focus and ends up being ok. It is a bit ridiculous and the fake laughing gets very annoying, but overall it is actually well-made and makes its point subtly.
Not gonna lie -- this was hilarious. Loved it.
And just like that, I was all caught up on the films of Sam Bologna.
Uh, happy Women History Month? :/
Sexual freedom can also mean freedom from sex. So this is one of these pastiche movies, but unlike say Black Dynamite (to pick a beloved movie that I love to hate), there's never the sense that Anna Biller (writer/director/editor/star/costume and set designer) is making fun of the set of movies to which VIVA is pointing (Joe Sarno sin-in-the-suburbs sexploitation, nudist camp quickies, Radley Metzger high society sleaze, Beyond the Valley of the Dolls, etc). Instead this movie wears their artifice as a deliberate way of calling attention to the bogus "freedoms" and "liberated attitudes" of an era that still prioritized men's desires and objectified women. There's still plenty of "that's so 70s!" goofin' and the cadence of the stilted dialogue, while period accurate, gets a bit thin after 120 minutes, but this is generally a smart, thoughtful use of imagery and tropes that works simultaneously as a celebration and a deconstruction.
Sirk/Metzger/Meyer/Waters I don't even fucking know. Where has this been all my life?
I always like when a film doesn't attempt to completely destroy the tropes of what came before, but fully embraces them while subtly poking at their issues. That being said, I think this film might offend some people as it is wholeheartedly 1960's nudie cutie as the Editor is 1970s Giallo. So the film has a completely different outlook on the world when compared to more modern ones. At its heart, this is the story of a woman named Barbie who's marriage falls apart and winds up becoming a call girl named Viva, and chronicling the adventures (and frankly surprising number of rapes) she encounters on her way. A number of the people situations she deals with are quite funny, and all of them are quite strange. Most of the film is Barbie/Viva wandering ahead and getting into some sort of odd situation, almost like a screwball comedy style plot. Biller is the only director who I feel is up to par with Wes Anderson on set decoration and design. Everything from costume to random junk sitting around either is or looks vintage. There is some absolutely brilliant mid century design evident in this film. I'm personally most partial to the overly sleazy den of the artist, as well as several of the outfits Barbie has. The best is one that appears to be a dress where the top is crocheted. It really doesn't get more 1970 than that. With the current growing interests in the 70's, I wouldn't be surprised if this one has a gain in popularity after The Love Witch comes out. I feel really sorry for the guys playing the husbands for having to eat the mid century party food. Also I'm a little worried about some of the bit actors. They did so well with the mannerisms and movements of film characters from the period that I just can't help but feel they watch way too many of them. Its a lot of fun. By the way, I watched the unrated version. There is only one sex scene in it, and the majority of the nudity is in the scene at the nudist camp. So for those where that would be a turn off don't need to overly worry. If you can make it through opening the dvd without being offended you'll be fine...  *******A few minor spoilers here*********** To me, the film is a view of the issues of the past. Barbie's path is never much in doubt, and much of what happens to her is based on her gender. As much as she wants to be a truly liberated woman, when it gets beyond sex there is no place for her in the world. Towards the end, she even learns that she was all alone in her actions, that the women she thought shared her lifestyle do not. It simply wasn't proper. There is a scene late in the film that would seem to cement in this reading. In it one of the various sleazy characters addresses the camera about the role of men in the world. He talks about how great everything is, and how one day all of this will change. Even the men in the film know that the way things were could not stay forever. Viva just appeared a little too early, and allowed the wrong people to think for her. This film is almost a swan song for the age before feminism. It shows how even when a woman tried, she could never fully escape the control of men. Watching this film is an insight into an earlier, almost unfathomable age. Viewing it as such, this could be one of the most anti-nostalgia nostalgia films I have seen. It shows that it is possible to recreate the past, but also asks the question of why? And at the same time its a funny mid century sex comedy. With better acting than some of the movies from the period. Now I'm REALLY looking forward to the Love Witch.  (One final note, its a very un-sexy sex film, which reminds me of Guilty of Romance. I think there is something to a comparison of these films, and they would make an excellent double feature. here is so much to unpack in both of these films and they follow a similar plot line. Even though one is technically a comedy and the other is a Sion Shono film.)
This film is so good yet I'm sure there will be many unable to truly enjoy it as I have (and will again) because of its daring and its honesty and to be honest its historical setting. Anna Biller has brilliantly and lovingly created an homage (with feminist overtones) to late 60s/early 70s sexploitation. She stars, a little uncomfortably, it has to be said, though this works for the film, and even disrobes for her art. The set designs, the art on the walls and even an animated sequence (brilliant) are all her own work and stunning it all is. This looks, sounds and feels like a product of the time and I can understand youngsters just finding it all funny but for me it is like stepping into a very knowing time capsule and entering a very thoughtful look as what appears so trivial. There is much nudity, much wooden acting, truck loads of bright and garish colours and lots of limp dialogue vaguely pontificating a world seemingly changing forever but in reality a speck, an aberration, a unique moment in time, perfectly captured. Enjoy if you dare!
Written, directed and starring Anna Biller, "Viva" comes across as a lost sexploitation flick from the early '70s despite it being produced in 2007. Biller based the incredible, psychedelic look of "Viva" on late '60s decorating books and Playboy magazine to come up with a fabulously distinctive, eye-popping film where the design, clothes and colour are an integral part of the story and the story-telling. Biller plays Barbi, a bored housewife in 1972 suburbia who is married to Mark (Jared Sanford) and is close friends with neighbours Sheila (Bridget Brno) and Rick (Chad England). When Mark abandons Barbi at home to go off on a business / leisure trip, Barbi and Sheila decide its time to get rid of their bras and head out on the town in search of excitement and the sexual revolution. Barbi, who rechristens herself Viva ("I want to be called Viva, which in Italy means "to live." Because that's what I want to do now - to live!"), quickly finds herself swept into an orgiastic maelstrom of sex, hippies, nudist camps, drugs, orgies, bisexuality and general bohemian decadence. Anna Biller's film is a magnificent, subversive and satirical exploration of gender issues and female empowerment within the context of an brilliantly constructed sexploitation film, making the resulting film possibly a one-of-a-kind feminist sexploitation movie. Biller explores the differences between the needs and desires of women and men and subtly portrays issues of gender conflict. She stabs at the gender imbalance that was inherent within the "sexual revolution"; her dialogue demonstrating these issues is both clever and pointed. Rick's monologue, straight to camera, is a great case in point: "There's never been a better time to be a man. The willing women. The dandy clothes. The frills. The big rings and jewellery. The open shirts. The sense of entitlement. Take it from me: savour this time. For it will soon be gone, never to return". The acting is excellent throughout, it's strange slightly hysterical pitching adding to the surreal allure of the film. Overall "Viva" is one of the best film's I've seen in a while. It's stunning look, design and vibrant colour palette being the base on which Anna Biller has built a brilliant b-movie sexploitation pastiche and parody. It is more than simply parody, however, being also a story of self-awareness, sexual discovery and gender politics. That Biller has managed so effectively to combine a stunningly accurate sexploitation homage and imbue it with a satirical, subversive, intellectual feminist edge is a remarkable achievement.
Very dull, mostly just a series of unfunny stereotypes. this has been referred to as a "feminist" film, but Barbie is such a weak gullible lead, that you would find stronger female characters in a Russ Meyer films, or actual 70's exploitation flicks. Also the amount of fake laughter is so tiresome, I understand it is supposed to be a parody as the 70's was chalked full of unnecessary laughter, but it really is not funny. piss poor attempt at pseudo nostalgia for the golden era of cinema. This required a lot of patience to get through.
Now this is the quirky feminist director people should be putting on a pedestal instead of Lena Dunham. One posits a female point of view while naked and snarling, lampooning the male’s place in society but in a way that refuses to be civil, pointing one finger while clenching the rest. If you disagree, it’s because you’re sexist. And the other one says the same thing but knows how to have fun and utilize her talent in a non-aggressive way. You know, maybe we can talk about this kind of stuff and not get into a fight. Guess which one people take more seriously. Nepotism makes a world of difference, it seems. The skilled Anna Biller, however, is a breath of fresh air. Someone who can direct, edit, produce, write, make the costumes and sets for (both of which are impeccable, btw), animate and compose songs for, and star in a sexploitation movie in the 21st century, giving us a Boogie Nights with less plotholes and purposeful bad acting (just being honest); someone who is able make a piece of art and have it speak for itself without self-aggrandizing and taking the war to Twitter - simply "this is the movie, this is the statement, enjoy it or don’t, hi mom" - is someone we should have more respect for and I feel ashamed that I’ve only just now stumbled upon her. Instead of mumbling that there’s nothing new to try so let’s just Frances Ha, she gives us Viva, a movie so stylish and saturated in 1972 gaudiness, complete with flowery game-show jazz soundtrack and intensely bright set design, that you forget it was made in 2007. Why has it been 7 years and we’ve not given her carte blanche to make whatever the hell she wants yet? Taking a break from the discussion portion of the class, is it a perfect movie? By no means. But I’m in awe of a person who knows how to make a movie feel good, where the only glaring flaw I can think of off the top of my head is that it runs a bit too long. Maybe it doesn't say enough but I wouldn't consider that a flaw because, as a moviegoer, I need to remind myself that I'm not entitled to a script that says what I'm thinking. When someone gets close enough, though, I'm willing to rate it higher out of respect.
Satire? Homage? Recreation? VIVA does a remarkable job recreating the look and much of the style of 70s sexploitation movies. At an hour it might have been a fun little homage to the genre. Going on and on for two hours, it creates a rather dystopian story of free love. Cool music.
Entertaining....even if I'm not 100% sure what I just watched. Purposely bad acting and great costume and set design. Enough nudity and a variety of sex to keep most males engaged. I could of done without the constant jazzy background music, however.
Although it gets more of a rating than some of the dross I've seen, it's mainly for the set design and costumes. The performances are intentionally wooden in a Victoria Wood's 'Acorn Antiques' fashion with a plot and script to match. This is troublesome partly because the cast are completely unknown so you're never sure whether they're putting on this performance or if they're genuinely this wooden. This level of spoofery backfires horribly unfortunately due to these shortcomings and it gets incredibly tiring to watch without checking the time.
Good for what it is. Radley Metzger meets John Waters badly acted hokey sexploitation period film. Nostalgic cinephiles should enjoy this brightly colored farce.
Overlong and preserved in aspic it may be, this is worth watching just for the irrepressible performance of Jared Sanford; I salute you with a Dewars on the rocks, you magnificently crazed sleazy bastard. Strictly for the cognoscenti, but Biller may be one to watch in the future. (Review by Jason Abbey) www.themoviewaffler.com/2014/02/dvd-review-viva-2007.html
If you're a fan of sexploitation films from the 1960's, Viva is perfect for you! A throwback to these films in a similar way to Death Proof/Planet Terror, Hobo With A Shotgun and Black Dynamite but with a strong focus on the cheeky sex films of the time. If you're a fan of films from directors such as Russ Meyer (particularly SuperVixens), sexploitation and throwback movies then you should definetly check this one out. It recieved some fantastic reviews from critics upon it's release and I totally agree with it. A great fun film that pays homage to the rather cheeky films of the 60s.
I don't know whether to laugh at the camp and self-deprecation of Anna Biller or marvel at her simply amazing retro styling. Every prop, every shot, every plot point, even the food served, is so convincing it's hard to remember it was made this century.
visually perfect reproduction of 1970' kitch, acting was toooooo forced which was not funny after the first 3 minutes
Alexander Payne's downsizing worked for me, it was funny, it had ideas. It wasn't the best film he's made but it was a pretty solid political satire about how modern capitalism will get more efficient but still be based on exploitation, will isolate you, and still ruin the planet.   Seriously, what was with the music.
This movie started out fine, but it got stereotypical and predictable and cheesy and boring if I'm being honest. I didn't really want to finish watching it but I did just because I felt an obligation to.
This movie had no idea what it wanted to be. I gave it 2.5 because there were a lot of good moments and a lot of possibilities but this was horribly paced, deceitfully marketed, and borderline schizophrenic in message, tone, and quality.
Deeply rich and under-appreciated. A twisting satire of the ways in which we get caught up in marrying the idea of our future happiness to systemic structures like capitalism, politics, and religion as we miss the deep wells of meaning right in front of our faces.
Stop this movie after the first act and you actually have a pretty good short film
This is an interesting one. The initial premise is absolutely genius. Obviously, the concept of shrinking people isn't an new one for films to be dealing with. But using it for environmental reasons but from the point of view of the average person, for capitalist values of being richer and being able to buy more stuff. All this sounds like it's going to add up to a pretty good and very interesting film and it does... for about 45 minutes. After this, the film takes a deep dive down many little tangential rabbit holes and make the film seem confused and muddled. The film is too self-obsessed with its message and the feelings of Matt Damon to capitalise on the basic raw genius of its premise. Which is truly a shame.
i’ll never understand payne’s cheap sentimentalism or why he constantly undercuts it with even cheaper humor like the horrendous “what kind of fuck” monologue first 45 minutes or so are pretty interesting but the above complaints plus rolfe kent’s supremely boring score makes most of the film’s novel elements pretty hard to enjoy
There should be some kind of a law against wasting such interesting premises and ideas in such a bland fashion. A massive disappointment from Alexander Payne.
This probably should’ve been either a comedy about Kristen wiig and Matt Damon downsizing or a drama about ngoc’s struggles from her pov. Instead it’s a lil bit of everything and it’s pretty weird.
A soggy, off-putting piece of work, only enlivened by a few fun performances. (As a very specific note: This movie has more puzzling screenwriting decisions than I've encountered in a long time, from opening with 10 solid minutes of slow-ass exposition to the inconsistency of Matt Damon's character.)
Honey, I shrunk the Eat, Pray, Love.
I want to be tiny and ride my dachshund around like a dragon
This film had such a strong beginning and yet the concepts and plots introduced dissipated by the end of the film. In many ways I felt as though I was watching two separate films and wished I could go back to former than latter. This was a hybrid of genres and yet the combination did not transition well. There’s nothing wrong with hybrid genres but I felt like Alexander Payne could not make up his mind as to whether or not this was a romantic comedy or drama. The plot is definitely original and made me wonder what would our society be like if Downsizing was actually real? The disllusionment of Paul (Matt Damon) felt believeable and trying to cope with his new environment after his wife divorces him felt real and left me at the edge of seat wondering what is next for Paul and his life. Looking back now I regret to say I wish I hadn’t ask that question. The minute they introduced Ngoc Lan Tran (Hong Chau) the story went to utter garbage. I have nothing against her acting but the horrific Vietnamese accent (sounded more like redneck hillbilly) was annoying and the stereotypes of Orientalism pervaded immensive with her relationship with Paul. With Ngoc Lan Tran I thought the plot would shift to a drama and having Paul uncover the systematic racism and poor treatment of minorities that would showcase this “Leisureland” is simply a scam and nothing has changed for humans but that whole arc of the story gets glossed over as Ngoc Lan Tran becomes the Savior complex for Minorities. Out of nowhere the characters go to the original colony that begin this whole phenomenon and immediately we get topics of the world ending and survival for mankind and other nonsense that made me pause and wonder... isn’t the world going to end in a couple of hundred years? Why are these people acting like it’s going to happen tomorrow and the fact that we have no conclusive time period in the film made it extremely over the top and the ending felt completely forgettable. As I am writing this now I’ve forgotten 85% of what I just watched.  I wouldn’t recommend this film unless you want to watch the first half and come up with your own conclusions as to how does this movie end. Either way it’s definitely better than what Alexander Payne created.
i mean the 135 minutes of worldbuilding were great and all but where is the plot ?? WHERE IS THE PLOT ??
fake deep matt damon is just *insert that gif of Tiffany Pollard rubbing her temples* too much
Not bad gold to watch on a rainy day. Felt a little long.
While I never had high hopes for the film, 'Downsizing' isn't exactly the film the marketing would have you believe it is. The trailers looked mildly amusing and at least kind of fun, but the movie deals with the ideas of human extinction, global warming, white privilege, and other things that are generally not as much fun. Add all that together and you have a film that struggles to find a voice and a consistent tone, things that are pretty detrimental to the movie as a whole. On a mostly unrelated note, are we seeing the beginning of the end of Matt Damon's career as an A-lister? He's made some comments to the press these past few months that a lot of people have found unsavory, he starred in this, he was in 'The Great Wall' in 2016 that drew a lot of controversy, 'Suburbicon' wasn't very good, even the latest 'Jason Bourne' wasn't very good. I suppose we'll see.
Paul Safranek: He never struck me as the kind of guy who'd go get small. Wow! I want to track down Alexander Payne and be like: what happened here?  The concept for this film is interesting. Matt Damien is a very charismatic charming actor. Christoph Waltz is one of the best actors on the planet. So you take that interesting premise and great actors and make one of the most boring films I’ve ever seen.  It took me two days to watch it because I fell asleep, not a great sign. Normally when I criticize a film I ask questions like why did they do this or why did they do that. This movie: I don’t care. I’m just glad it over.
I love Matt Damon so I watched this and I'm glad because now I love Hong Chau. I saw her in Homecoming before I saw her in this and they did her dirty in this. I despise that she was directed or it was written for her to talk that way, but I guess I get it. I guess it's for comedic purposes, and I guess they think they made up for it by giving her a GG nomination. Either way, she is brilliant and I can't wait to see her in more stuff. Christoph is too good for this but I guess he's there because he's a "fan of the director" like Matt and of course, the check. The story and movie isn't as shit as critics make it out to be. It's cheesy and corny but also kinda cute.   *Saying 'guess' a lot on purpose*
Man, what a wasted concept! This movie could've benefited from being about a half hour shorter. The first half with the downsizing itself was fascinating, then you completely forget anyone is small at all and it turns into Walter Mitty for no reason. I didn't hate either half. It just felt like two half baked movies that could've both been great had they not been half explored. 2/6
Hong Chau is a good actor. I don't know why they needed to make her accent so strong and not completely believable.
Not what you expect. Starts off interesting and intriguing and slowly turns into a puzzled "hunh?!?!?!". Cast was good. Hong Chau steals every scene...the 8 fucks was awesome. I had more questions of how the smalls produced certain items and goods. Decent amount of humor throughout.
This should have been a book.
This should’ve been Hong Chau’s story
This film was surprising and I didn’t hate it.  It was a sci-fi comedy love story that took such a hard left turn I legit might have hit my head.  Here are my reasons for liking this film in order: 1) HONG FREAKING CHAU 2) Christoph Waltz 3) Jason Sudeikis .......  10) Matt Damon. Honestly, I know people were pretty vocal about not liking downsizing and I get it.  It is a DARK comedy that has overtly Christian themes while also involving Christoph waltz as a playboy and the word fuck being said 30 times. There seem to be two VERY opposed audiences that this film is trying to appeal to. There are a 2 main redeeming points for me in this film: 1) an interracial love story 2) a relationship between an able and disable couple that is NOT a tragedy where the disabled person commits suicide (still bitter about Me Before You, clearly). Is it perfect?  CUSS NO! But it is trying and is pretty funny, so I am not about to hate on it!
The only enjoyable part of this film was Hong Chau.
What a bizarre misfire. I watched on Amazon Prime. I was complete with this movie for the first hour, It was strange, funny, and was starting to make fascinating statements about class, privilege, and wealth. Why such smart writers (Payne and Taylor) couldn't figure out where to take the story will vex me for some time.
This might possibly be the worst movie I’ve ever seen
Takes the path least expected of its premise, and while that has the benefit of keeping things unpredictable, it also doesn't really do anything interesting or funny with it. Moralizing and preachy instead of clever and satirical, the film seems more concerned with sermonizing viewers on the dangers of climate change and class warfare than putting a sardonic spin on miniaturization technology. The narrative turns it takes in the second and especially third acts are downright baffling, and the introduction of Hong Chau's character, while obviously well-intentioned, can't help but feel performatively woke and borderline racist. Would rather the film just stayed with Christoph Waltz and Udo Kier's partying Serbs - at least they livened things up.
Extremely uneven film that tackles consistently engaging and pertinent themes in the most meandering way possible. The themes about overpopulation, human connection, and finding your way in the world are all heartfelt and affecting with a lot of thought put into them, but the execution feels messy and the film's runtime drags out the underdeveloped tensions in the story for a long time. The excellent cast is game for the material, unfortunately the material dries up about sixty minutes in, instead replaced with an existential dourness about the state of the world. Hong Chau's character is the best example of the film's good intentions not quite working out. The prevalence of accents, and the language barriers that come with, in the film is notable, and Chau undoubtedly has the strongest accent, and as a result, the most stereotypical. Part of me suspects that Payne's idea was to rub audiences the wrong way, especially since Chau's character is easily the strongest and most interesting in the movie, and conceptually this plays well with the film's most striking themes of interpersonal relationships beyond language, economic, or personal barriers. In practice, it might not be as successful or half as clever as the film thinks. The movie's plot feels remarkably weightless despite the various questions and posed and plot threads teased. The first forty-five minutes or so are fairly breezy and set up the world of Downsizing very efficiently, but the movie's habit of drifting scene-to-scene with no compelling action, emotional or physical, to ground it makes for a sloppy movie that wears its heart on its chest, but keeps its most pointed thoughts intensely private. Damon's character is a waif, and while Payne is perhaps one of the directors best suited to breathe life into a dopey white man, Damon feels vacant and the script does the bare minimum to extend meaning to his character. Despite the movie's numerous problems, I respected it heavily for its ambition and willingness to address issues with a humanistic bent. It's not a movie about personal glory, saving the world, or overcoming great adversity. It's a high-concept, low-key movie about how we utilize the space around us, how, who, and why we interact with the people in our lives, and how we can live our lives in the face of unstoppable climate devastation. Payne's a fascinating filmmaker who is all about human connection. I don't quite think this story, although written by him, is his bag, but the themes it explores are well worth discussing and analyzing.
Just a full two hours of slowly losing respect for a lot of talented people.
I was hoping for more of a “Honey, I Shrunk Matt Damon” type of movie.  I enjoyed the first half but it went in a weird self-serious direction that was neither entertaining or satisfying.
United Artists Court Street 12
Looks like I’m the only one that could completely relate to this movie. Great story, relatible, hilarious! I even cried wow fantastic movie!
Pretty cute film with a nice message , some lovable characters and the story takes some unexpected turns ... I think it could’ve been a better in some ways but overall 👍🏼
Like an incoherent genre mash-up, this movie just didn’t know what it wanted to be. I appreciated its attempt to promote philanthropy, but the whole thing was all over the place thematically, and poorly executed. It wasn’t ever a problem suspending my disbelief in regard to how none of this would actually work economically, politically, or scientifically as suggested, in more ways than the obvious. It was the lack of having a unified story. It really is a shame. I really enjoyed the idea of exploring the concept. I just didn’t jive with the delivery at all. Common Payne. You’re better than this.
Interesting premise with a loud environmental theme, but possibly the worst third and fourth act ever.
This goofy movie has some genuinely moving moments.
"What kind of fuck you give me?"  I can't believe the choices that were made in this film in front of & behind the camera. The tone of this is tragic, the characters are absolute garbage & at times utterly embarrassing, & the writing is almost traumatic to the human mind. In moments that are meant to be weightful with emotion play off as some weird dark comedy? I don't understand what was trying to be accomplished here. I will never forget this in the worst way possible. An interesting concept with an execution that is beyond disaster.
Who turned Alexander Payne into Hippie Jason Reitman? This is the biggest budget Payne has ever been given and the whole thing just looks and moves like shit. The special effects aren't lit properly. The shots are bland. It's a movie with a sci-fi premise, but taking place in ordinary locations with flat lighting. And Payne decides to devote the last hour lecturing to us about the environment rather than dramatizing any of this. If you're going to flaunt your environmental concerns, maybe try not descending into racism with your Vietnamese character straight out of an old SNL skit. Only a director this talented can whiff this hard.
From the half to the end its just a blur. But interesting beginning.
Downsizing. Alexander Payne has made some excellent small budget movies that take place in America’s heartland. With Downsizing, he scales up to a 70 million dollar flick. People, in particular Matt Damon’s everyman character, willingly shrink down to 5 inches. People, in particular Downsizing’s everyman character, leave Omaha after they shrink. That’s a bad idea for both Matt Damon and Downsizing’s narrative. Payne does best when he sticks to what he knows best, Nebraska. 2.59 on the Stumeter.
Honey, I Shrunk Our Carbon Footprint
it's ok I guess
That third act was so bizarre it diminished the super interesting concept and Twilight Zone-esque vibe. Needed more Kristen Wiig!
It was entertaining, made well, and I don’t regret watching it. It definitely veered quickly into unexpected territory and ran too long.
Just average. Half black comedy, half straight drama.
This movie has the potential to be so much better. I wish Kristin Wiig was in it more, she funny as hell. The concept behind it is super interesting even though a rainstorm would kill all of the little people, and 1 bird could eat like 5 of them at a time. Also, humans becoming little is good for the environment, but it's way too far gone so our little bodies wouldn't be able to handle what's coming our way.
Wow I hated this movie so much
It was Friday and I thought I'll watch this and see something like Marvel's Ant-Man (I didn't read pretty much anything of it like I never do because its spoils the watching experience), instead I saw something else. This is exactly what I want from my scifi: science and feelings, lots of big questions and thoughts and a world that's been designed with care. Almost everything worked in this, they just sometimes forgot they're actually small and the proportions especially when arriving to Norway were completely forgotten (I'm not talking about that one village, I'm talking about when they're sailing to there, unless they have downsized whole Norway or exactly that one fjord). Aside from that one quite unforgivable mistake, I liked this movie a lot. I hate it than when this genre's movies have all the possibilities to everything, where they forget all the details and world building? Movies like this are an example how it's very possible to do it in a quite normal length. This was an interesting mix of low-tuned comedy, drama and scifi. From the comedic details I remember that after the downsizing they were picked with spatula and taken to the recovery room. From the political things I remember equality issues (human trafficking in FedEx boxes), from scifi things how they showed the process itself (picking tooths etc), and purely because of aesthetic things how humans look funny when they don't have eye brows. All the actors were good, many times I laughed especially to the characters of Hong Chau and Christoph Waltz. The main character himself, played by Matt Damon, was probably left neutral on purpose. Anime comes to my mind because in them the main characters seem to always been impersonal, probably to create an everyman-effect so that we can concentrate in to the story itself and that side characters bring the story and the world alive. It's debatable is there any sense because... well why to have a main character then? But it's a completely different story. The ending was good. It was predictable (unlike the story so far), but in a good way. The other solution could have worked too but only if this movie would have been made differently or at least have a different tone in it. To this story, it was a great choice. Excellent scifi movie, it's refreshing because I'm almost always disappointed to the movies in this genre.
Unexpectedly good.
Points for original concept that was unfortunately completely wasted. This could've worked so well as a satire on consumerism and modern society but they went off on a stupid tangent. Huge disappointment.
Nope
Downsizing was a very strange movie and I don't really understand what it is or why it exists. It could have been called "Honey, I Shrunk My Mid-Life Crisis". Seriously, this is mostly Matt Damon's life falling apart and him having to figure out who he is now but oh yeah also some people are 5-inches tall, which the movie has to remind you of every so often with (admittedly pretty good) visual gags.  Downsizing really gets going in its second half when Damon meets Hong Chau, whose political dissident -turned -cleaning woman is not only an actual character but an interesting one at that! If this was her movie and in the middle she encountered Damon's character instead of the other way 'round, that's a better movie. Nothing against Matt Damon, who I like just fine, but his character is just boring. Not just that, he's passive, which is Screen Writing No-No Number One. For the most part, everyone he encounters is more interesting that him, but they're also more active. They want things, they do things, you can enjoy them because they give the appearance of substance.  Downsizing reminds me of watered-down Don DeLillo, whose stories feature relatable human drama amidst uncanny events, but unlike Downsizing the two narrative threads will have a sort of thematic resonance. They will harmonize in some way. Downsizing never felt like it appropriately married the "finding yourself" stuff with the "five inches tall" stuff. The script (by director Alexander Payne & Jim Taylor) pays lip service to environmental issues, but literally everything about how they're five inches tall feels like an afterthought. Like, could I rewrite fucking The Graduate but everyone's got a third eye for some reason?  I'd advise you to skip Downsizing except that Hong Chau's performance is legitimately really, really good. So just fast forward until she starts showing up. And for whatever reason, it felt like I was watching it f-o-r-e-v-e-r, so fast fowarding could only help.
Cool concept, HORRIBLE execution. Plot is not good at all.
This film was about 2 hours too long. Could have been good, wasn't.
Wow!  Most true movie fans can ignore bad science if you hide it under enough good story and acting.  They took an interesting concept and buried it with preachy climate change nonsense.  It just made me sleepy.  I’m glad I waited to stream it.
The whole small thing is cool for about 30 minutes. Then halfway you're annoyed and over it. Story as a whole is very shallow
this is essentially a midlife crisis movie with very small people. it’s so midlife crisis that it takes like 1 hour and 40 minutes for paul to catch a single W. i thought this movie was pretty good and i don’t think it deserves the hate that it gets. i wish the movie stuck with what it was going for in the first half tho
Intriguing plot made me press play. Afterward: Hmm.... perhaps I will give this another watch in a bit and see how I feel about it then.
Fuck the haterz.  Downsizing slaps. I felt so many ~ emotions ~.  THE WHOLE MOVIE - I COULDN’T STOP THIKING:                    WOULD I BE BIG OR SMALL?  THE ANSWER: BIG FOREVER BABY. IMAGINE BEING THE LAST BIG BOY. YOU COULD BE LIKE GODZILLA. YOU WOULD LITERALLY BE THE MOST POWERFUL PERSON IN THE WORLD.  DARE I SAY SQUEAKUEL?
Alexander Payne has made some incredible films that I’ve enjoyed immensely, such as Sideways and Election. The concept seemed like a unique idea for him to tackle next and could lend itself to plenty of comedic ideas while also delivering dark humor and scathing satire that he is best known for. But Downsizing is unfortunately an ambitious disaster. I appreciate when a film takes twist and turns that I was not expecting but this film takes its plot into unsatisfying territories. Matt Damon is not only miscast but his character in general might just be the least interesting person any movie could offer. As the lead you get the sense that’s he isn’t actually acting but just spouting out lines at ease.  Alexander Payne’s films are simple yet incredibly effective, but with this being a high concept story the effects and presentation are executed unfortunately very poorly. The look of this film shows that Payne is very inexperienced when it comes to visual effects. As soon as the film first presents a person who has downsized its pretty jarring and unconvincing. As for the concept of downsizing I didn’t really buy it, it’s obviously such a terrible idea that no one would actually want to do. But the film never pokes fun at it instead in the end it proves to be the fucking solution for the human race and not for comedic effects. Oddly I felt like Downsizing  took itself to seriously and just wasn’t funny enough and when the film attempted a joke it didn’t stick its landing because the humor is very far and between.
This was a fine film. I’m truly amazed at the backlash this one received. I found it unpredictable and oddly fascinating. It never reaches levels of perfection but it is a nice little movie made by nice people.
It’s like Cameron Crowe meets Wim Wenders. In a good way.
Saddling your drama about a divorcée's mid-life crisis with an oversized gimmick demonstrates an aversion to risk.
I didn’t expect to like this film. Thought it would be another preaching to the choir movie when in fact it turned out to be way deeper than that. It’s been a while since a movie kept me surprised, and this one did, I kind of loved how every time I thought it had arrived at some kind of ideological message or I could see where the story was going to land, it would take a turn to probe a little deeper. If anything it seemed to be about finding humanity beyond ideology, or personal responsibility beyond ideological identification. Kind of love the screenplay. I also like the tone it maintained while simultaneously being cutting, loving, satirical, celebratory, funny and intelligent. A great fable
Not a good borrowers story. Did someone spend too much time playing fallout?
Matt Damon should never play the normal guy again. He's great when he plays someone exceptional—Will Hunting, Mike McDermott, Mark Watney—and looks normal doing it. But watching such a normal person be a normal person is old, and ruining his career. I understand why folks hated this, but truth is—I'd happily watch it again. Hong Chau is delightful (despite the broken English . . . when will we be done?!). The concept is great, Vera Farmiga is great, Christoph Waltz is great. Damon sucks. The rest is great.
Bite size Fallout mod that is just terrible.
I totally missed this in theaters and managed to catch this on HULU just the other day. I was struck by how deceptive the advertising campaign for Downsizing appears to be. I remember looking at the trailers in the theater and on Youtube and getting the impression this was going to be a lighthearted, goofy semi-comedy where the notion of shrinking life was going to be the driver or "hook" for the film's plot. As it turns out, that is far from being the case. Downsizing really isn't a comedy, although it has some funny moments. Here's the thing; Downsizing really isn't about shrinking people at all. It's a fantasy about divorce, economics, the environment, and scarcity. Downsizing orients itself along the North-South economic divide and clearly sympathizes with the unfortunate and disenfranchised. The central character, Paul Safranek, played with good-natured befuddlement by Matt Damon, goes on a classic journey of self discovery and ethical change. Initially, he seems a little shallow and materialistic, and very dissatisfied with his life. Kristen Wiig plays her classic nervous and excitable wife, Audrey. Initially, they are a couple who decide to undertake a newly-invented procedure to shrink their bodies so they can start a new life in an experimental community called Leisure World. Her decision to back out at the last second and leave Paul leaves him emotionally devastated and totally up-ends his plans to live in luxury in his new shrunken city. The first part of Downsizing is Paul's reaction and adjustment to grieving about his marriage. The second part is Paul rediscovering himself after meeting Ngoc Lan, a Vietnamese activist who was shrunk against her will by her government and smuggled into America. Ngoc Lan introduces Paul to the seedy underbelly of the miniature world he has joined, complete with its own day labor class, illegal immigrants, and scarcity issues. At times, the allegory is a little thick-- understandably. this is a message movie about the impact of rampant consumerism and waste on the environment. Still, it makes for a very compelling movie, with an interesting denouement, complete with the end of the world. Pretty cosmic stuff. What Downsizing isn't, really, is a film about the wacky adventures of a man who miniaturizes himself and has to adjust to being little in a big world. The entire movie could have jettisoned the miniature angle and still be a very watchable and entertaining story. The miniaturizing part is really there to provide a plot device to bring the characters together. I should have expected this from Alexander Payne, whose previous movies share a lighthearted approach to serious subjects. I enjoyed this one, and will watch it again.
Can you say “little people?” Should have been about the Germans.
When I first started watching this I was like why is everyone shitting on this it’s not that bad. And then an hour passed. While the concept is interesting, the actual story they chose to focus on was so boring. Scenes draggeddddddd on.  I did see the message to not forget about those in need even if they don’t have a chance in the future. But that was after thinking about it for a minute. And finally the best part was seeing thee gorgeous Christoph Waltz across my screen.
this took on a more environmental stance than i was expecting and i appreciated that but like, i don't even know what this was about really
I was hesitant to watch this because of all the bad reviews, but Downsizing is excellent. I should’ve never doubted Alexander Payne. I love all his other films, and this is very much an Alexander Payne film—the atmosphere, humor, everything is in his signature dry wit. It’s an excellent movie with a great message, and I can’t wait for his next one.
After a year of hearing how disappointing this movie was, I did not expect much. And I was still disappointed. Great idea, terrible execution. Too much time was spent on scenes that matter little, and scenes that have a lot of heart, or very interesting or funny, are cut off way too soon.
After the first 30 minutes the film itself downsizes on its own primes.
What a strange movie. I had no idea what I was getting into with this one. More plot twists than an episode of Family Guy.  Made me feel a bit sad throughout.
This is a mess. A cool concept but really poorly executed.
A great concept for a movie, but a strange delivery. It's never particularly funny, never particularly biting, engaging, offensive, or exciting. It just sort of plods along from one new plot thread to the next.
Has the same uneasy vibe as The Leftovers and The Lobster but sucks instead of rips. At some point it just stops being about anything.  It has Laura Dern for a minute there though
but why did they have to drag Christoph Waltz into this
A movie so desperately racist, it kinda makes you feel happy for a climate change inflicted end of the world because it’s clearly what white people deserve.
i thought it was a comedy :sadcowboy:
It had a lot of problems. But it wasn't a disaster. It had a lot to say about class, the environment, and what it really means to be "a humanitarian". The trailers and the premise led you to think it was a goofy comedy, and maybe those expectations led to a lot of its bad reviews. In time, perhaps it will get re-evaluated by the critical consensus. Also that village in Norway is kinda where I want to live in real life. But what the hell do they do in winter!?
Great creative idea but somehow doesn’t come together
This film is absolutely a case of false advertising. What trailers seemed to indicate is far different than the film itself but regardless of that and going off the film as it stands on it's own, this feels so aimless. Not sure what it's trying to be in which direction until shuffling for a sense of meaning near the end. I guess you could say, this one came up short.
Not as bad as I expected, but not quite good either. I still enjoyed the film, and I loved Hong Chau in it.
Ultimately middling and forgettable (I forgot to log it yesterday along with the rest of my weekend viewing), Downsizing is ambitious while struggling to focus on any particular message. It's a movie about personal growth under the guise of being about climate change and the destructive nature of man, yet it never fully sells you on the journey of its main character. Matt Damon's character is supposed to be a stand in for all of us, but all of our problems aren't the same and certainly nothing like his. Framing it around the ridiculous, outlandish concept of the movie doesn't really help in that regard. I wish Downsizing were a big more absurd and a little less saccharin. I wish it had more of Hong Chau and spent more time with Kristen Wiig's character to justify her actions. Downsizing leaves you wanting more in the bad way. But it's still entertaining, an easy watch on Netflix if you've waited this long.
Alexander Payne's films insist upon themselves. They insist upon themselves. 2 1/2 stars for Hong Chau.
This film should of had a marquee with the headline ⭐️ Starring Hong Chau ⭐️  She delivered a spirited performance that gave me all the feels. Christopher Waltz and Udo Kier were like a modern day Statler and Waldorf, which was a playful addition to this cast. I love Alexander Payne movies but not my favorite.   Still not a fan of Matt Damon 🤷🏻‍♀️
Downsizing's ambitions are overshadowed by its own disinterest in fully exploring each fascinating "world-making" element it creates. A smart comedy and satire, which may have proven more digestible to audiences as a series, instead takes on the appearance of Honey I Shrunk the Kids without the adventure. Payne's dry and corny humor just doesn't seem to provide the colors to successfully paint a picture I would expect a lot of people want to see. Still there's a lot to enjoy here and I could see this receiving the same soft revaluation a comedy like Idiocracy is now having...once enough time passes.
Did they have to shave the dogs when they shrink them wtf
i’m upset this is as bad as it is. man, i deserved more. hong chau is the only saving grace.
this movie downsized in how interesting it was as it went on
Basically Honey, We Shrunk Ourselves but not fun
Well, that was deeply odd. Of interest.
Interesting concept, almost too close to reality. A bit difficult to follow though, mostly financially.
I...wanted to like this film. And I did, a 3/5 bit. The film initially delicately and meticulously handles the premise until it implodes into an environmental and existential commentary accompanied by some strange character arcs. The film loses its footing and seems to stumble over some unnecessary obstacles. Even as it descends into a mess, the film asks important questions which seem to be simply diluted towards the film's end.
Sorry for doubting you climate change, you were right. This dull ass movie proves that human beings should be wiped from the surface of the earth.
»When you know death comes soon, you look around things more close.« This movie did pretty well in the first half in my opinion, but after that I felt like the plot isn't going anywhere. I wish they would have shown more of the life of small people or the differences between small and normal people. I kept forgetting that they aren't normal size anymore, because everything is filmed in the perspective of the small people...
Downsizing is a perfect example of a movie that generally introduces a neat concept as well as providing a stellar cast making the characters relatable and genuine but the story falls short on almost all aspects. The first act of the entire film is the strongest element of the film as it explores the concept of a world where people are downsized in an effort to thwart humanity’s potential doomsday. Matt Damon plays a compelling protagonist as he has to adjust to the life changes of being downsized especially after it changes his life for the worse rather then the better. The film is a flop as it isn’t able to capitilize in its neat concept and instead focuses on a love/drama story of a man adjusting to a new way of life. The film could have gone in so many directions but falls on a flat note for its inability to use the concept it has presented to make a compelling genuine story. We are left to watch a typical movie that has been explored in so many other films. Overall rating 2.5/5 great concept and character performances but stale, uninteresting plot.
Maybe it was lowered expectations going in, but I surprisingly maybe liked this? However, I really hope that someday Payne will make a movie not centered around a white dude. It could have been so easy here to just swap roles and make Wiig the protagonist.
Goes downhill after a promising start but I've got a soft spot for tonally uneven films and this is all over the place. An interesting failure.
I... didn't hate it. The concept is fun even if the tone and plot is all over the place. It had good moments (primarily in the beginning) Do I thinkit would've been better with Rick Moranis in it? YES!!!!
Ah, Dowson grew up & is in a film. When they first entered the lobby "I'm in Heaven" was playing. I couldn't help but to smile. NPH was everything as the welcoming host who claimed to be an "average man". NPH is anything but average so why was he in this film? I was surprised small person rights were brought up so early in the film. Seeds planted-I get it yet nothing was brought up again... I was pleasantly surprised by the diversity it the processing room for Downsizing. Pre-Norway speech was so way over the top. Where did that come from? Beeep. Bloop. Such a small rock drop. It was hilarious and not disappointing as I expected it be just that.
the movie was pretty enjoyable & touching at a point but i forgot they were shrunken humans, the main purpose, for like half the movie the concept was good but executed so poorly
2 stars only for Christoph Waltz and Kristen Wiig
I understand the criticisms of this movie... They could have done something a lot more fun with a premise like this... But instead they went for a solemn meditation on class, race, humanity, and love, which I have to respect. The CGI is dodgy, and I wish they'd made the movie with practical effects, but I understand why they just went for it. I really dug the melancholy sadness of this, idk... Maybe its theme of big societal change promising a utopic, prosperous future that never materializes really resonated with me, a member of a generation raised amid... Exactly that. All the future opportunities for Hong Chau though, please!!
If you remember Superman II, the great hero loses his powers and we see him as a mere mortal. The same thing happened to Alexander Payne in 2017. A writer-director at the top of his game for years and years now, one of very few who can blend drama with comedy in such a life-life way. With Downsizing, the comedy and drama are quickly muddled, and there is, among other problems, no return in sight. Downsizing drifts off into a dark social climate that just does not engage.

This was good for like half an hour
not at all like the commercials, very serious
Viewed on Netflix All while keeping at a level of a slight notch above boredom, Alexander Payne's Downsizing (2017) is a roller coaster ride of a film. I went from enjoying it, to NOT enjoying it, to enjoying it again and finally NOT enjoying it again...and then the film ends. If you've seen any of the trailers... THEY ARE LYING TO YOU. This is easily Alexander Payne's worst film.
High concept that maybe could’ve benefited from... downsizing... on a few of its lofty ambitions.
Uh I’m tired of watching movies that have no plot until the last 10 minutes...
Wowwwww what a weird turkey. I wanted to see this even though everything I’ve heard about it has been very negative.  The first 45min was so good I was like “everybody’s an idiot, this is great!”  Then the movie keeps going and gets so weird and bad it’s almost unbelievable. This is a great concept for a movie and I wish they made a good version instead of whatever the hell this is.
Get this thing away from me
I need a word for "I felt like watching a movie but am lacking mental energy and generally not feeling great so I'm going to watch a movie that looks really dumb and I didn't think I'd ever watch but there is something about it that kind of intrigues me so I'll roll the dice," because I felt like watching a movie but was lacking mental energy and generally not feeling great so I picked a movie that looked really dumb and I didn't think I'd ever watch but there was something about it that kind of intrigued me so I rolled the dice.  This went from "this might not be as bad as it looked" to "whoa what happened none of this was in the trailer is this good?" to "wait no what the hell does this have to do with anything?"  Hong Chau gave this film most of its life. I also thought she was great in a small role in Amazon's series Homecoming, but otherwise am unfamiliar with her work.
It starts out making you think about shrinking your body for profit and for saving the planet. Not a bad sci-fi start. And along the way it raises some interesting questions about the end of humanity. But there are long stretches where it makes no sense at all.
was this a fever dream bc it cannot have been real
This movie started off with promise but ultimately fell flat. However there were things I liked about. Mostly Hong Chau. She was fantastic. Please cast her in more things. The honesty of her performance makes it worth the watch.
A placid normal guy who is used to monotony and is thrown some bad cards is the lead of this film. Interesting concept with a relatable perspective. I feel that the potential of this movie overall ends up fizzling for the most part as the direction you anticipate things going is continuously thrown out the window. As a film for the masses, I can envision most people disliking the dry comedy and uneven flow of this film, but I adore the concept, acting, and message that this film leaves. Get out in new, uncomfortable situations and see where life brings you and what you can bring on yourself. You never know.
what was the POINT    blu ray
if i can use one word to describe this movie i’d choose the word MEH
The best thing about the movie is also its most problematic.
An absolute trainwreck. But if you want to make great films you got to take a risk some times. I'm looking forward to Paynes next project. Let's leave it at that.
Where did all the small stuff get made... like the Furniture, cars, bikes? Why were raindrops not huge? Has Alexander Payne even seen ‘Honey I Shrunk The Kids’?!
Interesting, but it was diluted by trying to make too many statements. The point best-made was that people would downsize — shrink themselves — to permit them to live in “McMansions” and general excess.
An interesting idea that focuses less on the political, social, and economic affects the idea would have on the world for a story with less impact and keeping us (disappointingly) uninterested.
I almost passed on this one because of the reviews.  There is always the risk that bad science fiction can be really bad.  However, I am an easy sell on SciFi if you just go all in on the insanity and don’t try to make jokes around the already obviously ridiculous premise.  The comedy comes from the offbeat concept and characters that are pretty enjoyable to watch.
I'm very conflicted over this film. See, the only reason I'd want to save the world is I like my stuff and want to keep it around but if the solution to the worlds ills involves me leaving my stuff behind....?
The original idea wasn’t bad, hovewer, it could have been managed and explored differently to make it look interesting. Hong Chau's/Ngoc Lan Tran was the best thing of the movie tho, what a character !!!
I was digging through this with joy until the story's second act hits, Matt Damon gets drunk at a party and somehow the script jumps off the top of a pint-size building. What followed was an epic fight between me and the fast forward button.
matt damons character - boring plot - nonexistent? matt damon gets small and that's all that really matters direction - the safest possible execution why was this made
matt damon really shrank himself to 5 inches just to warn us about climate change and y’all still ain’t listening huh  also... comedy? ... i guess u can pop in one racial caricature and call it day...
I wasn't aware this movie had such mixed reviews, but I sorta understand why. I went in mostly blind (having not seen the trailer) and mostly enjoyed it.
Downhill
Ngoc Lan Tran is the highlight of this movie. I would watch this again solely for the purpose of getting my stomach tickled by her funny dialogues.
I give it credit for the fun special effects and the actors had a lot of fun. Otherwise, most of the movie just loved itself a little too long. And I believe my heartstrings could have been played more, so I was disappointed.
definition of meh
A movie that should only be watched on the plane when you have no better options.
There is a whole lot of things that you explore while you watch this movie, if you watch it sincerely. Matt Donavan has proved himself again on how good he tries to put the viewers in his place through his acting skills. Watching his emotions and reactions made me feel like I was reading what was going on in his mind. I presumed the movie to be of some kind before watching it and while I watched it move through all the bends and curves through its journey i realized how beautiful it is than what i imagined. The Sci-Fi movie which linked the techno advancement to the great global cause. Whenever you find yourself curiously moving along with the movie, Christoph Waltz(Dusan Mirkovic) will help you relive the tension on your forehead and put a smile on your face. There was this part which hit me hard while watching this film, global warming is a serious threat, you know what else is? The wonderfully designed, provided with great power and the freedom to choose and resolve actions may end up in nothing but vain, which of course what we humans brought on ourselves. However debating over this is whole other topic, but this movie will put you on some different perspective. Maybe I spoke a little out of the picture above but, hey, you asked for my review and this what i really felt and thought watching the movie. Yet I'm glad and enjoyed watching this movie.
I’m just glad to see Udo Kier is getting more work. I wanted to step on lil Matt Damon.
7.7/10, There's a few guys or girls that put together multiple trailers for this movie back in 2017. One trailer really got me pumped up and I was blown away by. I was the definition of sold by not only the concept but by the trailer. It was my most anticipated movie of 2017 and we had a Plant Hulk movie coming out. PLANT HULK! Then as I sat in a dimly lit theatre one evening the 2nd trailer appeared on the screen. I was in horror while watching this trailer. Never has there ever been a trailer (other than cast away) that spoiled so much of the film. I couldn't believe what I saw but it was right there infront of me. I decided not to see the movie based on that trailer. I knew how the film progressed and was really looking forward to seeing it play out as I actually watched the movie. I finally saw it today and it was really good! The potential for this to be an 8 or a 9 was there but disappointingly it was completely let go by the fucktards at Universals trailer cutting company. A year later and I'm still extremely extremely extremely disappointed in the cut of this trailer. Anyway, it's a fun movie that makes you think. Check it out.
I know most people didn't like this one and I expected a comedy too but when the film went a completely different direction I thought "This is much better". I felt that "Downsizing" is a warm-hearted movie with very likable characters in it especially Hong Chau as a Vietnamese dissident, who stole the show. I really enjoyed watching this a second time which I do very rarely.
This movie was all over the place, and not in a good way.
This movie was so forgettable that Moviepass doesn’t even have a poster for it on file anymore.
trailer: whimsical rom-com about a small man trying to find love in a new world uwu, hijinks ensue movie: commentary on human rights, capitalism, global warming????? and racist caricature???
The film opens with an astonishing scientific breakthrough when Swedish scientists discover how to shrink any living organism. Humans shrunk to such a size would massively reduce their impact on the environment. A few years later and the trend to 'Downsize' has become a phenomena as investing all full size worth into tiny resources means you can live a leisurely lifestyle. Married couple Paul and Audrey (Matt Damon and Kristen Wiig) elect to do this and set out for 'Leisureworld'. Upon arrival however things start to unravel for Paul and he ends up alone working another dead end job. His exuberant neighbour Dusan (Christoph Waltz) starts showing him another aspect of the world and he also meets Ngoc (Hong Chau) a Vietnamese woman who's approach to life is very different from his own. This film - a dark comedy - is something of a mess with lots of fascinating ideas - some of which are just left hanging without being explored - and characters ranging from the fascinating (Ngoc) to the wasted (Audrey). Viewers going in expecting a traditional sci-fi movie may be disappointed as the film meanders into reflections on the nature of existence and the quality of life versus quality of lifestyle. Director Alexander Payne seems unsure how to explore many of the issues he raises - leaving things open for debate is fine - but the debate needs to at least begin within the film. Audrey's character does something seemingly from out of left field and we never get to truly understand why. The biggest issue though is Matt Damon. Hopelessly miscast his selfless doormat is so out of character you keep waiting for him to react. A more comic actor could have mined the misfortunes that befall Paul for more laughs - with Damon we just cringe for him. So - interesting ideas go unexplored and half as funny as it should be.
Fun exploration of a concept, but that's also all it is.
I thought this was supposed to be about little people
what the fuck first half was so good but it just fell apart on the second half
they should have downsized the run time and focused in on a storyline cause wtf.
Alexander Payne's unfairly maligned Downsizing has the rare storyline that you could almost have a more satisfying time listening to someone describe than actually seeing executed. This has always been the filmmaker Payne has been. His most cohesive films have everything in common with this heady, meandering and benign film. It would have been a savory novel were it not for the lovely visual gimmick of how people re-imagine space and civilization at five inches tall. And Downsizing elevates its gimmick: Even if we scoff and laugh at it, we realize that the way things are going, it's no crazier an idea than anything else we could desperately concoct in an attempt to escape our irreversible environmental fate. The social make-up fo the world as microcosm is certainly intriguing, a dollhouse of all the world's indulgences and hardships in one Russian doll. While Downsizing is not without concern for the end of human life on earth, it faces the threat with little gravitas, and instead meditates wryly on what “the good life” may comprise, here and now. A change of perspective helps one to better grasp the world, and Downsizing makes it as straightforward as an allegory can be without losing its luster in the first act.
It's not awful. It's pleasantly whimsical to a point.
Hong Chau is a revelation in Alexander Payne’s thought-provoking and original "Downsizing."
2 Stars Best Performance: Matt Damon Scene Stealer: Christoph Waltz Score: 5/10 Worth Seeing in Theaters? No Rewatch Factor: 2/10 Additional Notes: It's a very interesting premise, but the movie takes sharp turns and leaves you wondering what just happened.
Downsizing, director Alexander Payne’s latest film, is an interesting beast in a strong body of work. Set in a near future, the narrative utilises the lofty concept of “downsizing”: the irreversible process of shrinking humans down to approximately five inches tall as means of combating overpopulation. Opening in a world where both normal and “downsized” people coexist, the film follows strapped-for-cash occupational therapist Paul Safranek (Matt Damon) who lives with his wife, Audrey (Kristen Wiig). They ponder the procedure after meeting a friend at a reunion party, who reveals other benefits – financial security, for one. To reveal any more would be a disservice to the film as this is what is sold in the marketing. However, Downsizing has a lot hidden up its sleeve, perhaps accounting for the film’s decidedly mixed reception. It’s actually a lot better than the reviews would suggest, and is a marvel in world-building. The settings that Payne creates are frequently awe-inspiring and the minutiae admirable, greatly elevating the verisimilitude of the film. That said, a tonal shift midway through does feel like a switch-and-bait. There is still enjoyment to be had in the slightly more familiar, “finding oneself ” narrative route Payne explores, even though its moral messages are delivered heavy-handedly. Downsizing balances comedy and emotion well, and is bolstered by being both thematically rich and chock-full of metaphors, right down to the very concept of the film itself, interrogating political and planetary notions. The performances are sound, the highlights being those of being Christoph Waltz and Udo Kier. To see both German-speaking stalwarts share the screen is very satisfying. Downsizing is a commendable effort by Alexander Payne, with transfixing worldbuilding, but it requires one to have faith in the tonal shift in its second half. The first half is much stronger, but the direction it takes thereafter is probably why many have taken quite sourly to the film: you don’t exactly get what the trailers promised.

So I stopped watching this with about an hour left just because it was so bad. It just seemed to go on forever. The whole shrinking concept was all right and made the first half hour or so decent but then after about 45 minutes it seems they just forgot about the whole concept and just changed the whole movie into a boring movie in which nothing really happened.  Don’t waste your time watching this rubbish.
Alexander Payne, a humanistic filmmaker, is clearly interested in getting "ordinary folk" on camera. Hence the main part of Leisureland being populated by movie stars like Laura Dern and Neil Patrick Harris, and the outskirts being populated by unknown performers and non-actors.
The idea is vert sick! The beginning is good. But what is happening at the end of the movie? I’m soo confused..
interesting idea, mediocre film with a couple of slightly intriguing situations and (cheap) laughs.
Small Matt Damon made me want to throw up
What’s baffling is that the scientist who discovered downsizing used powerpoint-default font Calibri for his big announcement. Weird movie but with a good heart. I think Hong Chau nailed the very hard Vietnamese accent. The trailers ruined this since it kinda sold the movie as a social satire but it’s mostly not. Not what we’re expecting anyway especially after that turn to the beginning of the apocalypse.
If you wanna help the earth, ya better start with your neighbors. Every man for themselves, sure, but.. there’s no harm in giving the old homeless man some chicken once in a while.. ya know?
went from interesting to whats the point to sooo boring, if you are gonna make a point to this movie about environmental change, stick to it and make it clear instead of changing scenarios so fast
50 I am not sure what to make of this movie. I really didn't see the point in the plot at times. This had some good moments, but overall was disappointing considering it had potential to be much better.
The beginning was good for like 20 minutes?
Still uncapable to decide if I liked Downsizing and the idea that stands behind its realization or not. I watched it mainly because there was Christoph Waltz, but his role is not that central. Probably the main character was so weak that you are not interested in what happens to him, so you are not interested in what happens in general to the film. Even when people are preparing for saving the human race by undertaking an 8.000 year trip under a mountain, you don't get to think: "wow, how cool is that". No, and that's really a major issue. So well, probably I didn't like the movie, and maybe not even the idea that stands behind it.
Maybe I overhyped it in my head but this film just felt small.
I was just thinking about it and like Fuck downsizing! I wanted Honey I Shrunk the Matt Damon but what I got was a bad environmental film that's as heavy handed as a real hand in comparison to a small person. Which is to say very heavy. it Alexander Pains me to say this but it's a mess don't do it
Well, there is an asian woman who speaks broken englisch. VERY FUNNY.
I really enjoyed this movie 😊
A subtle mix of props and FX sell the visuals, a meticulous prologue sells the concept, and a midlife crisis plot divided the audience. Very much an Alexander Payne film.
very thought provoking.
Downsizing does a very good job at establishing its premise but once Damon's character is shrunk in size, it has no idea what to do with itself. Any statements about the fragility of humility are undercut by an aggressively annoying supporting cast.
The reason they became small is for a scientific and logistic purposeful reason and I was kinda dissapointed they aren't any fun Honey I Shrunk the Kids moments and they barely toy with the gimmick. me and my friends tried to sneak in to watch another movie for free after watching a movie in cinemas (Along With The Gods) cause the damn ticket was expensive and we were pissed off and we want our money worth and the plan was to wait in the toilet for a bit and just go to a movie hall so we tried that and the first hall is Maze Runner:Death Cure and we decided that it sucked so we went to another hall that showed Downsinzing.it was settled me and my bud would sit at the back and my 3rd friend would sit in the empty row in the front. So we got in,sat down,one of my buds ran down the stairs to the front and immediatly the guy sitting in front immediatly noticed us with a weird look on his face. I was nervous that we might got caught but then I saw my buddy that was supposed to be at the front ran up the hall stairs and I looked back at the screen and the credits rolled. we panicked and got the hell outta there.Good experience. So the only the only thing I knew before I watched the movie was the trailer,A couple of mean spirited reviews youtube comments and the last 30 sec of the ending and gotta say the trailer made it look exciting but it is not,the youtube comment reviews were stupid and the ending stinks cause like it is just too sudden. if this story is retold in a simpler way even without the shrinking gimmick its still a good story. I'm hugely dissapointed that they wasted Kristenn Wigg like that like c'mon Kristen make Hollywood make you a fuckin movie that will immortalise you already that being said though Ngoc Lan is a standout,she is a really is a great strong interisting character.
No.  The whole Downsizing thing is a great idea but the story they told ruined it.
Downsizing – 3.5/10 I have never seen a movie fall off a cliff this badly. After a very promising first hour it completely nose dived and quickly became irritating. After all of the detail they put into building the world, it’s baffling that they didn’t follow up on any of it. There is a great scene in a bar where a ‘regular’ sized person starts spewing abuse at the ‘downsizers’ as they no longer contribute top the economy. That’s your movie right there. Focus on that dynamic and make it a satire. Instead they introduce one of the most misjudged characters of the year; the Vietnamese cleaning lady. Hong Chau is a golden globe nominate actor, but I found her character shrill, slightly racist and more annoying than Jar-Jar Binx. The fact that she becomes Matt Damon’s love interest just doesn’t sit right at all. This is a squandered opportunity at exploring a relevant and interesting topic. It’s off-beat quirkiness just comes across as try-hard and unfunny.
The film starts interesting into building a world of the downsized people. It's fun to see how they interact with the normal world and how they fit in it. The actor are also doing a pretty good job. Matt Damon and Hong Chau work great together and are fun to watch. So it is even sader that the story around Matt Damons character is a bit lame. In the last thrid of the film in the Norway the film is just plain boring. I had no emotional attachment to the the norwegian Community. I didn't care about anything about the whole save bunker and coming up mankind catastrophe. "Downsizing" would have much more better if Alexander Payne just focused more on the effects of the Downsizing to the world. Impacts in the politics, the eccomomy and the society are mostly teased here. The focus should have been definitly here.
In terms of quality, Alexander Payne has been downsizing since his early film - Election, a wonderfully witty dissection of intra-school politics and relationships, which worked perfectly as a wider metaphor for power dynamics in general. Since then, his films have become increasingly less convincing, none more so than Downsizing. The idea was a clever one and rich with comic potential and satirical opportunities. Few are realised. Thank god, for Christoph Waltz, the best thing in the film by a proverbial mile. And as for Damon's relationship with a one-legged cleaner, who dreamed that idea up? It was ludicrous in the extreme. It didn't help that the mono-ped was so unbearably annoying, I had nightmarish visions of ripping off her wooden leg and beating her over the head with it. In the end, Downsizing was like its protagonist, well-meaning but fairly dull.
A bit stretched out, some interesting plot points skipped, but quite sweet? An easy Sunday watch
Before I had ever seen the likes of Disney fantasy films such as Alice in Wonderland or Peter Pan, there was Labyrinth. One scene, in particular, would lay claim over my earliest childhood memory and stay buried in the recesses of my mind resting as a dormant dream waiting to be reawakened. Of course, I'm talking about the visually captivating, mind-warping staircase scene followed by the scene where Sarah confronts Jareth (ala Nancy in Nightmare on Elm Street). My first glimpse into fantasy was that of an ebony-haired, princess-like girl running through a three-dimensional geometric puzzle trying to save her baby brother in red-striped pajamas as the villain chases her while defying the laws of gravity. Imagine that being your first memory at two years old. The details, the shapes, the colors, the textures, the geometry. It was a complex vision that would haunt and enchant my thoughts for many years as I wouldn't learn of Labyrinth's existence for a very long time. Over the years, I would relive that memory, being in that old room, seeing that specific scene on the television as I wondered where on earth it came from. Over time, I surrendered to the reality I would never see that magical scene again as I never found the TV show or movie it came from. Which is why when I saw it again eight years ago on Netflix I was filled with euphoria. It was like magic to relive that one scene again, and to finally experience the story this scene took place in. That one scene is where my nostalgia stems from when it comes to this movie even though the most amount of time I viewed this as a child was probably five minutes. It's a remarkable scene I will always marvel at and my favorite scene of the movie. It's one of the few standout scenes from an otherwise lackluster fantasy film. Frankly, I never cared for Jim Henson productions; not even as a child. They bored me. The puppets are way too over-the-top. This production in particular also suffers from clunky dialog and a desire to make an Alice in Wonderland / Wizard of Oz episodic fantasy escapism film without any satisfying logic or memorable characters. The movie plays like a surreal dream disregarding spatial dimensions at times so Sarah can conveniently reach Goblin City before her time expires. Time doesn't even seem to matter in the end, since it's revealed Jareth can control the amount of time Sarah has left to save her brother. The rules are just unclear on that. There are many things about this movie that befuddle me. Why Jennifer Connelly is an overdramatic brat in one instance, and in the next completely reactionless when placed into mortal danger, and sometimes just walking cluelessly around with no real sense of urgency or agency. Her main problem is not knowing how normal humans would react in her given circumstances. Whether it was how the character was written, the direction, the skill of actress Connelly, or all of the above remains a mystery to me, but you know what, it sort of works overall for this particular story. Nothing really makes sense, maybe because most of it seems to be aimed at children. Where Labyrinth exceeds in quality is atmosphere. If you don't think too much on plot, dialog, character growth and dynamics, you can still be mesmerized with impressive sets and standout visual sequences. Oh, and David Bowie's wonderful music. Here are my favorite stand out scenes that call to the magic of a moment: -Opening in the park where Sarah practices her lines -Dance Magic Dance musical scene -Sarah's entrance into the Labyrinth -The masquerade musical scene -The warped staircase musical scene Essentially, when you throw puppets in, I become disinterested. The 'climactic' battle in Goblin City was a chore to get through. It's visually uninteresting and bloats the runtime; complete opposite of the staircase sequence (which is like something out of Inception). It's visually arresting and deserving of run time.
The most wholesome and fun movie
a fantasy coming-of-age classic that I didn’t watch until now, probably because I wasn’t even born when this movie was a thing. I enjoyed every part of it. It brings me strong childhood memories when all I did on my weekends was watching movies like the neverending story, E.T. & gremlins. oh dear, i wish i could go back to those times.  thank you for this movie, jim henson.
its interesting what the ravishes of time do to you.... beside all the usual things, I had no idea this was a db song and dance vehicle I just remember it as jc running around petulantly with some moldy muppets unfortunately this rendition was slightly marred by having a call to nip into work, just as they were approaching the end game, so I had to pick it up again several hours later which might explain why I thought the ending was a bit of a cop out only enduring moment was miss connelly forgetting her lines on the lawn I always imagine 'baby' is duncan jones also hogwart - that sounds familiar
If David Lynch put a kids film together it definitely would have turned out like this.
all hail the goblin king
I’ve got a double shift tomorrow and I needed this.
The only thing I loved about the movie is Bowie's necklace. I really want it!😍 As far as the movie, the lyric "love injection" says it all. It's like Motley Crue meets The Wizard of Oz, at the quality level of The Room.
Nothing could spoil my love of Jim Henson's work. But do you think that when the producers heard Bowie's stagnant songs that had nothing to do with the story or tone of the film, they were like "go on, you say something..."
Labyrinth is a movie in which a girl hates crying children so much that she willingly gives her baby brother to goblins. I can relate. But then, although she is bratty and self-important, Sarah (a teenaged Jennifer Connelly) has a pang of conscience when Jareth the Goblin King (David Bowie, whose costume and performance can only be explained by the fact that he is David Bowie) shows up and actually takes the child. Arbitrarily, he decides she has 13 hours to solve his labyrinth and rescue her brother. Defined by her strong will, Sarah determines to do it, and embarks on the quest to overcome a series of obstacles as she makes friends and enemies in the muppet-y goblin world. Oh yeah and there's a goblin world that I guess Sarah knows about because she read it in a book or something or it's possible the whole thing is just a story she makes up or dreams up while her parents go out and leave her to babysit. Directed by Jim Henson but written by Python's Terry Jones, the movie Labyrinth most reminded me of was Time Bandits; though it lacks Gilliam's signature visuals and the droll humor the Python crew brought to that film. Despite what the title would suggest, the film is a straightforward narrative in which Sarah encounters one challenge after another, which she solves with minimal effort, a ton of luck, and the help of some prickly puppets who fortunately for Sarah are at least as ill-mannered as she is. I like the adventurous vibe of the movie and most of the sets and puppets work pretty well. The green-screen stuff not so much. I'm actually a fan of the episodic nature of stories like this and I found that a few of the traps put out to ensnare Sarah and prevent her from completing her quest were thematically strong, like the old peddler who tries to make her complacent by loading her down with toys and knick knacks. Somehow, though, even as simple as the story is, it lacks a strong through-line and the comic action sequences are silly without being funny and the songs are just bewildering. Some of the characters, like Didymus, are really annoying. Brian Henson's voice work as Hoggle irked me too for some reason. I can certainly see how this might be a special movie to someone, particularly if that someone was a young girl when they first saw it. It's a movie aimed at children. As an adult man I can appreciate some of the creative bits but it mostly makes me scratch my head and ask things like is it a musical or not? Does Sarah learn anything from the experience? Why is the Goblin King the only human in Goblin world? And why do Sarah's parents want her to go on dates when she's clearly about 15? It's hard to put into words my lack of enthusiasm for this. I like weirdness but I like it bold and purposeful and a lot of this feels kind of random and meaningless. But Jareth would make a rad Halloween costume.
Never thought I'd say this, but this is too much Jim Henson and Terry Jones for me. The whole movie is just a bit much.
To summarise; Creepy goblins  Cheesy 80s guitar  Hoggle  David Bowie throwing babies around  Young Jennifer connelly  Hoggle  A maze Creepy David Bowie being creepy  Hoggle  David Bowie’s bulge
David Bowie: -tossing around a baby like it’s a ball  -singing magic dance with puppets -having a bulge in a kids movie -being in love with a 16 year old girl in a very weird and creepy way -doing that swishy thing with the ball and his hands  Is what makes this movie really good even now.
will forever be my favorite movie of all time. long live the goblin king.
I probably would have enjoyed this a lot more if I first saw this as a kid. And Jim Henson’s imagination is definitely on display. But this movie is definitely a product of the 80s that’s definitely dated in some ways, as well. Also, Jennifer Connelly’s character is a little TOO angsty for my taste.
sucks that i've said "someone take me away from this awful place" many times and yet i've never been whisked away into the goblin realm by david bowie. seems unfair
The puppeteering is great. The trick photography is sublime. I can't wait to scare the shit out of my unborn children with this.
Wears its heart on its sleeve, great scope villain & stakes, awesome production design + music, 'real life' bit cringey, fun!
I’m sure this was great in its day, but This one does not hold up the test of time. The plot is a bit troubling.
This was so weirdly sexual, why does he keep singing at her about how he wants to be her slave when she wants this baby? Why does he want the baby so bad
what a trip.
You remind me of the babe What babe? The babe with the power What power? Power of the voodoo Who do? You do Do what? You remind me of the babe
came here after just THINKING about the as the world falls down scene…… there are no words to describe how much i love that and david bowie and jennifer connelly in this film in general
A wonderful tale! The story is super creative and the characters are very well developped and endearing. The puppets are perfectly done and look realistic. Unfortunately, all the green screen scenes are getting old with time. But is is still super impressive for a 1986's movie.
Back when I was five years old, in class on a Friday afternoon, the teacher thought, "hey, wouldn't it be fun to show the kids The Dark Crystal?" All the kids were scared shitless. Baaaad idea. Luckily, it came as a double DVD with another Jim Henson classic - Labyrinth. Back then, I thought the film was a great chance to pass the time away. I don't remember an awful lot about my first viewing of Labyrinth, and for the next ten years, I just forgot about it. When I was fourteen, I started going through a Bowie phase (well, I wouldn't call it a phase because i'm still in that phase right now). This was 2015, my art teacher (who also runs a prog rock radio program) gave me a USB disk full of literally every rock album known to man. Without that USB, I would have never heard the White Album, Highway 61 Revisited, Tubular Bells, or In The Court Of The Crimson King - all magnificent albums. But in that collection, he gave me every Bowie album, a gift which I am eternally grateful for, especially since about three months later he was fired for smoking in class. Bloody legend. Anyway, David Bowie meant a lot to me. He probably means a lot to some of you as well. So when his death came around in 2016, I relistened to that whole catalogue, and then I came across the soundtrack for Labyrinth. Sweet mother of god, was he in that? Yes. Yes he was. So, I made myself a promise to sit down and watch Labyrinth, a promise that I admit took me two more years to fulfil. There's just so much that needs to be said about it. Jim Henson, Terry Jones and David Bowie all working on this one project seems like something many would wish for if it didn't exist. Jennifer Connelly was amazing as Sarah, that's definitely worth a mention, but unfortunately a lot more of this review's going to be me gushing on about the Goblin King. How the fuck someone can possibly get away with an outfit like the Goblin King's is absurd. Like, in a KIDS FILM, there you have it. David Bowie's crotch barely hiding from full view. (I have a feeling that when in "Ziggy Stardust" he sung "Well hung with a snow white tan" he was just meaning himself...) Putting aside that, his performance is perfect. Like, there's many unforgettable villains in cinema. Darth Vader. Anton Chigurh. Biff Tannen. But never would I ever expect the Goblin King to top my list like that. He exceeded my expectations. There's also something great about the way he says "baby". I don't know what.
The music, the visuals...I freaking love this movie.
Just watched this for the first time. Dang
It's weird that this felt so much like Dark Souls: The Movie to me.
It's cute and stuff, but awkward. I have very little comment about the plot because it simply wasn't aimed at me, but the practical effects are really, really cool. The CGI effects, however, are really, really funny.
Oddly charming dark fantasy movie. Puppets plus for sure. Bowie yeah. 🧙‍♂️ haven't seen this since I was like 5.
i want my 5 yo cousin to be ludo for halloween bc she now loves him and would kill it
This film played a big part in my developmental stage of life
One of my all time favorites. In my opinion David Bowie killed it as the goblin king. Love all of the puppets created by Jim Henson. Great movie would recommend this to anyone no matter how they are feeling. " Once upon a time, there was a beautiful young girl whose stepmother always made her stay home with the baby. And the baby was a spoiled child, and wanted everything to himself, and the young girl was practically a slave. But what no one knew is that the king of the goblins had fallen in love with the the girl, and he had given her certain powers. So one night, when the baby had be particularly cruel to her, she called on the goblins for help!" - Sarah Amaris
Bowie shagged a minor. This film just got spookier.
shout out to david bowie's dick
I love Bowie so much. Very creative, I never saw it as a kid but it reminded me of Neverending Story, which was a favorite. Magic is still fun, even as an adult.
Basicaly, the muppets feat Bowie
I’m tripping on peaches and it’s nothing but puppets.  But, seriously, there’s obviously a lot of cool, imaginative stuff in there, and I did like the whole female-hero’s-journey thing. The problem is that it turns out that there is, in fact, such a thing as too many puppets, and when you have a shot with thirty hairy, wrinkled, knobby doodads bouncing around at once it just looks like chaos. Also, great singers are not necessarily great actors.
This film never fails to put a big smile on my face. It's just such a good time from start to finish. Definitely a film to raise the kids on.
Jim Henson knows how to work those puppets!
This is weird yet very fun!!!
You're getting David Bowie, Jim Henson Goblins, fantasy, and a beautiful score? What more could you ask for
I couldn’t help but to laugh at every crotch shot scene of David Bowie
Although it's really weird it has decent messages in it. You get to see a character grow and change and impact the lives of others on the way. Children will love it.
Classic, masterful world-building from Jim Henson
A favorite, might as well revisit for Halloween.
Do you think that if David Bowie did a full frontal nude scene in this movie, his pubic hair would be an identical miniature of his head hair? 🤔
it’s more than an adventure. you need to learn about yourself to find the right way out. hardest decisions pared with the cutest characters you’ve ever seen...in my city we call it „schöne kombinaciòn". the structure of the labyrinth seems like a methaphor for life. breathtaking.
this gave me nightmares when i first watched it
it's a lot of fun, zero denying that some of it didn't age well though, like that uh CGI owl woof
George Lucas produced and Jim Henson directed this gothic fantasy which pits living and breathing actors Jennifer Connelly and David Bowie (who, along with Trevor Jones, provides the film's music) against a motley collection of Muppet monsters. The film centers upon teenage Sarah (Connelly), who lives in a fantasy world of myth and magic, evil spells, and wondrous enchantment. She is baby-sitting her little brother when she cavalierly wishes that goblins would take him away. She gets her wish, and a coterie of goblins abduct him. She then encounters Jareth (David Bowie), the ruler of a mystical world one step removed from reality. He tells Sarah that the only way to get her brother back is to find her way through a M.C. Escher-like labyrinth and find the castle at the center. As she makes her way through the maze, she faces a number of horrific challenges (like the Bog of Eternal Stench) before she finds her way to the gravity-defying castle, where her brother is being held by the evil goblins.
This movie is a ton of fun with magnificent puppetry, gorgeous scenery, wonderful characters, especially Ludo and Didymus, and a truly captivating performance by the late, great David Bowie. There's only one thing that holds this film back and, unfortunately, that thing is Jennifer Connelly. Her performance is rather wooden and her character is just not particularly compelling, and her being the focal point drags down the rest of the film. Otherwise, Labyrinth is an absolutely delightful watch that comes highly recommended. "Dance, magic, dance!"
for a movie with 10,000 puppets, practical effects, cool looking sets, and david frikkin' bowie, this one left me kind of shrugging???
Everything about this movie that elevates it to cult classic status holds up all these years later. Love the sequence with the pit of hands and I needed more of that little caterpillar guy.
this probably would have been a lot better if i was 10.
I've always been drawn to Jim Henson's creations, so I don't know why it took me so long to see this. Labyrinth is a mesmerizing and potent cocktail, the best metaphor for the transitional period of teenagerhood that I can think of-- adventurous fantasy antics and silly muppet sidekicks, enmeshed with the very adult, but equally fantastical, presence of David Bowie. It's an inspired combination, and Jennifer Connelly (channeling the same kind of energy she did in Phenomena, which isn't what I expected) is the perfect heroine to navigate it.
This movie is insane, different, imaginative, fun, creepy, and has David Bowie as a singing Goblin King that kidnaps babies with his Jim Henson muppet goblin minions. It’s fantastic.
Labyrinth is one of my all time favourite films. Every choice that they made in making this film was fantastic. The film itself is silly, every scene carries with it that strangely family friendly but funny quality to it that made The Muppets so great in the first place. But to such a higher level. The characters and costumes are great. I mean sure you can see every detail of David Bowie's clearly visible penis in every shot he's in, but the outfit is still memorable and grandiose, much like everyone else in the film. The set design and puppets were perfect. CGI and other special effects will never compare to practical real life effects I feel, and it really feels like masters were at work in turning the entire world itself into one gigantic work of art. On top of that, the music has that great 80's flair to it, the dialogue and lines are fantastic, and all the characters are some of the most likeable characters there can be. If I had any criticism, its that there are certainly some parts which are a bit cringy nowadays, and definitely some poor green screening at points. But on the whole, I'm just sad I never grew up with this film and I had to watch it when I was older, because if I ever had children then I'd want them to watch this.
that was A LOT
Starring the amazing Henson puppets, catchy music, beautiful set design. Also David Bowie's crotch.
A bit too weird.
A patchwork quilt sewn by Jim Henson, Frank Oz and David Bowie, paid for by George Lucas. By all means, this movie should not work but by some miracle it does.
A fabulous depiction of the unreliable narrator, drawing inspiration from classics such as The Wizard of Oz and Alice in Wonderland. You can tell David Bowie had an absolute blast starring in this. I especially loved how true to life his music stayed, kindof reinforcing the idea that our protagonist is drawing inspiration for her daydream from both fiction and real life. Perhaps even breaks the 4rth wall there a little bit. I know if I had an epic adventure story about me I'd want Bowie showering me with attention too, so.
You remind me of the babe (what babe? ) The babe with the power (what power? ) The power of voodoo (who do? ) You do (do what? ) Remind me of the babe I saw my baby, crying hard as babe could cry What could I do?

It has some interesting set designs and a film involving Henson, Bowie and Terry Jones could never be boring. Well done also to a young Jennifer Connelly.
The Wizard of Oz on drugs, but actually much more intelligent than it may appear on the surface. Throw in a couple of David Bowie musical numbers and you really can’t go wrong.
if your favorite version of david bowie is jareth, then i have news for you: you’re gay.

The puppetry is fantastic. Probably the best I have ever seen out of Jim Henson studio. But... the film is a long and dull journey. The characters can be grating at times and I really didn't care for the music. Not my bag.
David Bulgy more like But wow this was weird, mainly cos it seemed like it was only a light tone shift away from being a really interesting and surreal piece
this is one of my favourite films as a kid but honestly what the fuck is going on here, it’s a hot mess and i love it
god. this was So good. i’ve never taken an interest into david bowie but the synopsis of this movie sounded super intriguing when i was looking for movies earlier today, and BOY this did not disappoint. i loved every single one of sarah’s companions and was oddly on the edge of my seat for most of the movie. 10/10!!!! i would say this is now one of my favorite movies!!
It may be 32 years old,but Jim Henson's musical adventure fantasy starring a young doe eyed Jennifer Connolly is a remarkable achievement in the genre. Memorable characters especially a scene stealing performance by the late rock legend David Bowie.
When I was a child I watched this movie at least once a week because it was the only one at my grandmas house besides the land before time. RIP David Bowie and I love you Jennifer Connelly
this was so boring oh my god im sorry i really tried but its just not for me. this was the first movie in a while that i actually fell ASLEEP to... anyway the best characters were ludo and ambrosius !
borefest. david bowie crotch made me so uncomfortable
i lusted for bowie’s character at an inappropriate age
I was supposed to watch Pan's Labyrinth and screwed up but you know what? This owns.
And with one foul swoop, David Bowie made certain his streak of only appearing in dog shite movies would remain untainted. I'm not sure I can get across how terrible a movie this is. Imagine the most unoriginal school play, but with a budget. And even then the effects are very hit and miss.
Incredible. Not a thing i didnt like.
I wouldn't call this film a well acted film but the practical effects and puppets done by fucking Jim Henson (yeah the creator of the Muppets) who directed this film is fantastic. It drags in places and can be very weird and Bowie's original music is not as good as I was hoping, but it has a lot of heart, humor, and whimsy to pull it through. 8/10 full of things I love but definitely not a greatly acted character drama.
It's so good. I genuinely think it's one of the great films of the 80s. The puppetry is a demonstration of a true master at work. And the screenplay, by Python member Terry Jones, is simply wonderful. I love this film.
Phew that was a trip
Yup, this was a movie alright.
Absolute classic. Holds up better than I thought it would.
Bowie at what might well be his most attractive. A future Oscar winner. A soundtrack that works perfectly. And a ballroom sequence that makes Cinderella look mundane. This is one I rewatch because it's a joy.
I mean the babby is called Toby
You what I think the creepiest part of Labyrinth is... David Bowie having the hots for a sixteen old. Still can't get magic dance out of my head. (10/10)- Out standing ''Sarah... go into your room, play with your toys and your costumes... forget about the baby.''
I don’t know if there’s any movie that gives me more joy than this one.
Super fun to watch. Has good song and dance. Funny moments and fun riddles. Great characters. A classic.
This is a very style over substance movie. Admittedly the story is a little goofy and Jennifer Connelly's constant whining gets a little grating but the music, the animatronics, the visuals, the humor, the creativity, David Fucking Bowie! It's everything you could ever want out of Jim Henson, George Lucas, David Bowie, and Monty Python all working on the same film.
Animatronic puppets, music, a fantasy world, and David Bowie's bulge. What else could you want out of a movie? Edit: Okay so I rewatched this movie yesterday and now I'm giving it a real review. I think I first watched this movie when I was 6ish. My dad was a huge fan of sci-fi and fantasy movies so I got exposed at a very young age to a lot of things I'm not sure I should have been (thanks for scarring and confusing me for 10 years when I walked in on the ending of Carrie). Labyrinth is weird. It's about an s young girl (my best estimate was 15/16) who is asked nicely to babysit her little brother maybe once a week while her dad and step-mom go out on a date. Of course, she gets mad and compared her life to the lives of a 16th century African American. In a fit of rage, she says the magic words and asks the goblin king (David Bowie) to take away this child. Jennifer Connely gives an extremely mediocre performance. Her lines are exaggerated and almost yelled at some points. David Bowie gives a performance you'd expect. Kinda rapey but in the end he a believable goblin king (wait why is the goblin king human?). The practical effects are where this movie find its stride. Some of the most beautiful wells made sets and costumes that I've ever seen in a fantasy movie. Everyone from Hoggle to Ludo is brought to life by great puppeteering and the amazing artists who built them. Maybe I'm just nostalgic but I love this movie and will love it everytime I watch it just like I did when I was a kid
I am so, so here for anything Bowie related
Halloween Countdown Day 1 the puppets are nightmare fuel
Over thirty years on and there's still an endless imagination to Labyrinth that you can't help but get sucked into. It's actually been quite a bit of time since I've watched Jim Henson's venture into the weird and wonderful world of the Goblin King but the movie still holds up really well. You can forgive movies of a few decades age of a few dodgy effects but even with the classic 80's CGI it's still wonderful to watch and a movie that comes packed with such charm and child-like imagination to it that it really works for all ages. Plus what more would you want from a movie than David Bowie swanning about juggling crystal balls singing his heart away about goblins? Let's not beat around the bush here though - Labyrinth is super hammy. It is so over exaggerated in every way but I insist that people don't real this as an insult because it's part of what makes it such a fun thing to watch. A young Jennifer Connelly over-reacting to everything and not necessarily being too worried about being swept away into this fantastical world of goblins and crazy environments is actually quite fun when it sounds a bit ridiculous on paper. It's all whipped into a fairly simplistic plot - baby get's stolen by the goblin king, get through the labyrinth to save the baby - but because of Henson's pure imagination and creativity it makes it a much more enjoyable to movie to watch beyond the storyline. There's so many visual choices that stand out for me watching Labyrinth again that make it so memorable. One of the latter scenes in the movie has Bowie's Goblin King crooning his way around an example of Escher's staircase mazes with Connelly's Sarah still looking to rescue her brother that I just love to watch because it encompasses all the things that are good about Labyrinth - weirdness, silliness and Bowie. The character designs too are great to watch with Henson's work on the goblins and inhabitants of the Goblin King's world having a tremendous amount of character to them. It's a movie that wouldn't really work in any other era and has the right amount of 80's feel to it to make that style work to its advantage even in an age where CGI can make everything look 'better' but not necessarily have the same level of charm. Plus you've got the man himself, the Goblin King, David Bowie. You just can't imagine anyone else in that role. He makes for an enjoyable villain in his ice cold stare working alongside his posing and his... unavoidable southern eyeline. Yet for me it's the soundtrack that accompanies Labyrinth that really makes Jareth work. There's something oddly amusing about a villain singing away his plans in a Beauty and the Beast-esque way and just prancing about in his castle singing away but because it's David Bowie you can't really take your eyes off it all - probably because the music is unsurprisingly great. Just don't ask him who you remind him of. Yes, Labyrinth is campy and it is silly and over exaggerated but because of its era and because of that undeniable charm that comes oozing out of Jim Henson's work like this you can't help but fall in love with it. It's a movie that can work for all generations and have a little something that can enthral in all of its weirdness. even after all this time it remains great fun to watch and looks really great too despite those aged 80's CGI moments being so obvious but when you roll with The Goblin King's quirks and madness then how can you not sit back and enjoy Labyrinth?
I mean. Sentimental... I love this movie. Even if Jennifer Connelly's character is a little insufferable at times. I'm in love with David Bowie a little...
the jumpsuits David Bowie wore with his junk just hanging out .... no thanks
Looking back on David Bowie's filmography, it's hard not to feel a little nostalgic for the singer rather than the actor. Most of his films that aren't cult favourites like The Man Who Fell To Earth or Merry Christmas Mr. Lawrence, tend to see Bowie as a supporting player rather than the main attraction. Labyrinth may well have Bowie as the big name on the bill, but he's outshone by a galaxy of puppets courtesy of Jim Henson's workshop, and a fifteen year old Jennifer Connelly who's about to blossom into one of the late eighties most beautiful women. In this musical fantasy Bowie plays a goblin king who kidnaps a child at the behest of Connelly's Sarah who inadvertently wishes him into doing so. It's then up to Sarah to rescue her brother within a certain timeframe before he's turned into a goblin forever. I'm hardly the demographic for this film, it's a kiddie flick, or one for Bowie completists, but I actually watched it for Connelly. For a film that is very highly regarded, much like The Princess Bride is, I struggled to get into this despite the fun factor of Bowie doing his best Ziggy Stardust impersonation and wearing his own clothes. He sings too, sometimes it's like a bad episode of Sesame Street, and I did start to wonder what all the fuss was about? Cult film? Yeah, I get that, but the amount of Best Of Lists that this is on here on LB is quite astounding, maybe it's that nostalgia factor for some of us of a certain age, but I couldn't quite work it out.
You ever wonder what would happen if Jim Henson, David Bowie, and George Lukas smoked crack and made a movie? This is your answer.
the musical numbers truly are jams
Happy that this is out there
My all time favourite childhood movie with a range of unique characters and scenes. It’s interesting for me how they used puppets as characters and how the actors had to create relationships with them to portray a convincing story. The editing is obvious which is expected from a 1980’s movie but It gives a great nostalgic feel and it was used very effectively. An example is the scene is the castle when Sarah tries to get Toby back but a confusing set of stairs and arches is in the way. The editors edited David Bowie so that it looked like he was walking upside own and rotating around each ledge. This amused me as a child and so the editing was a success in my eyes. Also the soundtrack is amazing 😊
I would have enjoyed this more as a small child. Some pretty cool puppetry, and fun David Bowie music, but the story really dragged. It's no Dark Crystal, that's for sure.
Scared me really bad as a kid. I will never forgive David Bowie for this movie.
Wonder and excitement. No matter how many times I see this movie, I'm still filled with that same sense of wonder. When I first saw this movie as a kid, it made me realize that movies could be magical and enthralling. It's not a flawless movie by any means. But it is endearing and charming. Plus, David Bowie. This movie introduced me to Bowie.
Brilliant fun. My expectations of this were so low that I was almost blown away with how much I enjoyed it. What a wonderful adventure, and it kept surprising me with new and fantastic characters. Great soundtrack! Love that synth.   If I was pushed I would say this film is about some of the characters learning to be less arseholes, and the characters who weren’t arseholes to begin with blithely going on as they began.  Overall, very good fun. However, parts of it were very confusing, I got quite bored at the end, and I am not sure I ever want to see it again.
god i remember in uni we played a game where we drank every time we saw david bowie's crotch, and because there were like, some scenes where he didn't appear, we also had to drink when the girl whined at all absolutely wasted by the end
Definitely a much better watch than the last time I saw this. Maybe someday it’ll return to its rightful place as a favorite.  But for now, it was a good rewatch.
Now don’t let my 3 fool you, this is still a really fun adventure. The amount of artistry put into design. Only a certain mind could come up with something like this.  I would never say no to David Bowie and glitter
A very entertaining fantasy musical that I've inexplicably never seen until now.
My first time watching this since the days of VHS..I still enjoyed it.
The faggy fox with ADHD is a gay icon. Representation matters!!!!
This is the movie that introduced a young me to fantasy. It will forever hold a place in my heart for that and seeing it in a theatre was a real treat.
Should you need us...
This is one of the strangest movies I’ve ever seen and this would NEVER be released in 2018. The 80’s were a VERY strange time for film, and this is one of the most unique and creative films I’ve seen in recent memory, and while I didn’t fully enjoy it, I can appreciate the pure insanity of it. It gives off a special charm that you don’t see much today. Seeing it theatres also made it that more strange.   7/10.
This is one of my all time favorites. Each time I watch it I swear I love it just a little more. From the practical sets to the magical score, I will forever be grateful for Jim Henson bringing thhis into existence.
If you don’t like this movie. Don’t talk to me. Period. But seriously though, this movie is such a masterpiece! Great anamatronics, amazing practical fx, and incredible filming, also the costumes were awesome aswell. It makes it even better that George Lucas’s was working with them back when he was in his prime. This will always be a legendary film. Jim Henson will always be the puppet king.
The Hat: [as she and Hoggle goes off after sacrificing a contribution for basically nothing] Well, well then, there go a couple of suckers.  ... I wanna tear my own head off after that brutal number, jesus.
Pretty much the movie that whacked me upon the head and made me a David Bowie (the singer) fan, when I bought it on DVD in mid-2006 in my quest at collecting nostalgia movies from my childhood. Loves this movie to pieces.
Watched @ GQT in Savoy
Saw this on the "Big Screen" for the first time since it originally came out. I do love these movie theaters that show older films in the format that they were intended. Makes SO MUCH difference! Revisiting this childhood favorite, I was reminded of how much I have seen certain scenes time and time again... BUT... have not seen the very beginning hardly at all. I was shocked at how much I had forgotten about how this gets started (with Connelly quoting lines from a storybook that she has memorized, all dressed up as a maiden in the park). Then as the Bowie enters and the Goblins steal the baby, we get rolling with some of the most creative stuff to ever come out of the Henson idea factory. It's just WILD and CRAZY and UTTERLY CREATIVE work. Brian Froud's creature designs are grotesquely appropriate and delightful. I love so much about this movie. The craziness of the story, the awesome Bowie music, the production design and the fantastic puppetry going on. It's a sheer delight all around. So glad I got to see this again up on a huge movie screen. (I dock it a 1/2 star, only because Connelly's acting up front is very - how shall I say - limited. She is not good at the beginning of this film. But once she gets to the Labyrinth, she's better. I had not remembered her acting being so weak here. But there ya go).
I don't think I can really recall how many times I've seen this film, but I can usually remember the context of each time I viewed it. (Or at least a lot of the times I've seen it.) Mostly with friends and how we bonded over the film and how there was always a part of me that felt jaded that my love of Bowie existed outside of this film while theirs existed inside. Perhaps it's silly, but when someone thinks of a campy lowbrow existence of your idol compared to what you love about them, maybe it's okay. It's not like I go out of my way to shame people because I still enjoy this film regardless. Anyways, here are some of the ways in which I remembered viewing this (not in chronological order): - On the first date with my first boyfriend. That was also the first time I touched someone else's dick. - The weekend after Bowie died and my friend Erin came over and we watched this and The Hunger. - With my friends after helping one of them move into their apartment. - The first time I saw it in theaters (in 2016) with a friend who also had a love for Bowie. - The time I showed it to my sister and she had nightmares about David Bowie stealing babies. - The first time I watched it in sophomore year of high school and decided I needed to start looking more into this Bowie guy and listen to his music. (Which would be A Reality Tour since these were the only two Bowie related things at my public library!) - I'm sure there are other times I watched this casually without thinking much about it. So I admit this film turned me on to Bowie and I can't fault others who never took the leap to discover more of his stuff.
a childhood favorite
This musical fantasy is the cult classic collaboration of 3 geniuses, Jim Henson- the creator of the Muppets, George Lucas- the creator of Star Wars and David Bowie- the creator of glam rock who dazzles and charms in this film as the villainous Jareth the Goblin King opposite Academy Award winner Jennifer Connelly as Sarah. Henson took his art of puppetry to new heights with this '80s classic.
i couldnt stop smiling ! this movie was the best thing to happen to me as a child !
A cult classic Fantasy musical featuring the creator of Star Wars as executive producer This is definitely a fun movie and David Bowie definitely owns his role And Jim Henson did a great job with this film and all the puppets look great
I cannot stand the scene with those stupid headless Muppets.
I have already seen this film in a theater three times this year and I would do it again.
"You have no power over me."
David Bowie, muppets, a cute baby, and an 80’s synth soundtrack. Does it get better than this? Not really.
you remind me of the babe
My first time with this. It's one of many 1980s childhood classics that I just never encountered as a kid, never felt compelled to see as a teen/college student, and now watch at the unfortunate remove of an adult. All of which made the film by turns enchantingly strange and frustratingly tiresome to me. Henson's drawing on a motley crew of inspirations: Lewis Carroll, Monty Python (Terry Jones wrote the script), glam rock, obviously M.C. Escher. When that base material emerges to the forefront--the Escherian climax, the Carrollinian uncanniness and creepiness, the ball sequence, Bowie's bulge--this really works as a blast of pure childhood, fairy-tale anxiety. Jareth is explicitly an element in Sarah's mind, and he's at once a sexualized glitter demon and a child's primal fantasy of a kidnapping brute, with Satanic tendencies to match (he's also a tempter...). But the narrative's potential is cramped by the constant need to stop and solve various puzzles, which grows repetitive (same goes for the Alice books, I guess). Also--and this is a Me Thing--the movie is very much a puppet show, with sets to match: everything feels wonderfully handmade and tactile, save for a few glimpses of ghastly early CGI, but it also feels so...miniature and dare I say uncinematic. There's just no expansiveness. A child would obviously see things differently. This is a grouchy review. Anyway, kids should see it, what the hell do I know.
I don't know why I watched this because I don't like goblins.
I wish somebody would’ve told me there would be singing and dancing, ‘cause I would’ve watched this a lot sooner. I loved all the musical numbers and watched them two or three times before moving on. The music is super good—who knew David Bowie was such a great musician, huh? ;) I particularly loved the Magic Dance, and that Baroque ball sequence simply blew me away. The Escher-esque stairways towards the end with the baby crawling around and Bowie upside down was very cool, too, and the list could go on. It’s simply exploding with creativity, and great care has been put into every detail. Maybe I expected a little more metaphors and symbolism relating to Sarah’s transition from girlhood to womanhood while on her journey through the labyrinth, more “life lessons”, if that makes sense, but it’s very likely that one might discover more and more upon repeat viewings. I certainly will revisit. I believe great art happens when you’re not trying to make great art, and I found that here.
Good concept art all over... But that's pretty much it.
Who is the Goblin King? He's clearly human, but the only other humans in the "Labyrinth" world are the ones at the masquerade ball. But are those humans even real? Sarah shatters the illusion and escapes, implying that those humans were all fake. Therefore, is Jareth the only Human that lives in the Labyrinth world? I Imagine it like this: Jareth discovered the Labyrinth world. Simply by being much smarter than the Goblins and manipulating them, he became their king. He then enforces the goblins to build his castle and the labyrinth around it. Why? Because no one on earth cared about his music. Look at the "Dance Magic" scene. He just breaks into song and the Goblins LOVE it. They're so dumb, and simply play along the whole time, clueless about everything. What babe? What Power? Voodoo? The goblins are mostly too dumb to make their own music (good luck writing lyrics) and when the first musically capable person ever walks into their village, they lose their minds and immediately make him king. Also, is Hoggle a goblin?
What do you get when you mix the dark puppeted plots of Jim Henson and the antics of a rock star? Labyrinth. This film is weird and it makes David Bowie look like a creep (that might be cause he is idk). But, it’s pretty funny, most of that comes from the absurdity which, can be borderline annoying but if you find that kind of stuff enjoyable your probably like this film. 6.5/10
David Bowie Loves Contact Juggling David Bowie Fushigi Tutorial
Lots of highs and lots of lows for this one. Probably would have liked it more if I grew up with it.
Admire the practical effects but it sure is boring
Wacky is about all I can say. With a rousing turn by David Bowie as The Goblin King.
Big plot hole in this movie. Supposedly, Sarah only has thirteen hours to save her baby brother, but the scene with the Fireys and the whole sequence in the Bog of Eternal Stench together drag on for at least thirteen hours each. Still, if you've got a day to kill, there really is not a better popcorn movie than this.
If you’re a big fan of puppetry and creature effects like I am, this whole movie will be a treat. However, if the movie was exactly the same, but was animated, it wouldn’t be very good at all. Visually the movie is a 5/5 but has story and pacing issues.
the bulge ,,, can’t take my eyes off of it -gnomey 😳
Haven’t seen this since studying it at school.  It was fortunately less disturbing. Terry Jones’ input was very apparent now I know who he is, the inhabitants of the labyrinth are very much like Wonderland characters via the absurdity of the Pythons. It’s also a little saddening that our musical landscape is devoid of any weirdos who I could see making something like this. Lady Gaga is probably the closest we’ve got and whatever A Star Is Born is, Labyrinth it ain’t.
I feel like if you saw this as a kid you'd love it now. I enjoyed it but there is a huge gap between how much I like it vs. how much people love it that could only be bridged by nostalgia. The CGI owls are so laughable I thought that it was intentional to slander CGI because it was taking jobs from puppeteers.The audio is so off it makes you feel like the actors are puppets too. I really like a lot of the muppets and their character design. A lot of the concepts are imaginative. I thought the Shaft of Hands was so cool. It's some fun whacky fun.
A delight to watch. I admire The Dark Crystal for being so ambitious, but Labyrinth is so much fun, and another great fantasy film by Jim Henson.
Even though he's not actually singing "Slap that baby, make him pee," you and I both know that makes more sense.
I’m sorry but this was so shit, I can how I liked it as a kid but now it’s just shit.
David Bowie's crotch.
As the pain sweeps through Makes no sense for you Every thrill is gone Wasn't too much fun at all But I'll be there for you As the world falls down I didn't discover this movie until I was a teenager, but I more than made up for lost time after that. There was a while there where this was on constant rotation with me and my friends. Because of that, every Bowie track is thankfully forever etched in my brain. Revisiting it now, it's still a perfect movie. The HD quality shows all the visible strings people/puppets are dangling from, the dated special effects, etc., yet everything about Labyrinth is just as magical to me as it was back then. Bowie is the epitome of cool, bulge and all. Jim Henson is a genius, obviously. And Jennifer Connelly is on the verge of being a movie star. Yeah, Labyrinth is fucking beyond and such a moment in time.
Come for the wacky Jim Henson puppets, stay for the fantasy David Bowie tight pants.
I should rewatch this now that I appreciate David Bowie more.
David Bowie wanted to smash a 15 year old and a goblin muppet wanted a piece too
All I can say is if you have never watched this film u must do it now it is the definition of amazing and David Bowie definitely could of just done acting but gave us a beautiful gift of music he created.
Bowie is just completely show-stopping as Jareth and I forgot one of the Monty Python guys wrote teh script so there's a lot of just stupidly funny lines too. The MC Escher scene at the end is so cool, and I can't believe I forgot that Bowie is CONTACT JUGGLING like half the time what the fuck. also the music is fantastic cause of course bowie did all of it
One of those movies I did not particularly take to in childhood and rewatching it now as an adult not much has changed. Strange though to think that in a childhood spent watching Michael Jordan ward off aliens, Robin Williams cross-dressing, Bat-Nipples, Depp as a monster with Scissorhands and Michael Keaton as an insane ghost that Labyrinth was where I decided to draw the line.
I liked this a bit more than The Dark Crystal... but not by a great deal. The songs were fairly good and David Bowie and Jennifer Connelly were both good, but once again I just struggled to really get into it. And once again a lot of it is due to the aesthetic. Nothing really grabbed me and I wasn’t bored but wasn’t really entertained either. Labyrinth was an ok time killer for me, but nothing much more than that. Though I do really admire the puppet work. Typical quality we’ve come to expect from a Jim Henson production.
I'm so grateful that the wall scene is still able to blow my mind
Weird and other wordly. For me, a clash of the clangers, pans labyrinth, alice in wonderland and adventure time,  naturally, these all came after this film. Much enjoyment of David Bowie in his tights. As a realist, greenscreen work was hard to overcome.
You remind me of the babe! What babe? The babe with the power!! Checked this out on the big screen last night for the first time ever, I can’t believe it took me so long to watch it. It’s such a cool movie, totally an example of its time, David Bowie was the coolest person ever, period. Amazing puppetry too. I loved how it’s the kind of movie that so easily could’ve been terrible but instead is a total classic that warms the heart.
Even though the young girl in this movie is overaly dramatic in every way possible I can understand why this movie is a loved classic... With creatures of all kinds & a adventure you’d like to take this film isn’t short in the creative category  If the catchy toons & pretty colors don’t catch your attention maybe the fact that a grown man is in love with a young teen might....  overall this movie was corny in all the right ways & is a good classic watch
Somehow with every viewing this movie gets better. I love it so much, and I don't know if I'm just jaded since I grew up with this movie and am in love with Bowie. This is a really fun and enjoyable movie with a phenomenal soundtrack. I can't get enough.
Not sure on the main actress. But this is one goddamn tight creative film. Surprisingly humourous, David Bowie is just awesome and fits in so well. The songs are absolutely insane but super catchy. Yeah, I really enjoyed it.
In Filmaffinity it note is a 7’2.
The puppets, sets, matte paintings, effects, imagination, etc are all top notch and a lot of fun. Unfortunately Jennifer Connelly has the charisma of a wet log which really drags the film down (SHE HAS THE SAME EXPRESSION ON HER FACE THE ENTIRE TIME!!!) and the musical numbers are not very good. I would rather just watch the films that this was inspired by (The Wizard of Oz and Alice in Wonderland).
i really didn't like this movie and i feel bad cuz it really isn't that bad, it's quite endearing, but i feel like you would've had to seen this before as a young kid if you wanted to like it in general. i'm 16 and this is my first time watching it and it just got so tedious and i didn't understand the end. what the fuck was supposed to happen? are you supposed to analyze this movie or is it just incoherent? did her mom leave her the labyrinth book? why did sarah and jareth have so much built up romantic tension? i feel like i didn't watch a correct version of a movie that was supposed to be wonderful.
If you don't like this, blame Canada.
My friend came over to my house and hadn't seen this so I obviously had to show it to him
So stupid it's funny. Immature humor, but great soundtrack.
It's purile, the animation sucks, and it could probably offend most minority groups. But my God is it funny!! I would seriously rank it alongside Life of Brian. And as a musical it could easily mix with the finest theatre productions with song structures to die for. The plot is tight and fast paced too. It's Satan (and Sadaam) that crack me up each time. And the song "Up There" is just perfect. There seems to be a little detail to enjoy afresh each time too. I may never get tired of this film.
One of the best musical films of the last 30 years. I’m not even joking. This movie is clever, hilarious and a damn good time. Gotta love South Park.
When I was in fifth grade, the principal of my school sent a letter home to our parents warning them not to let their kids watch South Park. I think I watched South Park for the first time that week. Since then, I’ve seen a handful of episodes. It’s always funny, but I’ve never been a big fan and will go years without watching the show. That being said, Bigger, Longer, and Uncut is pretty fuckin’ funny, mkay.
This film has taught me the most important lesson about life: blame Canada for everything. I spilled my drink, blame Canada. My dog chewed on my shoes, blame Canada. Canada has just been nuked, blame Canada.
"Off to the movies we shall go Where we learn everything that we know  Cus' the movies teach us what our parents don't have time to say!!!!!" Still fantastic. I miss old school South Park.
Even though I rewatched this last week, I found myself humming the songs to myself nonstop since I watched it. So I thought why not? Let's do this again. And man, this movie is ten million times better than it needed to be. I'm sure most would've been happy with a version of this movie that was just an extended episode, but it's so much more than that. Anyone who looks at this and thinks it's just a bunch of swear words and toilet humor is full of shit. Sure it has that, but it has so much heart and wit to go along with the vulgarity. Despite the crude animation, each frame is filled with clever details and funny Easter eggs that add to the scene rather than just being there for fans to recognize. And while the references are dated, the film's conflict and message is timeless and has aged far better than some of the newer episodes from just last year. It takes a lot of skill and restraint to make a film lampooning everyone (from the studio executives, disgruntled parents, and politicians) who seems to be against your art without seeming ham handed or preachy. And the songs. Holy crap every single song in this movie is a damn masterpiece. All of them are charming, funny, full of great lines, and insanely catchy. Every song just makes me smile, no matter what fucked up shit is happening on screen or what horrifying thing the song is about. Any movie that can make songs sung by gay lovers Saddam Hussein and Satan charming and funny, or make me even think about singing a song about fucking your uncle in public deserves all the praise it gets. This is the movie that sausage party was trying to be, but unlike that ass blast, this movie actually has some humanity behind it's crudeness. Plus it helps when your writers actually have some talent as well.
I have a definite soft spot for the TV show and thought it was time to watch the movie. It's very funny! I love the self-referential humor, and all around it was quite a hoot. Good stuff all around.
"Remember what the MPAA says; Horrific, Deplorable violence is okay, as long as people don't say any naughty words! That's what this war is all about!" A satirical conglomerate poking fun at as many social issues as humanely possible, and then some. South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut is the perfect transition into the big screen because it adheres to the storytelling powers that the very best of the series posseses. 'Therefore and But'. It's a simple concept of writing, removing "and then" in the script process so the story can progress with ease and clarity. But under Stone and Parker, each beat is an otherwise greater step, an avalanche of hysterical malevolence. From inappropriate movies to blaming Canada, Brian Boitano and relationship issues with the Devil, the beauty of South Park is one that shouldn't make sense, but does. This is why their 1999 foray into the big screen is one of the best comedies of its time, perfectly composed and hilariously inappropriate, covering a wide scope of issues in a perfectly paced 81 minutes. I haven't even mentioned the musical sequences which are divine and memorable in their own fu**ed up way. The Book of Mormon, one of the funniest experiences I've ever had in my life, finally makes sense now.
I kind of adored this.
This is technically my first complete viewing of this, though I caught 95% of it on Comedy Central a decade ago (I’d just missed the opening song, which I’d already seen parts of anyway in “Bowling for Columbine”). I’ve never been much of a South Park fan because much of their humor is too gross and nihilistic for my tastes. Still, parts of this movie do make me laugh. Also, I’m glad Kenny got to join those nude angels in Heaven at the end. It’s about time the poor kid got a break.
Trey Parker and Matt Stone are at it again with this movie. The intelligent humor from South Park, and the toilet humor both transition perfectly into this movie. Parker and Stone flexed their musical prowess as well, as this film is a full fledged musical. The movie is very funny and plays a great commentary censorship.
i'm legally obligated to watch this at least once a year
The epitome of South Park's creativity, cleverness and humor. No episode of the show has ever brought me as many laughes or as much investment as this film.
"Why do you always make love to me from behind? Is it because you pretend I'm someone else?" "Satan, your ass is big and red. Who am I gonna pretend you are? Liza Minelli?" It's hard to explain what a pop culture phenomenon SOUTH PARK became in the late '90's. While the show is still going strong today in its 22nd season and continues to have fans, I personally stopped watching around Season 4, which to me contained the show's most iconic and outrageous episodes. There really had never been another series like it at the time, with THE SIMPSONS and FAMILY GUY being the two most obvious comparisons. And of all three of those, SOUTH PARK was the one that made the most successful leap to the big screen, most likely because Trey Parker and Matt Stone made their film when the show was at the peak of its popularity. BIGGER, LONGER & UNCUT feels like more than just a long episode of the show; it feels like an event. It's a fun comedy, has "nothing is sacred" humor, great-looking animation, the apocalypse happening, and on top of that, it's also a really good musical. I think this was the biggest surprise of the movie: that's its songs, written by Tony-winner Marc Shaiman along with Parker, are great Broadway-quality songs, showing a lot of passion for musical variety and Disney conventions. I used to own the soundtrack and played it all the time (though sadly I lost it sometime during freshman year of college). All the songs are great, from the Oscar-nominated "Blame Canada" to "What Would Brian Boitano Do" to "Mountain Town" to "Uncle Fucka" to "La Resistance," to my personal favorite, Satan's sad and moving "Up There." Probably the nicest surprise is "Eyes of a Child" by Michael McDonald, which plays over the end credits. It sounds like the one serious song, until you actually listen to the lyrics and realize it's just as comedic as the rest. The film's plot is self-referential: our four heroes go to see an R-rated movie starring Terrence and Philip only to be overwhelmed by its gratuitous profanity (obviously the film-within-the-film is meant to be a self-parody). The children's parent's overreact and begin a censorship campaign, eventually invading Canada and setting about the apocalypse. Almost every character from the series is able to get a few good gags, along with some celebrity cameos, including Winona Ryder performing a very unique trick with ping pong balls and her vagina. The only element that slightly dates the movie are the jokes about Saddam Hussein. Considering how, only a few years after this film, Hussein would have his country invaded and be publicly executed by the US, portraying his death here in such a lighthearted manner feels flippant, but then again, that's what SOUTH PARK's humor has always been. This whole subplot, in which Satan and Saddam are gay lovers, and poor Satan is really lonely, is one of the funniest and more insane gags of the film. When it comes to what is the best SOUTH PARK episode, fans may have passionate debates, but BIGGER, LONGER & UNCUT represents the franchise at its A-game, with Parker and Stone bringing their best and most profane-yet-smart material to the table. The result is a satire that still holds up, as well as first taught me what menstruation was!
Yup, this movie is still perfect. I know it's not the most popular opinion but this might be one of my favorite comedies, musical, animated films or just films in general. I think everything works, I love the songs, the meta nature of the plot. And everytime I see Kenny take his hood off at the end I get goosebumps. 5/5
“Be Careful Dude.”  “Careful? Was my mother careful, when she stabbed me with a coat hanger while I was still in the womb?”  They better make a sequel, and it better involve Butters singing a showstopping solo number.
Not a wasted moment. One of the most endlessly rewatchable movies there is.  Very glad my wife actually liked it after being resistant for so long but a die-hard Broadway fan including The Book of Mormon.
Still a musical masterpiece! (I can grab a megaphone if you need me to.)
This musical is head and shoulders above what Frozen will ever be
YOU UNCLE FUCKER !!!!!!!!
How did this movie.... No, wait... WHY did this movie ever get made?  I think South Park is okay, especially as a TV show. It’s funny. This movie can be funny. But I read Roger Ebert’s review of this, and I pretty much agree with him: I don’t really feel GOOD about laughing at most of the obscene and over-the-line joke. (There are some that are genuinely funny. I don’t know why but the “Kyle’s Mom” song cracks me up.) But I don’t really think any of the jokes serve the story or the story’s perspective other than questioning just how far over the line you can go. I think that’s what the movie is trying to say, whether it’s about censorship or how media is consumed or whatever. But it seems like the movie is saying even self-censorship is bad, which I think is horribly mistaken.   I just didn’t really like it as a whole. There’s nothing about it that adds to my understanding of film or life or anything really. But, there are some funny jokes; it probably does produce consistent laughs throughout, and it’s an hour and a half that goes by pretty quickly, so that all adds up to about a 2 out of 5.
I HEARD YOU THE FIRST TIME! I’M NOT LOU FERIGNO FOR PETE’S SAKE! I am a big time Trey and Matt fan. There’s a lot I appreciate not only about the humor found in South Park, but in their approach to their multiple (AWARD WINNING) films and stage plays. It will be a sad day when they take their final bow.  I’ve seen every single episode of the show, but somehow I missed the movie which of course, did not disappoint. The things I found funniest? When Bill Gates gets his head blown off for Windows 98. Or how it was the filth that needed up saving the world. Awwww.
I remember being so disappointed when Kenny finally spoke. I don’t know what the fuck I was expecting 🤷‍♂️
South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut is an interesting film. Most of this review will be based on my personal experience since I find it hard to be super objective with films like this. While I've never been the kind of person to religiously watch South Park, I have seen a few episodes, and I can appreciate the tremendous impact it's had on satire, cinema, and popular culture as a whole. So I can definitely understand that I'm not the kind of person the film is aimed at, and that some of the references might go over my head, or the humour might not always strike a chord with me. The comedic aspect of the film was clearly assembled carefully, but I didn't find myself laughing consistently. Maybe it was intentional, but a lot of the jokes misfired (for me, at least). The meta jokes were pretty hilarious, though. The songs in the film are surprisingly good. A good lot of them have been stuck in my head at one point or another, which I would consider a win. After the opening sequence, I wasn't sure the musical aspect would work with South Park's style, but wow did they pull it off. That's easily the most impressive aspect of the film. The writing was incredible, I'll admit that much. If a gay relationship between Saddam Hussein and Satan has more chemistry than the couples in most romcoms, then you know the writing's good. Overall, the film is definitely above average, but I don't see myself returning to it anytime soon. I liked it, but I didn't love it. Even so, the writing, music, and story are surprisingly well put together. I know I'm not the intended audience, and I am being a bit harsh, so take my opinion with a grain of salt. 3.5/5
The best thing about this brilliant South Park movie is not that it is "longer," rather the fact that it is "bigger" and so ambitious: both as an incredibly hilarious comedy and as a musical full of awesome songs, while also upping the vulgarity seen on the TV show to a f***ing eleven.

I am one of the few people who has never seen an episode of South Park (shocking, I know), but I decided to give the movie a try anyway. And I'm so glad I did. While there were definitely running jokes from the series that i didn't get, I was still laughing consistently throughout the whole film. This an excellent example of a tv to film transition: when fans and non-fans can enjoy it. I can imagine people saying "It wasn't funny, it was just swearing." But it was swearing and saying bad language I the right context of the story and the jokes which made the film funny. Fair enough, not everyone has this sort of sense of humour, but for me it was just right. I want to just list off every funny thing in the film, but then I'd just be summarising it. The meta commentary of the content of the film was actually much better than what I expected. Going to war with Canada is a bit extreme, but I can imagine a lot of what happens as a result of the kids seeing 'Asses of Fire' happening in reality with Bigger, Longer and Uncut. The way that Stone and Parker pre-empted every argument that could be used against them by featuring them in the film was hilarious. And there is an obvious, but nonetheless necessary, criticism of the MPAA which is actually socially conscious. And the criticism of outraged parents is spot on, even more so nearly 20 years later when the internet makes angry mobs easier to convene. I shouldn't be too surprised by all these really... Team America was a great movie aswell.
i think i’ll stick to the show thanks
Reasons I love this film: 1. The satire is great. 2. The songs have still managed to be catchy almost twenty years after it's release. 3. The film is hilarious. 4. Not only is the satire great as I mentioned earlier, but the film is very thought-provoking and has a great message about the dangers of censorship. 5. The animation has a real cinematic quality. 6. The film led to the satirical South Park we know today, and I'm grateful for that.
The songs are still pretty funny, but even at 80 minutes it feels a bit too long
South Park is one of my favorite shows if not favorite. This movie basically did exactly what the title said made it bigger,longer and uncut. The humor, animation, themes and musical numbers are cranked up to eleven. This is the perfect movie that encapsulates so much of why I like the show.  5/5 Nah Terrence and Philip is the best show
This film makes you sympathize with fucking Satan. And for that. It gets 5 stars.
I haven't watched South park but this was ok mostly. I liked the bit where Cartman was Goku.
Still the greatest movie of all time.
(Old impressions, not based on a recent viewing) Hilarious as a kid, but I'm not sure it'd match my memory now.
Raunchy and insane.... but that's kind of the point. The social commentary is as strong as it's ever been and Trey Parker and Matt Stone really showed off their talents as Broadway Musical Writers. Definitely worth a watch if you're a fan of the show!
The older I get the less I like this.
BLAME CANADA, BLAME CANADA! THEY’RE NOT A REAL COUNTRY ANYWAY  Still one lf the best animated movies of the 90s. I feel like Parker and Stone are taken for granted, and their worth is not that appreciated. They are the masters of satirical comedy, and also pretty damn good songwriters! The whole soundtrack of this movie is fucking gold.
Imperfect, but consistently fun satire with superb musical numbers. 8/10
It’s crazy to think that South Park got a movie after being on the air for 2 years, although I do think they deserved it. In this they just went full out, it’s probably one of the most ridiculous movies I’ve ever seen, which I loved.  All the humor here is a little darker and absolutely absurd which I’m a fan of, and the fact that it’s a musically makes it quite more comedic. I still have that ridiculous Terrence and Phillips song stuck in my for better or worse.  The craziest thing to think about though is the point this 20 year old movie is trying to get across is just or even more relevant today then it was way back then. The MPAA is still acting like knuckle heads, and even more than ever radical liberals are trying to censor what one can and can’t say. One might even say this film is ahead of its time...
"Remember what the MPAA says; horrific, deplorable violence is okay, as long as people don't say any naughty words! That's what this war is all about!"  Oh man what a fucking joy of a film. It's a smart, raunchy takedown of how shitty the MPAA and rating systems in general can be, as well as groups that insist upon art being the reason for corrupting young people. It's essentially a long, uncensored episode of South Park and it's fucking awesome. I feel in parts it does try to stretch its runtime to be feature length but other than that this film is incredible. Highly recommended. Especially if you're a fan of musicals. There's more than a couple of bangers in here.
Pure perfection from the very first frame all the way to the post credits scene. Not only the best comedy ever made, but probably the best musical ever made. The South Park movie is unapologetic, filthy, hilarious, and intelligent. Not only will you laugh until your side's hurt, and maybe even piss yourself, but you just might learn an important lesson or two. Every song is perfect and I cannot watch without singing along with the biggest smile on my face, even during the credits. While the 90s had some truly great films, in general it was a weak decade for film, but if you watch this masterpiece, you would never be able to tell. I wish I could give this film 10 ☆ because it truly deserves that.
Project Recall - Ok I do remember going to see this one actually. My friend and his parents were over and I guess his dad was bored because he wouldn't stop talking about this movie and offered to take us. So we went. I can't remember if I was already watching the show or not at this point, I guess I was because I think I pretty much loved it. South Park has waned in recent years but this was around their hayday.
Saddam and the Devil stole the movie
"damn! shit! respect my fuckin' authoritah!!" – matt and trey at all other adult cartoons for real, its crazy to see how far south park has grown and evolved, yet still has that same edgy satire and surreal humour which made me fall in love with it in the first place. south park has a very special place in my heart.
"Mom, if you were in a German Scheisse video... you'd tell me right?" "Sure, sweetie" Stone and Parker really have storytelling to a T. Their jokes bounce off other plot threads, and every thread is as important as the last. It's such a fun film too considering the musical element to the film. Every song is a fucking banger epsicially "I'm Super" which is probably my favorite of them, or "Blame Canada" which was nominated for an Oscar... fuck yeah! Yeah. Fucking watch this movie, you fuck.
I’ve never really watched South Park, but this was just an utter blast. It’s chaotic and messy, but in a surprisingly satisfying way. And every time Stan pukes? I lose my goddamn mind. Hilarious on every level. The perfect raunchy animated musical comedy to end a millennium.
Idk how some people can actually not find South Park at least a little funny. It’s just so ridiculous.
9/10 This film is so funny. That's probably my highest praise for this film. It's a really funny musical. Even if you're not a fan of the show, I still recommend it because I laughed a lot throughout the movie. The voice work is great mainly done by Trey Parker and Matt Stone. I think it also delivers a message that is still relevant today. This movie is basically commentary on how people would most likely react to this movie when it came out in the 90s. It also tackles their issues with the MPAA, because that system is really stupid. When the kids see an R rated film and start swearing, all the parents start freaking out. However they don't get mad at the kids, they blame everyone else. Which is still constantly happening nowadays. They freak out that it's too vulgar for children to see and it is. It's rated R. It's not meant for children. However they still blame Canada. A comedic film about censorship is the perfect source material.  The film also involves America blaming a country for something that wasn't directly its fault and going to war with them. One could say that this film might've been ahead of its time. Overall, it's a very funny film with relevant commentary. The comedic timing is so perfect. Also the songs are quite good.
Greatest friggin musical of all time....'cept La La Land.
South Park: Bigger, Longer and Uncut still remains as relevant today as it did when it made its explosive debut in 1999, while also proudly reigning champion as one of the best musicals of all time.
No wonder I curse so much! BLAME CANADA!  "Your moms are just upset, they're probably all on their periods or something." "Mr. Garrison, Wendy and I think that was a sexist statement." "Well, I'm sorry Wendy but I just don't trust anything that bleeds for 5 days and doesn't die."
"And did you bring the butt for?" "What's a butt for?" "For pooping, silly."
what’s a butt for?
This last week we have been moving houses and we found a couple DVD players and this was the test movie but the thing is I just kept watching this movie all the way through.  In my opinion The best TV movie out there and hey, they finally beat the simpsons.
When you grow older, the film's problems become more evident. Regardless, I still love this movie.
"Haven't you heard of the Emancipation Proclamation?" "I don't listen to hip-hop." I haven't revisited this one in years and it still makes me laugh hard. While I am not the biggest fan of current South Park, the show holds a formative place in my heart. It managed to combine dick jokes with actual subversive political commentary and that's true here. This movie is fucking hilarious, maintaining the style and humor of the show while taking it further than the show could at the time. No stone is left unturned and no line is not crossed. Satan is not only a sympathetic gay character in this film...he has a Disney princess style ballad that manages to not only be fun but tear at your heart strings a little bit. There is something for everyone to be offended by in this movie while also having a relevant message about censorship. The idea of putting these characters into a Disney style musical is so inspired and fun. It also helps that the musical numbers are genuinely brilliant and catchy, especially the Oklahoma inspired Uncle Fucka, Blame Canada, and La Resistance. I had a great time revisiting this and I wish Trey and Matt would make another movie or something.
Despite some reliance on outdated pop culture gags, South Park: Bigger, Longer, and Uncut holds up surprisingly well due to its broadway-style musical songs, deceptively smart political & social commentary, and gut-bursting comedy. There's a reason the Broadway musical legend Steven Sondheim said that this was his favorite musical of all time.
Anyone who grew up in the 1990s can likely remember the thunderbolt of liberating inappropriateness that was, and still is, “South Park.” Gleefully tearing down good taste and censorship while incisively refuting much of the necessity for social graces, the show was a juggernaut before it was lost to its creators’s arrogance and vituperative personal grievances. Looking back, the movie shows all the best “South Park” had to offer, and the laugh-out-loud jokes are thrown like rhetorical grenades at the audience over and over. There are few comedies that are so consistently risky and hilarious, pushing the boundaries of acceptable cinema in nearly every scene while also keeping its humor rooted somewhere between the juvenile and the politically excoriating, resulting in one of the angriest, funniest, ballsiest studio comedies ever released. With a running time barely over eighty minutes, the movie moves at breakneck speed, never stopping to catch its breath or allowing the audience to do the same, but also not sacrificing density at the altar of brevity.
Terrance, why would you call me a pig-fucker?  Well let’s see. First of all, you fuck pigs.  Oh yeah.
What little I’ve seen of South Park has never made me laugh. Perhaps if I came across it when I was in middle school that kind of humor where the fact that there is a lot of foul language from kids would make me laugh. South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut was just taking the show concept to its ultimate conclusion without the restriction of censors, and even referencing itself. So it’s an inappropriate movie making fun of how inappropriate movies are treated as dangerous. It’s also a musical for some reason. I couldn’t figure out why it would break into song occasionally, but I guess the one compliment I can pay the movie is that the songs had catchy tunes which I could see becoming earworms. One thing that has always bugged me is that the art style is awful to a distracting degree. I know it’s all kind of intentional, but I don’t like looking at it and find it annoying that characters all look the same aside from their clothes. I know there are others who love this cartoon, and even think this film is brilliant, but I struggle to see why something like this is praised and The Happytime Murders crashed-and-burned critically and at the box office. In both cases it feels like the primary source of humor is just being crass, but because it comes from the innocent mouths of children in a cartoon (or puppets) we’re supposed to laugh. I think the self-referential nature of this movie might make it resonate more for people, and maybe they are bringing positive emotions from their enjoyment of the show to their opinion of this film as well. But this kind of comedy does nothing for me, so when I was watching South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut instead of enjoying myself I was mostly bored. It was kind of shocking to see the movie was only 80 minutes long, because I kept thinking it was dragging on too long, like a 30-minute episode of their show spread thin into a feature film.

Wow glad I finally got around to finishing this
Funny and annoying, the songs become exhaustive near the end.
Probably the only movie that makes Brian Boitano a hero, and deservedly so.
By far and none one of the best original movie musicals ever made.
Shut your fucking Face uncle fucker!!!
this has the best villain song of any film of the 90s; get your be prepared and hellfire outta here; this has clearly the best villain song. also this is unironically my favorite animated film now and i have no shame in saying that
The only movie worthy of a perfect 5/5. And that’s the truth. For those who don’t know, I am like the biggest South Park fan you’ll ever meet. I still remember the day I discovered it while channel surfing when I was little and all of a sudden I saw this weird looking cartoon talking about ginger kids. Good times.
Hilarious. Great musical.
Cartman: "All those times I said you were a big dumb Jew? I didn't mean it. You're not a Jew." Kyle: "Yes, I am! I am a Jew, Cartman!" Catman: "No, no Kyle. Don't be so hard on yourself."
Parker and Stone go against the grain by making a movie better than almost anything in the show, with satire that’s oddly on point coming from a couple of libertarian jagoffs.
Fond memories of begging my mum for the dvd, outside hmv.
Mocking Disney and musicals before Shrek ever did, "South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut" offers a fun and rumbustious good time for even those who have yet to seen the TV series.
Fuck. Asshole. Bitch. Motherfuckers and Shit. It's holyshit to watch this movie because it's FUCKIN HELL
I haven’t watched south park tv series previously. But this movie is such a hilarious comedy, ridiculous musical, sharp satire and absolutely brilliant.
It's a better musical than La La Land. Is that what the kids call a "hot take"? 😛
R등급 코미디의 쾌감이란 이런것! The pleasure of R-rated comedy is just like that!
Hilarious jokes, a great service to fans of the show, and incredible music that manages to be catchy, memorable, witty, and actually delievers a message! Fuck Phil Collins, this should have gotten the Oscar.
This movie is good. But I think fans of the show could agree that South Park gets funnier, more socially relevant and more ridiculous than this. They should've waited a few years to make a South Park movie, when the show really got awesome. So if you think this movie kicks ass, you have to go watch the show. It's sweet
60 minutes too long.  The first 20 minutes are great, the commentary on censorship is great, and the last 10 minutes are fine.  I couldn’t have cared less about the rest.  All the songs after Blame Canada really annoyed me.  I feel like I did when I watched the Matrix for the first time in like 2015. It doesn’t seem that great because it’s been done a lot, but if I had watched it when it came out I would have been impressed more. I understand that watching this in 1999 must have been wild, it was definitely pushing the envelope, but in 2018 it’s nothing we haven’t seen before.
it’s frickin’ hilarious dude so it’s just enjoyable at that, but like there’s also cool themes of censorship that are intelligent. so like it’s stupid funny and smart metaphor
“Over To The movies we shall go, where we learn everything that we know, cause the movies teach us what our parents don’t have time to say” The fact that they made a South Park film and decided to make it a musical is just, a brilliant choice
This movie has no right to be as good as it is. Someone adapt it as a Broadway stage musical RIGHT NOW please.
Yet again... I just think this movie's the bees knees in so many respects. Aside from packing in a substantial plethora of sight gags and jokes that span a sizable spectrum of maturity, Parker and Stone display expert comprehension of the musical form, exemplified by a stunningly smooth medley of six previously showcased songs sung by six groups of characters, perfectly placed to set the stage for the final act. The satire is far reaching and hilarious, jabbing at South Park's rudimentary animation, the MPAA and censorship, the sociological/cultural dangers ironically imposed by overprotective parenting, racism within the U.S. armed forces, the ridiculousness of the entertainment industry, etc. That Satan, depicted as a card-carrying homosexual, isn't the story's big bad -- the dishonor goes to revived spirit of Saddam Hussein -- is a subtle yet remarkable positioning, one which indicates hate and intolerance as forces far more sinister and detrimental than any peaceful identity (regardless of crudity, as in the case of Terrance and Phillip, who stand in as representatives of South Park's status in pop culture). With: Drew Bierle Where: Condo living room TV
I haven't seen much of the show but from what I've seen, I feel the same about this; I just don't get the appeal. Yes there is some clever and satirical writing but it's all bastardized by the crude animation, grating voice work and aggressively low brow sense of humour. The whole experience Is like watching an obscenely extended version of an early new grounds cartoon.
Debated between 3.5* and 4* but the raunchiness, coupled with a musical, can get me to 4* on originality, if nothing else. Much of the satire is still just as relevant and clever almost 20 yrs later.
This is a comedy masterpiece don't @ me
A classic pure and simple, South Park at its best.
I Like It I Joy It
I wasn't allowed to watch South Park in middle school so I memorized the script to this movie and played it over in my head
Remember what the MPAA says; Horrific, Deplorable violence is okay, as long as people don't say any naughty words!   I don’t know what this says about me and my taste but this is probably my favorite musical. It’s made the very prestigious list of musicals I actually like. This list includes, this, Monty Pythons’ Meaning of Life, and La La Land. I would add Jersey Boys but that’s more of a biopic. I’m sure my choices are unconventional but I don’t typically enjoy musicals. Anyway, I was already a huge fan of the show but I still hadn’t seen this until today. I really just enjoyed the hell out of this.
Funnier than I thought it would be considering I don’t really give a shit about South Park.
There's an indelibly cathartic quality to the film once the boys hear the obscene melody in the movie theatre and begin adapting its profanity into their everyday language. Team America: World Police as far as I am concerned is a bad film, and I am not a fan of the series this film follows whatsoever, and so my level of enjoyment came as quite a surprise. For the entirety of the first hour, this film is honestly strong in its songs and satire. Exposing the absurdity of censorship is the crux of the film, and its metatextual narrative is not shy of revealing its political intentions. It was working quite well for me; it got me thinking just as much as it humored me and put a smile on my face. It's just that in its last twenty or so minutes that its politics become more muddled, its jokes begin falling flat, and even the songs become less inspired. Case in point, I found the song that is sung by the Big Gay Al to be completely out of place, as do I the personified clitoris, the edgy resistance kid, and definitely the majority of the end fight sequence. These are jokes that had set-up but no logical leap to them as conclusions. It's a shame that it loses its way because I was really with it at first. I can't say I agree with its politics either. The MPAA is a flawed system, one that is extremely problematic in a variety of ways, but the core intentions behind it, as far as I know, come from a good place. I suppose I like more room for interpretation and analysis in my satire. There are many opportunities that this film missed, but still, the first big chunk of it is highly entertaining. It's far better than the garbage that is Team America at least.
Every single South Park episode is like marmite to me and this is clearly on the bad side of that. Not enough Butters.
I LOVE SOUTH PARK BEST MOVIE EVER 11/10. -/M
I must admit I've only seen a handful of South Park episodes. However what I've seen of the show I rather like and find hilarious. I was rather curious to watch the movie and I quite enjoyed it. The movie is hilarious from beginning to end. I also like how it parodies the Disney renaissance films being full of some really catchy and creative songs. Though probably my favorite parts of the movie where the scenes with Satan and Saddam Hussein in a homosexual relationship which had me dieing of laughter. In the end South Park: Bigger Longer and Uncut is really funny and I think you will enjoy it even if you aren't a big fan of the show. Just don't show it to your children or the easily offended.
A fun musical for the whole family! :)
Will somebody please think of the children? Being commonly referred as the year that changed movies, it's only fitting that 1999 hasn't lost its historical significance on the field of animation. The year saw the release of Disney's official last animated feature from the 'Renaissance' era, making a successful torch-passing to Pixar animation with the great "Toy Story 2". Although there is a natural propensity to label "Tarzan" the last classic animated film, in my humble opinion, this honor goes to the contender, the unexpected newcomer that blew me away, as a movie viewer, the movie adapted from a 2-year old TV series: "South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut". The most remarkable achievement of "South Park" is its perfect combination between a classic approach to the genre of animation with all the elements that forged the series' controversial reputation, and I'm not only referring to its use of vulgar humor and profanity but also its satirical treatment of timely issues, at a time where "The Simpsons" was starting to show a slight decline of quality. "South Park" feels like a two-part episode but with nothing to envy from Disney classic films, the plot is coherent, the film takes us in one of these unexpected climaxes like only the show has the secret, and I'll be damned if the film doesn't feature the greatest set of songs since "Aladdin". The songs deserve a whole chapter. The first time I saw "South Park", I didn't see them coming, it starts with what I thought was a cute homage to "Beauty and the Beast" with "Another Quiet Sunday Morning in my Quiet Mountain Town", a sympathetic way to introduce to all the characters (not everyone is familiar with the show after all). Then, the story takes off when the leading quarter Stan, Kyle (and his cute brother Ike) Kenny and Cartman go to the theater to watch the movie version of Terrence and Phillip, featuring the outrageous song with the titular F-verb involving a family member not to mention a very creative use of fart as musical accompaniments. Naturally, there is an uproar following the film's release, "South Park" prudish inhabitants, mostly mothers, lead by the dominant and hot-tempered Sheila Broflovski condemn the use of profanity, the vulg .wait, didn't I say that before? You got it, it's a self-referential plot where the creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone anticipate the reception of their own movies, something that can be summed up in a catchphrase belonging to the rival series: "will somebody please think of the children" The mothers form an association in order to protect children and since Terrence and Phillip are Canadian, they don't blame the government, nor society, nor the images of TV, they blame Canada! And right now, I have the "Canada" march in my ears and without a doubt the song of the year (played during the Academy Awards' Ceremony) "Blame Canada", the only one to be nominated for an Oscar, which is a shame, because there was at least 2 other titles to include. Indeed, "What would Brian Boitano Do?" would have been a great second choice, an example of great writing, catchy music and surrealistic fun. If "The Lion King" had three Oscar-nominated songs, I don't see why, "South Park" didn't get the same respect. What would a good juror do? Blame the Academy! The plot goes on and on and leads to one of these spectacularly cataclysmic twisted twists we never see coming when we watch "South Park", resolving a question many would have in mind. Indeed, I've often wondered why it took 17 years for the most successful TV sitcom of all-time "The Simpsons" to have its movie while "South Park" was still recent in mind, hell, even Butters wasn't a major player and Mr Garrison was still a man sadly, even Mary Kay Bergman, pretty much all the female voices in the film was still alive (Rest in Peace to one of the most talented female voices ever whose sudden suicide is the only veil of darkness on the film's shining legacy) Anyway, I guess the fans will know why the show made a movie so early "South Park" plots often start with an ordinary issue and takes inevitably dramatic proportions flirting with fantasy and surreal humor, it's satire to the extreme. This is why it's not surprising that the last act features a war between America and Canada, Stan's quest of Wendy's Heart and the mystery of the G-spot, and an unexpected cameo from the devil himself and his lover Saddam Hussein well, I understand the makers won't have a soft spot for the late dictator but I give them the benefit of the doubt, this was pre-11 September era (as if it ever meant something) and not all the members are Hitler-like figures. But the inclusion of hell is a good plot device as it allows one character to be still preeminent even after his death, you know who I'm thinking of, the one that got killed every episode because of some bastards' move. "South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut" is everything a film can be : an adventure movie, a satire, a coming-of-age story, a fantasy and more than anything, a great musical, this is Golden Globe, what I'm saying, Broadway material and I hope some producers will think of an adaptation, and I'm only half-joking. Witty, intelligent, subversive, the film is perfect to the point it even questions its own criticism through the very plot it features, not "The Simpsons : Movie", no classic Disney film ever achieved this. And for that achievement, I applaud the film, and me I don't applaud for not getting immediately the joke behind the title.
Saddam and Satan being gay lovers?! You already know this film is good. It's hilarious and definitely a must watch.
"South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut" is a masterpiece. Not only is this the funniest, most offensive film to date, but it's also the most important. The plot blends perfectly with the tv show's style, and so does the animation. The characters are all iconic and hilarious. The songs are unforgettable and works of art. But most importantly, this movie has a message to it: don't blame tv shows for your bad parenting. All parents should see this and learn to take personal responsibility for their actions. "South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut" is funny, has great characters, has perfect animation and writing, has amazing songs, and has an important message. This is my favorite movie of all time, and I highly recommend you watch it, and learn the appeal!
Still the best musical around.
One of the cleverest comedies ever made in my opinion, only deducting half a star because it’s a pretty ugly film (especially the scenes in hell).
To date, still my favorite portrayal of Satan in any media (though Care Bears 2 comes close). He's hilarious and gets what is by far the best song in the movie (sorry Brian Boitano). The message about hypocritical censorship is hilariously blunt, and the songs are surprisingly memorable, given how short and goofy they all are. Every significant character gets their moment, but none feel particularly dragged out (though the Clitoris subplot is a little forced and not particularly enjoyable). It's just a really, really funny movie.
This movie has seeped into my brain, forever permeating my subconsciouswith one-liners and some of my favorite musical numbers. There is never not a good time for South Park.
Just as vital and as funny as when I saw it on first release...
This is best movie based on an animated series. I can rewatch it so many times just for the songs alone. It’s just flat out amazing.
Has anyone else used “Barbra Streisand” as a curse word besides Eric Cartman?
Its not often that a movie makes me bust a gut laughing almost 20 years ago then makes me laugh the same way almost 20 years later. I got this movie free as a person who loves and owns as much movies as I do was giving away her movies I picked this one up. It is awkward how this can almost reflect American/Canadian relations right now in a way. I love South Park yet i never get to watch as much as I want but when I do I am always laugh, this movie is no different.
So effective because it’s so angry. While a typical episode may reach across the aisle to deliver a beat down of both sides of an issue, this a rare occasion that refreshingly defines the right and the wrong. It’s as if Parker and Stone wrote it with the prescient knowledge that the MPAA were going to be their number one enemies in the real world.  And what writing this is! I have my qualms with South Park’s indulgence in Cartman-isms, but thankfully his Jew-hating, mini-Hitler alter ego is almost non-existent. The movie makes great use of its cast and really pushes them in honest ways. Not a single subplot is unnecessary or wasted, either. This is a razor-sharp script, honed by writing seasons-worth of 21-minute episodes. Every hallmark of South Park you can find here pulls out the stops on the film, and really delivers a rousing, hilarious, insightfully crude time. If you only watch one thing South Park in your life, it has to be this. It’s a perfect distillation of the show’s icon, power, and impact.  And how about that music? The South Park team are some of the most gifted song writers in entertainment today. Change my mind.
obscenity in its most artful form.
I can see why people think it’s so good but none of it works for me.
This film is one of the greatest of the 20th century. It is absolutely hilarious while also developing a half decent plot. It features a beautiful score with songs like “Uncle Fucker” and “Kyle’s Mom is a Big Fat Bitch.” This is a beautiful yet hilarious film and one of the few I will consistently rewatch.
This is another review going into odd experiences of nostalgia, but I might as well review this somewhat, since it's not terrible. The South Park movie is far from a bad movie. Hell, I can easily see how some people love it. Why, because when I first watched it, I thoroughly enjoyed it. However, much time has passed, and I'm not too into the edgy humor of the long-running series any more. I can still respect some of what it does, and can still at times be very witty, but comes off as too crass at times. The film is some of its best, with some enjoyable humor, and for how much I enjoyed it when I was into edgy humor, I can clearly see how people can enjoy this film. I don't really have much else to say about this, so onward to the nostalgia portion of this review. At the time of watching this, I wasn't exactly in a great place in life. I was currently living in a hotel due to a house fire. I had broken my wrist, and my dominant one at that. During this period, I remember watching this, late at night in the living area of the hotel room. It's always interesting when you can tie stuff like this to very specific time periods and places in your life. I'm not quite sure why I'm writing about my life experiences during my watching of the South Park movie at 3 AM while I'm supposed to be finishing up homework, but I think I'm dying, so there's that.
I accidentally clicked play on Amazon Prime and couldn't find the will to stop it. I love this film.
Funny and inspired. Good jokes. Ridiculous. Very socially aware. Seems very inspired by Les Mis too, which is always a good thing.
Other People: "We've been skating all morning and laughing and talking of memories passed." Me: "I saw the South Park movie." Other people: "Awh-huwh..." Try not to pigeonhole this film by its superficialities. Most movies are terrible because they hide behind their supposed "subtleties". Clever and subtle can be all well and good, but I find the experience more enjoyable when the content is thrown in your face (with show tunes no less; which I rarely find enjoyable).   This is simply brilliant.
Part of my love for this is nostalgic—I remember watching this stoned with friends at university and screaming with laughter at Satan’s key change—but I’m also genuinely convinced this is one of the great satires of the late 20th century; a brilliantly profane assault on American hypocrisy which takes aim at censorship, religion, war and so much more, all bolstered by musical numbers that have no right to be as good as they are.
Not my cup of tea, but still an important film in the history of animated films. Has a lot to say about censorship in movies today.
The best musical ever made.
It's hard to imagine a time when South Park wasn't the never-ending goliath it is now but back in 1999 the show was still in its infancy. A mere 2 years or so into its run in fact, and yet the show had amassed such popularity in such a short span of time that it allowed its two creators, Trey Parker and Matt Stone, to develop their own full length feature film adapted from their hugely successful animated series. The end result was South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut which turned out to be exactly as advertised and more. The movie came out when I was 10 years old and unlike the boys in South Park I didn't have a hobo that I could bribe to help me sneak into an R rated movies and there was no way in hell my parents were going to take me to see this thing which is ironic since it sort of mirrors the actual plot of the film in many ways. Now, by the time the film finally came out on home video I had already sort of gotten over my little South Park phase and had by then moved on to other things and so I never got around to actually watching the film... until now. Was it worth the wait? Turns out I may have been better off watching the film back when it first came out because there are certain aspects of it which haven't aged particularly well now that we're nearly 20 years removed from it. It just seems like one of those "you had to be there" sort of film's. Mind you, the film is not without its charms, I just don't think it holds nearly as much power now as it did 19 years ago. Making the film a musical was certainly an inspired choice that allowed Stone and Parker in particular to really exorcise their love for the big Hollywood movie musicals of days gone by. Over the years, many of the film's songs have had their own little niche within the pop culture landscape such as "Blame Canada" and the now infamous "Uncle Fucka". These songs and others like "It's Easy, MMMKay" and "Hell Isn’t Good" are gems that are as infectious now as they were back when they first exploded into popular consciousness. Others like "I'm Super" as sung by the character of Big Gay Al or "I Can Change" by Saddam Hussein either never really got off the ground or failed completely to stick their landing. What with the somewhat up and down quality of the film's musical output, it's fitting then that the jokes featured in the film share the same somewhat frustrating inconsistency. The ones that do find their target end up killing while those that don't end up landing with a pretty resounding thud. In certain cases where it's obvious that Parker and Stone have failed to come up with a clever punchline they'll usually try to cover it up by making Cartman or whoever cuss up a storm and that right there is the joke but it's just not all that funny. There's only so much comedy mileage you can get out of making kids swear. There's a specific line there and in trademark South Park irreverent fashion Parker and Stone just sprint right over it and keep on going. It wouldn't be South Park without some biting social commentary and Bigger, Longer & Uncut certainly does not disappoint in that regard. In fact, there are very few targets that are exempt from the duo's mighty wrath but perhaps the one target which gets skewered most of all is the MPAA for its utterly antiquated policies on movie ratings. The film goes to great lengths to try and expose the evils of censorship as well as promote the importance of free speech. It also goes to great lengths to shine a spotlight on the perils of what I like to call "hysterical parenthood". Meaning overzealous parents who go out of their way to point the finger towards anything and everything in an attempt to divert the attention away from their own shortcomings as parents. In the case of Bigger, Longer & Uncut, the parents' adopted target was my own home country of Canada who they lay blame for allegedly having corrupted their children's imaginations through the exposure of their imported comedy duo, Terrance and Phillip. The mob mentality of the parents escalates to a point where the United States of America is on the verge of all-out war with its closest ally and Cartman, Kyle, Stan and Kenny are the only ones capable of putting an end to all the madness through simple use of common sense which is something that seemed to be sorely lacking in society back in those days. Funny how things never change, huh?
SHUT YOUR FUCKING FACE, UNCLE FUCKA!!
watched last night for the first time in forever  by my lonesome and i was crine the whole time. I would hate to make a cartoon post south park because it’s impossible for it to ever be funny, i.e bobs burgers, “rick and morty” & big mouth. Trey Parker perfected it on all aspects. I used to think seth mcfarlane was talented with his musical stuff because he thinks he’s bob hope and sinatra but the songs in this are way funnier than anything he could ever make. and the way Trey Parker parodies america is better than anyone besides the creators of GTA.
A great musical surprising enough 67/100
I really don't know what to think about this one. It could be brilliant or it could be really strange. And I'm going to have to say that this one for me wasn't that good and it really was a waste of time.
this movie shouldn’t be allowed to be this good
Best musical of all time
Hi, we replaced your heart with a baked potato. You have about 5 seconds to live.
“Because the movies teach us what our parents don’t have time to say.” What a like, what a film.
I reviewed this last year- watched on tv again- it is brilliant
Expect nothing more than the humour you get from a normal south park episode, but with the addition of many great songs. Somehow a musical fit the tone of the movie perfectly, but the humour just isn't cutting edge. Philosophically this film is amazing, but not a comedy masterpiece.
Quite possibly the greatest animated musical of all time. You’ll have “Uncle Fucka” stuck in your head for weeks.
Think it is safe to say, this is my favourite musical film.
I honestly do not have too much to say about this movie other than: 1. I never thought I would ever see this movie 2. I also never thought I would ever see THAT much of Saddam Hussein Other than that it is pretty funny; an outrageously offensive time with some great satire about censorship!
The biggest 'Blowing the Fuck Out' moment to the MPAA we will ever get. Helps that it's also a decent musical and a decent comedy in it's own right.
Tarzan bearing this at the Oscars is the worst thing to ever happen to cinema.
I love the show, and I love the movie.  it’s comedy gold, has memorable scenes, all the main characters shined. not to mention the amazing soundtrack! (the only reason why I don’t give it 5/5 is because I watched this with a friend once and now they quote the classroom scene, and sing “kyle’s mom is a bitch” all the time and it’s started to annoy me oof)
Forgot how musical this film is. Parker and Stone manage to make it not feel like 5 episodes sown together and a proper feature that's still hella funny even today.
Everything you could want from a South Park movie and more.
why have I heard most of these songs without seeing true film I’m so confused
I don’t know who Brian boitano is but I love him
South Park: Bigger, Longer, and Uncut is hilariously funny, rude, and wildly good. Trey Parker and Matt Stone do a perfect job in this film, even if the movie can be really rude and offensive, it's still a very funny and hilarious comedy. My daughter is visiting Colorado soon so we had a gd laugh watching this tonight 😁😂🤣 youtu.be/48XreePDi8k
Better than the drawn together movie for sure
My first experience of South Park was exchanging songs from this film with other boys from school over Bluetooth using our terrible phones circa 2006.
Yes, yes I've seen the South Park movie who wants to touch me? I SAID WHO WANTS TO FUCKING TOUCH ME!
If I was into South Park when this movie came out, this would've been a really big deal. It gives a lot of payoffs that are worth it I guess. It's exactly what you'd expect and it's not bad. I just don't know if I'd ever watch it again.
Extremely crude, extremely offensive, and extremely hilarious
This honestly surprised me. I expected a really silly, immature comedy film that'd make me laugh and instead I got just that, but with commentary on censorship, discrimination and war.... and also it's a musical. I honestly didn't expect the musical aspect of this film to be actually well done, but it's a really great musical, with some catchy fun songs sprinkled throughout the film. The commentary is pretty fantasticly done. It's not only well done, relavent commentary on society, media, discrimination and shifting the blame to a generalised group of people , but it also leads to great humour too, without sacrificing the comedy. Speaking of which, this movie is pretty funny. I've never really watched South Park, but the comedy just works in this. It's crass and horrible and slightly offensive, but it's all pulled off and is somewhat self-aware of itself. The pacing was also great in this. This movie lasts just over an hour, but it honestly feels like more because of how fast paced everything is, which isn't a negative.  This movie is just so great. I love it.
Brilliant. Iconic as hell. Stands the test of time. I'll never forget being in the boys' shoes trying to see THIS movie. Life mirrors art and art mirrors life. Highly quotable. Highly SINGABLE! Now, SHUT YOUR FUCKING FACE UNCLE FUCKER AND GO BLAME CANADA! "I'm sorry, I can't help myself. That movie has warped my fragile little mind."
I have never seen an episode of the South Park TV show but I had high hopes for this, given how much I enjoy Parker & Stone's other musical efforts. The music is definitely the best part of this film. Some of these songs are fantastic -- clever lyrics, music that is a perfect parody of various musical styles, and, on the whole, pretty solid jokes. But compared to something like Cannibal!, the jokes are much more sophomoric, and compared to The Book of Mormon, the satire feels extremely aimless. There's a carelessness to this (that I suspect is tonally carried over from the show itself) that not only keeps it from ever really working but frequently gets in the way of the actual jokes. I chuckled a few times, but on the whole I wasn't sold. How it entered my Flickchart: South Park > No Country for Old Men (which really needs to be moved out of the center of my chart) South Park < Baby Driver South Park < The Village South Park < Ghost World South Park > Lolita (1997) South Park < All That Jazz South Park > National Lampoon's Vacation South Park > The Magnificent Ambersons South Park < Wreck-It Ralph South Park > Silent Hill South Park < Crocodile Dundee Final spot: #1265 out of 2775
Always has been and always will be my favourite comedy movie
It's just great to see how much Parker and Stone can get away with that no one else would be able to. Just like in the show the message of this film is never subtle, but it would be unfitting if it was. The MPAA doesn't get railed nearly enough. Beyond the over-the-top humor, this film reaches a level of social commentary that the show didn't in my opinion until the last few seasons. It seems like the duo has really perfected that side of their work, and the impact of the movie is lessened a bit by being overshadowed by some of the newer episodes. Still, when Sadam Hussein breakdances to win back Satan's heart or Cartman summons force lightning by shouting "respect my fucking authoriteh!" what can you really say against it?
Almost 20 years old, yet had the ‘around the world’ segment of ‘Kyle’s Mom’s a Bitch’ been any longer, I’d have ruptured something from laughing so hard.
This movie...this movie is the definition of hilarious. I can understand why some people don't like this movie, it's messed up and gross. In my opinion this is one of the best animated movies. It has a good soundtrack and feels like an extended South Park episode.
I never got around to watching South Park on tv, I still don’t know why, but I’m aware of how brilliant it’s satire is, but I have seen this movie and I love it. It’s a great meta movie with hilarious satire of censorship, the music is surprisingly great, the characters are entertaining, stupid but charming. Really love watching this
This film disappointed me a lot. I expected so much from it as I love both the show and the games of South Park and a movie sounds amazing. But the plot and all the songs just ended up boring me to the point where I just wanted it to finish and couldn’t stand another minute of it.
Love this film
4th time. Saw it first time on the Paramount lot in July 1999. What can you say about 4 kids from a small Colorado town who end up facing the Devil and a dead Saddam Hussein, all because of a little film from Canada? It's freakin' awesome!
just as hilarious as every episode of the show. the musical numbers are phenomenal and really make the film unique. plenty of funny moments but their weren’t any jokes that had me rolling on the floor. let’s get a sequel already!
Ahh, the gold ole days back when Parker and Stone just wrote well thought out juvenile comedy. The funniest South Park has been in the last 20 years.
Definitely one of the best movies based on a TV show. The songs are genuinely great, and the last few seconds of this movie are one of my biggest crying moments in all of film.
One of my favourite animated movies ever. It's absolutely hilarious, has a good story, funny visuals, and catchy songs.
this film is the peak of comedic satire. it’s honestly genius how they make a social statement about the show and it’s impact. it’s by far my favorite musical of all time
This was step 4 in my watch through of all of South Park. I can’t get blame Canada out of my head now.
After 19 years, SOUTH PARK: BIGGER, LONGER AND UNCUT still holds up so wonderfully. What’s most surprising is that it’s a full blown musical, filled with songs that hark back to the Disney Renaissance era but with a decidedly subversive bent. The satire is so sharp but at its core, there is genuine heart. In this film, you can easily see the genesis of their Broadway smash Book Of Mormon.
Pretty damn cool. I'm a huge South Park fan, so this doesn't disappoint. Has everything you would expect from Matt and Trey. This is just great. The only thing that might have this beaten is the game series.
South Park is for me, a show that is hit or miss. Some episodes truly are hysterical and great satire. But some are just dick and fart jokes or too fucking preachy. This movie encompasses all that is good about South Park. Mild dick and fart humor, with great satire and funny jokes and songs. It doesn't get up its own ass with unnecessary messages and just fart for 80 minutes...no it is pretty damned solid.
High quality cinema!!!!!
oh my, i think that's one of best metaphors about freedom, isn't it?
Been a while since watching this. It has some really good parts to it but really just feels like a longer version of an episode. Seems like they relied on some of their signature jokes from the show. Doesn’t feel like you’re watching a special movie or anything. I don’t mind musicals but the one thing I didn’t really like as much was all the songs. It’s still good and what you’d expect from South Park.
Shit faced cockmaster, donkey raping shit eater. Masterfully woven dialogue from a true classic of animation. In all seriousness though, this still makes me laugh and it's still massively entertaining. South Park is the best animated show of all time!! Still like the simpsons and the movie but cmon the simpsons fell of a long long time ago. I don't see any other contenders
one time i farted on the set of blue lagoon
The greatest movie musical ever made
Watching this in a hotel is a decent time so yay
It takes .0001 seconds for me to be back on my south park bullshit and that's done by literally seeing that the sun is shining and the grass is green (under the 3 feet of snow I mean) a day like this it's hard to wear a frooooown, all of the happy people stop to say "Hello!" ("Get out of my way!") even though the temperature's low, it's a perfect Sunday morning in my quiet little mountain toooooown..........
1999 Movielog #58 I'm sure I'd appreciate this movie more now. I'm still watching the show as of 2018 although I rarely watched the first ten seasons when they aired. The film was certainly ambitious and took no prisoners, and was an essential part of Parker and Stone's rise to fame.
I genuinely believe that this is one of the greatest musicals ever made. It's brilliantly funny while proudly conveying a legitimately meaningful message. Deliberate and purposeful silliness when done right is easily one of my favourite concepts within any art and this film is a beautiful example of that.
Funny, with a solid plot and undeniably catchy songs, this movie is one of my favourite, if not the favourite, movie musicals to date. Absolutely the peak of everything South Park-related they have done. I am sincerely glad that this movie was made, and there will always be a special place in my heart for it.
Each time I watch this movie. I laught all the time. The story is really excellent and the gags are unbelivable and cult. Trey Parker and Matt Stone make a miracle to adapt an adult tv show to movie without less the essential and maybe better than the original product. A must for all the people likes stupid story and anim. He too, the music is excellent and he sould was the oscar for the song BLAMA Canada but it’s wasn’t the idea.
[Commentary by Trey Parker, Matt Stone, various staff members & Bill Hader (!)] Matt & Trey are known for mini-commentaries on episodes of South Park, so in order to fill the time for a feature length track, they go out into their production office (where they’re starting Season 13) and grab people that worked on the movie. Then they run out of people that were around during that time, as this is the 10th Anniversary BluRay, so they grab a couple others, including Bill Hader.  He makes any commentary worth listening to. I also had no idea he worked on the show until I heard this commentary for the first time, and now he’s doing more voice work on top of story, since he left SNL.  The best part though is that Matt & Trey shit on the Paramount execs they had to deal with for almost the entire running time. If South Park wasn’t still being released by them (they’re currently doing BluRays of every season), I don’t think this track would’ve been heard.
This is the most nostalgic movie of all time for me.
So politically inappropriate thats its funny but did I laugh out loud ...........no
Coco has all the elements of a perfect film: humor, heart, telenovela twists and visuals I’ll probably never forget. This incredibly vivacious and touching movie about memory, legacy and family made me cry.
Coco is fun and vibrant and surprisingly dark at times. The visuals are gorgeous, there are some great laughs, and a story about acceptance and forgiveness that delves into some grim territory I was not expecting. Also that dog is silly.
I cried like a baby
I don’t care if it’s Disney at its most tear-engineered... I loved everything about this and may never recover.
Exactly what I needed. I know it's old news to say that the animation in this is beautiful, but this time around I was especially struck by the water when Miguel falls into the hole. It's fricking gorgeous.
people who don't like this movie don't deserve rights
Amazing script, gorgeous animation, and great voice acting. Pinnacle of what Pixar is capable of. Please do more like this and never do another Cars.
the best movies of 2017 this and lady bird
Good but by no means a masterpiece; full of troupes and cliches.
when i stop crying i’ll give this a proper review
Watched on new team and wow the colors really shined! Also I’m still a little confused why the Spanish wasn’t the initial dub for the movie but oh well.
I wish I could stop crying.
Well that was fabulous
Meh but fun. I loved the cultural storytelling and music and ofcourse the visuals. But it's a kid movie that is supposedly not enjoyed by adults unlike some animation films.
Can’t wait to hear Shea Serrano shit all over Ernesto de la Douche on VILLAINS
Long overdue. Nice, heartwarming, family animation.
The cutest
Yet another Disney Pixar movie that made me cry my eyes out, I wasn’t okay after this.
can’t stop crying
One of my all time favourite movies from Disney & Pixar. A story about a young kid who all he wants to do is play music and listen to music but for some mysterious reason, it is banned in his household. Day of the dead then comes around and he discovers the other side and has to get back to the living side before he is trapped there forever. Upton his travels, he meets his supposed ancestor who is a famous successful musician who turns out to be a real asshole only for this not to be true and he eventually finds his real great great grandfather or whatever. This film really does a great job of normalizing death for young children and showing them that death is part of life and as long as you always remember them, they will always be with you. Death is such a taboo subject especially in the UK, however this film breaks this barrier and portrays death in a sad, yet warming way as if to shy away from the taboo and show there is nothing scary about it.
A NEW PERSONAL RECORD! Started crying at the 10:35 mark  I would lay down my life for coco, the lady and the film
When it turns out everyone in your family is a good person. 👌
this film is full of life and beautiful colours. every attention to detail was adorable and the music was spectacular.
Coco is another triumph for Pixar, a company that has raised the art of the animated film to new heights with almost every film (almost – we’re looking at you Cars 2 and The Little Dinosaur). A celebration of life set against the Mexican holiday The Day of The Dead, Coco follows Miguel, a little boy in love with music, and his journey to be an individual in a very family-centered existence. A classic hero’s journey, it is bursting with vibrant color and drop-dropping wonder. The animation is simply breathtaking – Coco herself, as an old lady, is an amazing example, as are the lush vistas that make up the land of the dead, with hidden skulls replacing Disney’s hidden Mickeys. When you look from the original Toy Story to Coco, the leaps in the craft are astonishing. When dreck like The Emoji Movie and Boss Baby are dotting theaters, it’s always great to know that the next Pixar film is never too far away. www.flickersinthedark.com
I cry every time
I’ll just defer to Julian Towers on this one; makes me sick to parse a Pixar movie like it’s anything quantitative, to not be a kid anymore (I say, as a barely-technically-an-adult 19 year old) and just enjoy this stuff for what it is. It’s why sentences like, “the Yalomian notion of remembrance constituting a second and final death is interesting, but ultimately only sees play as yet another Disney time-limit Macguffin” get cut from the initial review so that I can venomously place them here, hoping that they’ll coagulate into some form of ironic thesis. Still had a really good time with this though. I like the colors, and the “Remember Me” song.
This is one of the best Disney Pixar films imho. Loved the vibrant colors in the Land of the Dead. It makes me emotional because Coco has an uncanny resemblance to my own grandmother and I'm extremely close to her. So when Miguel sings to her it gets me everytime. 10/10
this movie was sweet and the music was beautiful
I thought it was good but perhaps I came in with too lofty of expectations since critics and audiences alike seem to have put the film on a skyscraper of a pedestal. The vocal performances are good and the animation is perhaps the best and most colorful of Pixar's to date, and the music is very good, I just didn't feel the same connection to it that everybody else seems to have. Good movie, but not Pixar's best.
This is something that Inside Out should've done, embraced it's world, like Coco does. The animation is absolutely beautiful, the ending is heartbreaking, but I still would've liked to see some better development with members of the family.
bf and i woke up singing remember me to eachother 5 STARS
"Coco" is now my son's favorite movie. For sure, it is not the greatest Pixar film but I would judge "Coco" to be in Pixar's upper tier. Miguel loves playing guitar, there is something within him, but he is confronted with his family's multi-generational ban on music. Boy, do they uphold this. So Miguel travels to the after-life to look for his great-great grandfather who was a legendary singer. The after-life is a spectacle to look at: colorful and designed with cities extended into the sky. The focus on family generational legacy is really cool with how both negative and positive decisions can affect the lineage. The ending of the movie is also deeply inspiring and moving. "Coco" is a very good movie.
Got better as it went on with a great finale. #tears
It's hard to put into words how rich this film is in every aspect. From environments to emotion there is so much depth to Coco and it results in probably Pixar's finest film. It's just beautiful. The art and lighting is absolutely spot on and the detail in the background is extraordinary, especially watching it for a second time. The characters are lovable and relatable and the pacing is great - something Pixar doesn't quite hit for me every time. A once in a generation film!
I told my friends I needed to watch a movie that would make me cry and they chose this and BOY DID IT DO ITS JOB
cried so many but in a good way
A well-intentioned movie trying to highlight parts of a specific culture (and does it quite well -- I think?) but unfortunately is like many other movies in another respect -- it doesn't make much sense. Now, I'm not talking about the "living boy enters the spirit world" part, that's all fine. More so, what person would banish something that they love from their life and the lives of all their descendants (to the point where they hate and fear it) because of heartbreak? Why would those descendants do a heel face turn on their generations-long stance on music without really any prompting? Why would someone marrying into this family accept this position so readily? Why would the emotional abuse by the grandmother be just brushed over under the message that "family is the most important thing"? She destroyed the boy's most prized possession and his dreams in a traumatic way! She never even apologizes. Also, why did Hector not disappear when the last person who remembers him died? That should've still happened. Also, the movie was incredibly predictable, sans the one part that was slightly darker than I expected it to be. It's pretty yes, and at least it doesn't make sense in a setting different than the Western lilywhite like other movies, but I still expected better from Pixar.
I was high when I watched this movie.
i loved this so much. so so much.
I can't even begin to express what a beautiful film this was... a wonderfully crafted story with richly developed characters that brought me to tears.
Pixar's ability to emotionally destroy me has reached new heights.
I’m upset now because I’m scared I’ll be forgotten.
Pixar show again they know how to produce a great story and good music. The music felt very much in keeping with the movie rather than simple good pop songs. Highly recommended.
I can’t think of a better film in recent memory that nails the ending this well. still enjoyed this a lot the second time around
I love this movie but literally this is the 100th time I’ve seen it sooooooo it’s getting kinda old. These kids i look after better find a new favorite movie.
It's Just So Good.
A beautiful world realized with the true Pixar craft, I just wish it was quite so predictable.
A very solid animated movie from Pixar with great messages about family. Has one of the most touching endings to an animated film that I’ve seen.
I was originally not going to see this. I thought it wasn’t worth seeing at the time, until it was on Netflix and I decided to give it a try. Amazing. I cried. Maybe cause I’m sentimental? I dunno. It gave me major “The Book of Life” vibes, and I LOVED that movie. Still, I don’t think it’s the best Pixar movie out there. I misjudged it, I’m glad I had a change of heart.
The dog is basically Ed the stupid hyena from Lion King.
pixar has gone and done it again
Loved it! Amazing
Lots of cool stuff happening all over the screen in this movie, the visual gags are incredibly imaginative, and I loved that! It's a bit predictable but yeah, this is a Pixar movie, it isn't the point. The point is to tug at your heartstrings (pun intended) and bring you into an adventure worth telling, and this one definitely is. The whole "you need to remember your family" dynamic was interesting and a great central plot concept. I guess I don't have much else to say except that it was well made! I like movies with musical numbers in them. I like movies with driven protagonists, I like adventure movies, and I like movies that know when to cool down and when to ramp up the excitement, which is, well, this movie in a nutshell. I also like animation movies overall so yeah, right up my alley.
I wouldn't say it's Pixar's best, as it was constantly announced. Plot-wise it's not super original, not a fan of the dialogue either. But the animation is fantastic, and the culture is well represented. And the main song... We all cried whenever it played, of course; it's simple yet so touching. Bright and colorful and great movie.
even though I'm not Mexican and dia de Los muertos is not a real deal in my family but there is a version of it in my Latino country, it was so refreshing and emotional to me see so many things I could culturally relate do Miguel which is literally my grandpa name. it's a beautiful movie, thank you for this.
catch me crying in the club bc of coco  bonus points for me falling in love with Dante, yet another animated animal portrayed as stupid similar to Heihei in Moana
Second time watching it, and it’s still AWESOME!!! How can you hate this film?! (unless you’re an asshole) The culture represented in this film seems wonderful and respectful. I don’t know how close it is to the actual culture, but at least it’s good to know that Pixar is trying to do justice with the Hispanics. The story is certainly aimed at a younger audience, but it’s still a story that all ages can enjoy! I mean, I was crying at the last scene so hard! Voice cast is wonderful and animation is fabulous! 3D animation is definitely Pixar’s trademark, and they keep improving on their game. Probably the amazing part I noticed after watching for the second time, was how the colors were so beautiful and saturated. It was visually mesmerizing with its neon colors. It’s really hard to balance out colors. It especially can be harder when you’re doing it from scratch. But it’s beautiful!!! Watched it again because I wanted to show it to my mom, and she loved it as well! I’m glad I watched it again! In my mind, it’s one of Pixar’s best!!!
One of the most touching, beautiful and powerful of Pixar's films.
Ahhhhh the old hero villain switcheroo. Still, thoroughly enjoyable throughout and slightly more original and refreshing. Pixar will beat out full blown Disney films any day.
I had wanted to see this and kept meaning to see it but it just didn't happen. But then one night I found myself on a plane from New York (where I go to school) to California (where I grew up). I had had to switch flights because of a storm and ended up in business class, something I've never experienced before. To say the least, it was weird. For reference, I'm Mexican-American. I grew up in a middle-class family around other middle-class people. But since I've gone away to school (to a very expensive school with many wealthy students and very few Latinx students), I've become more and more attuned to the behavior of people much more wealthy than myself. I had never been around "rich" people before and I often felt out of place. And so, on that plane, I was feeling like this little poor Mexican weirdo and kept being creepily polite to the flight crew in an attempt to compensate for the rudeness of my fellow passengers. When I feel anxious like I did that night, I try to surround myself with things that make me feel at home. Listening to my favorite music, wearing my favorite t-shirt, etc. My new seat allowed me a meal and I ordered the tamales, although they were the "rich white people" version of tamales. I didn't care that much. And, to accompany my food, I decided to watch Coco. I started crying before the movie even officially started. As soon as the Disney logo sequence played, I was in tears. As I'm sure you know, every Disney film starts with the Disney castle and a rendition of "When You Wish Upon a Star". Coco was the same except this time the song was played by a mariachi band. I was on board with everything Coco would throw at me from that moment on. Coco is not a perfect film, but it is what I needed that night. It made me feel seen and so happy, even when I was crying. And that is enough.
Coco is another great film from the Pixar Renaissance era (not that the films from 2011-2013 were all bad (the only one I haven't seen is Cars 2, which has the lowest RT and Metacritic ratings)). Focusing on the Mexican festival of the Day of the Dead (which Disney were controversially going to trademark but fortunately didn't) and having a protagonist caused people to compare it to the film "The Book of Life", released a few years earlier, but both have been critically praised and enjoy large fanbases. I haven't seen the book of life yet, but I have it on DVD. Now, to recap the story of Coco:In Santa Cecilia, Mexico, a 12 year old boy named Miguel Rivera dreams of becoming a musician. However, as his great-great-grandmother Imelda had her husband leave her (and their daughter Coco) to pursue a musical career and never returned, the Rivera family has banned music for decades and so Miguel practices in secret. The family works as cobblers/shoemakers, but when Miguel discovers that the family maybe related to (i.e. Imelda's husband was) famous musician/actor (and ersatz Elvis) Ernesto de la Cruz, his idol. His family won't accept Miguel's ambition, and he runs away and enters the Día de Los Muertos talent contest. Miguel breaks into Ernesto's mausoleum and takes his guitar, but ends up in the Land of the Dead as a result (invisible to the living). Fortunately, the Calacas (Skeletons) of Miguel's deceased family are there and his stray dog friend Dante can still see him. However, they still dislike music (well, mostly Imelda) and won't let him play music. Miguel meets fellow musician Hector and they go on a journey to meet Ernesto in the afterlife whilst chased by Miguel's family and Imelda's Alebrije (spirit guardian), the cat like dragon Pepita. Making things more complex is Miguel is turning into a calaca and Hector isn't remembered by his family, slowly fading away into non-existence, so they need to get their quickly so Miguel can return home and so Hector's photo can be displayed on an ofrendas so he'll be remembered by his family. Eventually the heroic duo meet up with Ernesto, but it's here where there's a twist in the story. Ernesto is not Miguel's great-great-grandfather, Hector is Miguel's real great-great-grandfather, and when Hector got cold feet and decided to return home to his family, Ernesto poisoned and killed Hector, then stole his music. Ernesto then traps the duo in a pit but they are rescued by the other Riveras. They defeat Hector and reveal the horrible truth about him to the rest of the land of the dead, Imelda now being fine with his musical dream and then Miguel goes home and tells his (living) family the truth, signing a song to make his great-grandmother, Coco, happy. The family finally accepts his musical dream. One year later, Miguel has a new baby sister who he tells all about his family history. Hector is now rightfully the famous one as the pedestal for Ernesto has now been shattered as people found out the truth. Great-Grandmother Coco passed away and she is reunited with her parents as a calaca, and Hector, Imelda and Coco go to visit the Riveras while Miguel plays music to celebrate his family. Coco is a great Disney/Pixar Classic, with a great setting and art aesthetic, likeable characters, great use of music and songs, good messages/morals, fun and playful humour and respect for Mexico's traditions and culture. The Twist Villain thing is starting to get a bit repetitive, but Ernesto's evil plan is more or less complete by the time the story starts so it's a little different in that sense. I'm sure this film will be enjoyed by kids and adults around the world for decades to come!

Damn, I'm not sure if a flick has turned me into a blubbering mess quite like this one. This movie features a great heel turn, fun story, mushy mushy mushy warm cozy family feelings, and beautiful imagery.
when it’s right it’s RIGHT
Much respect and thank to the creative heads behind this.. and you people will be remembered for a good long time for creating such film so you don't need to worry about fading out from the after-life world!!
crying
i haven’t cried this hard at a disney movie since toy story 3
My favorite Pixar movie to date. Great visuals and songs. It did Mexican culture justice and had me crying in the theatre.
This movie brought me to TEARS!! And seeing little Mexican boys dress up as Miguel since this movie came out has been so !!!<3
The plot shortened by me So basically, Miguel's family hates music, but he loves it, so you already know he's going to get into an argument and go to music. • • • The good This movie looks amazing! One of the best looking Pixar films. That, and all the acting is great an believable. This film also almost.. ALMOST, had me in tears. Next thing that was great was the music. I loved the music for this movie! That and the soundtrack, it's so memorable. Lastly, the plot. It was so intriguing and wonderful.. And it had a message at the end. Family always comes first • • • The best scene The ending. Not gonna spoil it, but just the ending. • • • The bad Nothing. This film was incredible. • • • Moms rating 4.5/5
This was so cute. I considered giving this a higher rating but I think it fell a little short in the exposition. This film was interesting because story-wise it doesn't really have many unique elements, however it touches on things that are far more challenging than other Pixar films. This surprised me as Disney typically lives to pander (this was obviously not void of pandering, but it definitely had some elements that I would consider darker than other Disney films). The characters were fun and entertaining (though I did find Miguel could have been a little more dynamic). The films biggest strength is probably how goddamn beautiful it was. The animation, the colours, they really hit home for me. Also, this film pulled on my heartstrings a little more than other Pixar films. Overall a really great film and definitely ranks high in my favourite Pixar films.
The end is so unbelievably heartwarming that I don’t think anyone can be able to speak objectively about the film for a least a week after watching.
I CRIED IN THIS MOVIE AND IM A HEARTLESS BASTARD SUCH A GREAT MOVIE WITH THE BEST CHARACTERS ONE OF MY FAVORITE ANIMATED MOVIES EVER I JUST WANTED TO APPLAUSE IN THE THEATRE WHEN THE CREDITS ROLLED
i just cried harder than i ever have watching this i love mama coco with my whole heart
One day I will watch this movie and not cry.... probably not.
it’s a movie with no flaws
For me the movie started out slow, truthfully though that might have been because of the mood I was in, which was grumpy. However I am super glad I stuck with it because by the end I was in love with the movie. For me the strength of a Pixar movie is that a kid can watch them and enjoy them on a kid’s level, but an adult can watch them on a completely different level, Coco was no exception to this
by now this movie is probably on a lot of watch mojo ‘top 10 movies to watch when u want to cry ur eyes out’ lists
First movie I’ve put off and it was amazing I regret taking such a long time to see it
Defiantly is pixar most underated movies I had a few tears in this movie
I listen to this soundtrack every morning and no one can stop me
Wow This story is so overflowing with love  It is like the only movie I regret not having seen in theaters it’s so visually striking/rich, Fuck a Dunkirk Prob the most comforting existential crisis I’ll ever have
Not a big animation head, but wow this blew me away. I laughed, I cried, I “aww”-ed. So cute and such a good story.
Everything movies( not just animated movies) should be doing to get out of the rut it's in currently. Until the movies start to improve, sweet, well crafted movies like this will do nicely. But it's a sad state of affairs when the best movies are animated kid movies. Oh well, may Pixar continue to put the adult hipster filmmakers to shame with there beautifuly humanist, inspiring movies.
Just as good as everyone has said and more than deserving of all the praise. Easily one of Disney/Pixar’s best by a wide margin.
I mean, it's a fairly standard Pixar affair, but it's also very pretty
hi it's literally been years since I've cried this hard during a movie !!!!!
Coco is beautiful. When the title gains meaning, even more. The ending part can move to tears. But it's not perfect, and the reason is just how predictible it is. Like "oh man, so this guy is ..." and the ending part with "why are you using words, use the fucking guitar!!". And, well, "all's well that ends well", like usual. It's a child(ish) movie afterall. Anyway, as previously said, it's beautiful like all Pixar works. Watch it.
shoot! i wasn’t gonna cry here :/
This is why I'm scared of watching Disney films at the cinema, I always end up a crying mess, especially with the ones about family like this one. Also, how fukn pretty was this? So many colors, it was such a joy to watch.
i’ve seen this movie too many times to count but i cry every god damn time
I enjoyed this movie much more than I expected to, to be honest. One thing that really stuck out to me was how different it felt from other Disney movies—even though it has a fantastical plot, it felt like one of the most real Disney movies I’ve seen. Unlike many of their films, this one didn’t feel formulaic at all; it’s visually pleasing with a touching, original story.
I’m in love with the Coco Among Pixar’s best
'Coco' is such a sweet film. The music is beautiful and 'Remember Me' is a tear-jerker every time it's sung in the film. The animation is stunning as always with Pixar, especially the incredibly well-done intro. Everything looks amazing in the film, all the details are colorful and beautiful. However, 'Coco' is not perfect. The plot is a bit predictable and the rules of the dead are inconsistent or just don't make sense. Although, those flaws don't take away from the vast beauty and emotion of this film. Those flaws are easily overlooked with a movie like this, but they shouldn't go unacknowledged.
Really well done animation and voice acting. The main story is pretty good although the main twist is very obvious from the start. A great kids movie and nothing much after that
catch me openly crying each time i watch this
This is the most beautiful film i’ve ever seen. Mexican culture is so wonderful❤️
Great animation, nice songs, touching story :-D Nice for a cozy night watch
Every boring Disney-movie ever, but in spanish.
Shit had me shook to my core!!!! Tearing tf up!!!!
Is there no limit to Pixar's imagination? This is a beautiful movie in every sense of the word. I wish I'd seen it in Spanish.
The extravagant details on the animation are astounding, and the narrative is interesting enough, even for adults. However, this film doesn't reach the maturity or emotional heights as Up or Toy Story 3 though that seems to be its goal and it looks like I'm in the minority. Maybe it's just that I personally disagree with the central premise; as a childless person I expect to be quickly forgotten but I don't believe that makes my life less worthwhile, so the importance of personal memory and being remembered fell flat to me. I do believe that collective history and tradition is meaningful, and on that end, the film succeeds in literal flying colors.
EU CHOREI TANTO QUE TO DIGITANDO COM AS LÁGRIMAS!
Godamn I think I dehydrated myself from crying.
Correctly. Animated. Guitar. Playing.
A genuine visual, musical, spiritual, philosophical l and, yes, gently political, treat from Pixar. Richly resonant with universal themes of family, loss, mourning, and regret, while maintaining a strong sense of Mexican identity. Bravo.
It's hard not to shed some tears especially when one already has close souls dwelling the land of the dead. Pixar throws here a huge card. But...can someone explain why the dog didn't go mad surrounded by so many bones? :)
Illumination and Sony are QUAKING.
Magnus, you are so great!!
Magnus Carlson is a chess prodigy and the current world champion. I most definitely don't understand the ranking system, but Magnus is listed as the highest ranking chess player of all time: en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_chess_players_by_peak_FIDE_rating. This documentary is fantastic. It starts with home movies of a young Magnus. He's, um, a little different. (ha) And then it continues on to track Magnus' life playing chess as a teenager and then an adult. The analysis of Magnus' approach to chess is really interesting. He's different. He does less rote computer analysis than most players and focuses on a more global, intuitive approach. Also, Magnus is both remote/weird and personable at the same time. We see him distracted and absorbed in thought, but the movie also shows him having fun with his family. It's a wonderful contrast. The ending/crescendo is Magnus' first attempt to win the world chess title. The movie is only 75 minutes long, and it's riveting. Great movie! QOTD That's the most impressive thing I've ever seen. - girl watching Magnus play blind chess at Harvard (and williamt) One of the highlights of the movie is Magnus playing chess against 10 Harvard lawyers simultaneously... while blindfolded! After winning each match, he signs the chess board for each player, except one. One guy asks if Magnus can write down each move of their game on a piece of paper and sign it. So Magnus does it effortlessly, surrounded by a disbelieving group of onlookers. It was breathtaking and absolutely one of the most impressive things I've ever seen as well. Great movie. 5 bill-stars! yow, bill
They don't show any chess
Pretty good documentary, not super technical or detailed, but gives a good overview of Carlsen's journey up until now. Probably best suited for those who may not be familiar with chess, but still watchable for those who are familiar with the game.
Smiled all the way through
When you have children you have certain expectations. Not sharing is usually easier than sharing.
They do well to make chess entertaining as well as interesting and to cover the ground in less than 80 minutes
I fucking love chess and I’m also weirdly attracted to Magnus Carlsen
holy shit this kid’s brain works on an entirely different level from the rest of ours. the movie created a very conventional narrative but like this is mindblowing
Him playing blind at Harvard and memorizing five or more games at once was astonishing?
Truly heartwarming.
Interesting, but wanted more about his training and less about his rock and roll life style.
An inoffensive little doc about the rise of the best player in the world. I’d have appreciated more discussion of Magnus’s playing style. Has inspired me to study more seriously so that’s something.
Hour 15 is a pretty light documentary considering that most of the footage is split between childhood and his first championship. Pacing works and it's a pretty clean documentary overall. Nothing to write home about on a technical level, but it's interesting to see the growth of a bonafide genius at a pivotal moment in his life.
Magnus’ mind is a heck of a subject, but this documentary barely even scratches the surface. To be fair, I’m not sure anyone could get through that impenetrable fortress. But the film is really more about his rise to becoming world champion and the psychological pressure that puts on a mind, especially a teenager’s. What is the personal cost of being a world-class mind in such a formative time in life as your teenage years? How does one cope with introversion and social alienation while simultaneously being burdened with possibly the highest-stakes intellectual contest in the world? How do you continue to perform at a high level when your intuition fails you? And which is the greater intelligence: the ability to memorize all known possible outcomes, or the ability to intuit and create new solutions? I suspect you will not find the answers to those questions here, although the film does certainly raise the questions, which isn’t nothing. It focuses on the journey to world champion narrative more than the champion himself, but it’s nonetheless an engaging story even if it’ll probably only appeal to a niche audience.
Impressive, yet intimidating enough to make me feel like a failure of a chess player.
Very enjoyable documentary that tells a story about raising a child who is different in many ways and using a family to help the child succeed without making demands.
The World Champion is 26 years old, so no wonder this behind-the-scenes documentary runs only 76 minutes. Where's the fire?
A child prodigy story that borders on both the genius as well as the imperfections and struggles of an individual determined to reach his goal. Highly riveting towards the end... makes you want to play that common game of chess!
He wins.
An interesting profile for the uninitiated, but in its cursory understanding of chess, it makes little effort to understand Magnus’s genius, which remains enigmatic as ever. While Magnus the man has had an outsize role in inspiring a new generation of young chess players, Magnus the film fails to depict the game as anything but arcane.

Fascinating story, decently shot. No frills.
excellent documentary...very likable dude. and what an ass that Indian guy comes off as with all of his computers. good villain.
Watching high performing individuals at the top of their game is always an inspiring pleasure. They could be perfectionist sushi chefs, sommeliers or chess prodigies like Magnus Carlsen.
Cool documentary. Well shot. Nothing groundbreaking but I find the subject of high level chess and genius fascinating.
Enjoyable enough story, but doesn't do a great job of explaining what makes his style of chess so good. You simply have to accept the judgments of experts who say things like "he's the Mozart of Chess!" The movie mostly sets up a narrative where Magnus' biggest enemy is his own tendency to crack under pressure, so that the best thing he can do is find ways to relax. They also argue (briefly) he relies on intuition rather than rote memory of good positions. Easy to understand for an outsider like me, but not particularly illuminating.   I learned more about Magnus' style of chess from reading for 15 min online than I did from the film. Magnus has phenomenal stamina. He has an ability to choose unconventional positions with many possibilities for mistakes by his opponents, and then capitalizes on those errors. He himself plays with very few flaws...
It could use 10 -15 more minutes because the bast parts play over the credits. Perhaps it is better if you go into to it knowing nothing about Magnus beforehand.
Who is he? A ghost in his own right. There only in instances And the happenstance of folly. Glory be not that which is praised. Whose kingdom a mall And his crown strung with grease. Whose army will vanquish In the blink of an eye. The mob befuddled. For everything they know Is trampled and defied. And the mob grows angry At his utter lack of care. Who is he? A ghost in his own right. There only in instances And the happenstance of folly. Glory be not that which is praised.  imgur.com/a/zem6K
Good look at a singular mind that has become the best chess player ever. It's surface level stuff mainly, but overall is pretty interesting.
Sadly revealing, that for being a world champion in chess you need to have no other life - and therefore there isn't that much interesting background info about a person without a background. And his father seems to be really pushing...
If Forrest Gump was Norwegian, middle class, and played chess instead of ping pong. I always wanted to learn to play chess, so I find it fascinating. This film could have done more to delve into Magnus as a person, but instead thickens the cloud of mystery already surrounding him.
An inspiring and magnificent documentary about Magnus Carlsen - the best chess player of our time.
yea, pretty good i guess.
This was an inspirational and feel good documentary, albeit a very superficial and cursory one. What impressed me the most was Magnus's luck in having a father who recognized and nurtured his talent from a young age and a close, loving, supportive family. The documentary briefly touched on Magnus's negative experience at school and I wanted to see more along those lines, as well as a deeper examination of his unique talent and mind. The blindfolded chess match against ten masters at the same time was unbelievable.
Magnus is a fascinating documentary which uses unprecedented access to paint a compelling portrait of a fascinating character and undoubted genius. www.backseatmafia.com/film-review-magnus/
king of chess -- but unfortunately this documentary was too surface-level. it DID pique my curiosity, but i finished the film with more questions than answers
A subject as fascinating as Carlsen and a canvas as infinitely rich as chess wasted on an average, linear, generic portrayal. The boy genius shows early prowess, gets the jitters, eventually triumphs. The end. Seeing family footage of young Carlsen is fun to a point, but as a documentary, this has all the insight and depth of a corporate first-day training video and as much tension between different perspectives as a mom's narration over of a photo album. I don't see why anyone who does not play chess would get into it after seeing this movie and I don't see what a chess person would get from it. Enjoy his cameo on the Simpsons instead: www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZiPeqXKC3Y
Like Dancer, this is a fascinating portrait of someone doing what it seems they were born to do. I know little about chess but really this is more of a character study with chess as the focus. This is made in such a way that I feel anyone would find it interesting regardless of their knowledge of competitive chess.
Magnus Carlsen is my favorite contemporary chess player so I went into this doc already primed to like it. What I didn't expect was such a warm portrait of the world champion. Unfortunately, it was at the cost of any details about Magnus the chess player (like, what he does that makes him so good). The final match featured here against Viswanathan Anand framed everything the filmmakers were going for: man vs machine. Computer prep vs. "just playing chess." Using voiceovers from his father to fill in details of his biography, the film tells the story of a boy who kept to himself, tenderly doting on matters of thought until one day he conquered his self-doubt and just played chess. It is a reasonable story (though maybe a little problematic with the way it sketched out Anand) and told in a clean and very well structured manner. The result is a tense match between Anand and Carlsen. It also meant there is no mention of the game they are actually playing beyond phrases like, "he's the Mozart of chess" or my favorite "it is like climbing mount Everest in tennis shoes with no oxygen -- impossible, and yet, here he is doing it." I'm not sure why filmmakers (and people generally) like movies about chess despite the fact that these movies usually avoid chess altogether. Take the awful AWFUL Pawn Sacrifice by Edward Zwick... Fischer/Spassky game 6 is featured (one of the most beautiful games in the history of chess) and yet, nothing of the game is conveyed. A viewer unfamiliar with the game wouldn't even know the opening used (or that chess has an opening at all). The same is true in this documentary. I can't fault a film for not including something it never intended to include, and for the casual viewer I think the film does an excellent job of filling out just who Magnus Carlsen is as a person and what he has accomplished. That said, I really wish we could get a film that found a way to feature the actual game of chess itself in an accessible way. Searching for Bobby Fischer did a pretty solid job of that - the climactic match in that film was fantastic. Magnus seems like a really nice guy and it's really easy to root for him to win all the things but if you dig a little deeper and get a chance to see what he actually does as a chess player you will find a larger picture of the man -- aggressive, creative, and able to win with just the slightest toehold of an advantage.
Good documentary just imagine being the greatest at anything in the world 🌎 and chess of all things Amazing mind..
Watchable but conventional bio-doc about chess champion Magnus Carlsen. I watched because I've been very interested in competitive chess recently (more specifically, the stories behind the great players), but I don't feel I've gotten to know Magnus too well, or understand his importance; it's not intimate or nuanced enough for that, sticking mainly to light hagiography. A lot of the editing feels like a missed opportunity, especially the scene showing that, during his 2013 world championship bout against Viswanathan Anand, Magnus was almost late for a match - and therefore almost disqualified. Rushed and anticlimactic, the scene feels manufactured to create false drama, but could've packed more of a punch had it better explored why Magnus was running late, and the significance of that moment. Also mostly fails to make the actual chess scenes interesting; I feel that understanding of the game, and the expression of its power, is central to making a film like this work.
Pretty straight-forward portrait of an amazing analytical mind. He's not your father's chess prodigy.
wanted to watch something to fall asleep but ended up staying up watching the whole thing lol
Fairly standard documentary in terms of structure but numerous home videos of a young Carlsen and strong narration from his father give some interesting insight into the rise of the current World Champion.
Crown me.
Perhaps not the most accessible documentary ever made however, I still thoroughly enjoyed the tale of Magnus Carlsen and his rise through the chess world. I think for many the thought of watching a documentary about chess would be a turn off and to be honest the film doesn't exactly go out of it's way to fight that. Often there are very detailed descriptions of chess moves that went over my head, or there were scenes of chess matches where the commentators would be talking about moves and to those not in the know (like me) this would mean nothing. It was almost as if the filmmakers presumed everyone knew about chess before sitting down to watch this, or they simply didn't care if you did or not. Yet despite these issues I still found myself getting wrapped up in Magnus' story and willing him on to do well and caring about how he was coping with the pressure.
A celebration of a chess genius. Nothing more, nothing less.
If I ever want to assimilate to Norwegian culture, I have to keep up with their claims to fame.
There is certainly the raw material here for a compelling documentary film. Director Benjamin Ree gets great access to the family archive and the footage of Magnus as a child is interesting, providing a glimpse at the kind of person who ultimately masters one of the most complicated games on the planet. Once this has been dispensed with, however, Ree’s film lurches forward in time for a linear, unimaginative description of Magnus’ life and career. Despite the early teases, Magnus never delves into the psyche or personality of its title character. We know Magnus is a fantastic chess player, but we don’t know how his head works. One talking head says that it’s as if he can “look into the matrix”, but we’re never quite sure what this means. With a little more attention to what makes Magnus tick beneath the surface and a greater, more detailed explanation of the inner workings of the chess world, this could have been one of the more compelling documentary films of the year. Unfortunately, it finds itself sitting a lot nearer the bottom of the genre pile, with its king trapped only a few moves away from a clear checkmate.
A very warm and honest portrait of a true master ...
Solid sports documentary about chess. Doesn't really pop in a meaningful way but perfectly watchable.
An amazing story of how a little Norwegian boy grew up to be the youngest world chess champion, Magnus, is about Magnus Carlsen whom we see all the way back to when he was a towheaded toddler from a wealth of home movies and with his father's voice-over, the clever dad that intuited how his son's thought process worked and guided him to playing chess at the age of 6. The rest of the movie is a moving story about father and son and Magnus's family, who are his biggest fans and how his mind shapes his personality. An intuitive chess player unlike most others, and seemingly free of psychosis, unlike others -- Magnus slowly makes his way to playing the current world champion in Chennai, India after showing us that he's a true prodigy by staging a number of brilliant chess stunts. The film is as fascinating for the way it follows and documents Magnus's way of dealing with things on his way to championship as it is about the game and the world of professional chess, the loving family that surrounds him and his modest approach to his passion for the game from an early age. It stands as one of the best character studies that's come along in a movie in ages. And he's so charming that it's hard to resist being enchanted by his whole presence.
A wasted opportunity for a very interesting story. No explanation for his performance under pressure and lacked any scrutiny of the role of his father.
As many may know, I've been struggling to watch as many of the 145 documentary features submitted for the Oscars as I can before the deadline for preliminary nominations of November 29. I say struggling, because as great as many of these films are, the real world as shown in recent documentaries is a pretty shitty place. So, it's all the more positive to watch an inspirational upper of a film like Magnus. I guess I live a sheltered life, because I never knew anything before about this "Mozart" of the chess world, an instinctual child prodigy genius that rose to become in 2013 the youngest world chess champion in history at age 23. OK, if you're like me that is a spoiler. However, the film does cover a remarkable span of this boy's life, much of it from his father's reminiscences and a remarkable amount of footage covering Magnus Carlsen's early life and chess playing career (I just discovered that even as I write this review Carlsen is defending his world championship in New York which will finish on his 26th birthday.) The film is structured chronologically as a competition sports story, with highs and lows, but mostly highs. Carlsen is not the most verbal of subjects, and chess is not the most visually interesting of sports (actually the film wastes no time in actually covering the intricacies of the games themselves, just focuses on the psychology of the players.) But, by the very nature of the luck of covering a unique and seemingly unspoiled champion from the start, the resulting film is just a delightful experience.
Pretty solid but no major accolades. Short at 75 mins. Would need a strong campaign for awareness. Director's second film, don't know of the first one.
Review forthcoming in Tabletop Gaming magazine issue 7.
It's more than fine, and wisely sticks to a short run time, because the story itself is rather slim (though good). Magnus is a good lead character, as he continues to reveal his complexity to us.
Wonderful engaging documentary about the world chess champion - his intuitive (vs the usual purely disciplined) approach, his humanness, and his wonderful family who so wholeheartedly loves his uniqueness and keeps him grounded.
What do we learn from this? Don't get dickmatised. Don't get married without a prenup. Record everything. Learn to fake being injured/dick/tired. Practise running in high heels.
90% of this is Joan Crawford just looking around the room wide eyed and it's great
Sudden Fear is a classic “I think my husband is trying to kill me” melodrama starring Joan Crawford as a wealthy playwright who marries an aspiring actor (Jack Palance) whose greatest role is convincing her that he’s the perfect man. What makes Sudden Fear so good is that it never spends any time mucking around with the “I think my husband might be trying to kill me” stuff. When the dominoes fall, they all fall at once, and it’s a case of “I know my husband is trying to kill me, what do I do now?!?” Sudden Fear starts out slowly, and it’s mostly a case of style over substance, but the second half is so tightly constructed and all the actors are so good that it’s hard not to get caught up in the clockwork plotting.
A playwright marries a man only to find out his girlfriend wants to help him kill her to get her inheritance. What follows is an excellent execution of fear and suspence as she works to try and foil their plans. This is one of my favourite Joan Crawford movies. She's a fantastic actress and the way she uses her face and eyes with such fear and emotion in some of the scenes is a credit to her silent film days. Definitely worth checking out, its brilliant.
Viewed in DCP in Cohen Media’s 2016 2K digital restoration at the Seattle Art Museum’s Plestcheeff Auditorium.
Two great actors playing actors who can't let the other know they're acting.
The movie drags in the middle and could use some tightening up overall, but the last 25 minutes make it all worth it.
Lol, I think I was much less into the thriller/ suspense aspects that take hold in the second half. I'm not sure but maybe because contemporary shooting styles and sound design can be so much more sophisticated that earlier movies when trying to ramp up suspense can seem like a raw deal. I actually think many older movies excel when staying quieter or more eloquent, and of course by writing. Otto Preminger's Laura for example; he has a quite characteristic paced style, I really like it in Advise & Consent too. But in another example I tried to watch North By Northwest again recently, and I was amazed at how much I just couldn't connect with the sensibility. But Sudden Fear starts very well for me, I'm not a Crawford superfan but I get the appeal. Cohen Media's restorations and blurays are a treasure as usual though, for another thriller-y one released by them that I'm much more on board with check out Claude Chabrol's Nightcap. With Isabel Huppert, a bunch of rich hot chocolate and a husband who needs his rohypnol. But seriously, have watched it at least twice it's an eloquent film.
The "Sudden Fear" of the title is what Miss Crawford experiences when she discovers that the young actor she has married, (an excellent and Oscar-nominated early performance from Jack Palance), is planning to murder her. David Miller's thriller is both extremely enjoyable and highly implausible with Joan pulling out all the stops and also picking up an Oscar nomination for her trouble. The movie marked something of a late career boost for her and was largely instrumental in launching Palance who clearly had a knack for playing the bad guy. As Mr Palance's partner-in-crime Gloria Grahame seems to be having a lot more fun here than she did in the overrated "The Bad and the Beautiful".
David Miller directs this Oscar-nominated classic film-noir, adapted from the novel of the same name by Edna Sherry, about a woman who accidentally discovers that her husband is plotting to murder her. Following a tumultuous courtship, commended author Myra Hudson (Joan Crawford) ties the knot with Lester Blaine (Jack Palance), a glossy actor she has just sacked from her latest production. Shortly after the honeymoon, Myra eavesdrops Lester and his lover, Irene (Gloria Grahame), coming up with plans to murder the rich playwright for her legacy. Devastated by the exposure, Myra pulls herself together and devises a revenge plan. But will her troubled ideas work? Or will it all end in disaster? Joan Crawford gives a terrific performance – one of the best of her career – playing the role of Myra Hudson, the acclaimed playwright who acts like she is determined to try and defend herself in the best way she possibly can after accidentally overhearing what her husband and his lover plan to do to her. She suits her role really well and makes the most of the time she has on the screen. Elsewhere, Jack Palance is excellent and Gloria Grahame is respectable in their respective roles as Lester Blaine and Irene Neves, Myra’s husband and Lester’s lover who plan to murder Myra so they can get very rich. They both suit their roles well, but Grahame perhaps will be more remembered for her part in The Bad and the Beautiful, which won her an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress. Bruce Bennett, Virginia Huston and Mike Connors play the roles of Steve Kearney, Ann Taylor and Junior Kearney to a fine standard. The direction from Miller is excellent because he allows the facial expressions to be seen to a strong effect throughout, while also keeping a tense atmosphere happening on occasions as well and the script is written to a terrific standard by Lenore J. Coffee and Robert Smith as they make the movie easy to follow. The technical aspects that stand out best in glorious black-and-white are the set, camera and costume, because the set is decent to view throughout; the camera makes very good use of the locations and also captures the tense and dramatic moments really well, which deservedly get the edge-of-the-seat status; the costumes are very nicely designed. The movie managed to win 4 Academy Award nominations: Best Actor (Jack Palance), Best Actress (Joan Crawford), Best Cinematography, Black-and-White (Charles Lang) and Best Costume Design, Black-and-White (Sheila O’Brien) and those nominations were deserved. Joan Crawford also rightly got a Golden Globe nomination for Best Actress – Drama. Overall, Sudden Fear is a film-noir that absolutely deserves to have its classic status. This works really well due to the excellent performances from Joan Crawford and Jack Palance, along with the excellent direction, well written script and technical aspects. One of the best films to have been made in the year of this release.
A real nail-biter this one, with an outstanding performance by Joan Crawford. Who suffers agonies like her? No-one! I do think a whirlwind passion for sinister Jack Palance strains credulity a little, but it’s a great watch. Great photography, especially draws you in with the many close-ups of Crawford and her rollercoaster emotions. And clever use of scenes that she’s imagining when she finds out the truth and also her plans on revenge. We can literally see her mind working overtime. A really tense and splendid ending.
I was well and sufficiently suspensed. Joan’s brows do all the heavy lifting.
Slow, slow burner, suspence pic, that mostly rewards your patience.  Some nice images: shadow of clock hands ticking across Crawford’s terror stricken face, Palance’s wild eyes, lit by a handheld light, searching the dark hilly streets for his lover and prey.
Possibly one of Joan Crawford's best performances as a woman in distress who is immersed in the deepest paranoia. The tension is excellently rendered with David Miller's taut direction and Charles Lang's beautiful black and white photography. Jack Palance is also a standout with his odd physical presence contributing to his strange mix of earnestness and menace.
Is there a word for the subgenre of noir movies about women whose husbands are trying to kill them? Anyway, they're my favorite. Second Joan Crawford movie on my Ranker 100 Project and it becomes clear that I've been sleeping on her completely. I guess I think of myself as being on team Bette, but that's stupid on multiple levels. She's great. There's a scene in this movie where she's frantically searching for something, so she panics while stomping around in strappy heels and a fur coat. It's the best.
That third act is sublime, with wonderfully choreographed sequences of almost unbearable tension that avoid feeling cliché or tired. Love the clock motif, and there are some creative plot decisions—the “twisted” ankle, the  time-table visualization, the wind-up toy, the use of the apartment and streets of San Francisco—as well as some clever subversions, such as the beach house.
Crawford, Palance, and Grahame are all phenomenal.
to be fair, driving in san francisco is never easy
It’s amazing that there’s still a decent amount of suspense in this film with a plot that is very contrived. Joan Crawford and Jack Palance are good in the lead roles, but hardly worth the nominations they both received. This is a beautifully shot film though with great lighting during the final act.
wish i didn't read about this before seeing it because i would've loved the ending much more. the female leads in this could do way better than jack palance and his skeleton face but whatever
damned good leads, lighting, and editing.  especially that third act!  would be great to watch back to back with mildred pierce
Don't mess with Joan, yo. This isn't Doris Day in Midnight Lace; Joan's got some serious resilience chops. Good suspense.
For a moment, I thought I was about to watch Joan Crawford in a completely non terrifying, murderous, or off-putting movie. Boy, was I wrong.
God damn, Joan Crawford is the greatest.
That chase scene... and Joan is especially vulnerable, even more than usual.
Joan in a thriller is my kinda Joan!!
When Joan Crawford is on, she is fucking on! And, incidentally, she's got some fantastic hair in this that just cannot be ignored.
I want to be Myra Hudson
my favorite genre: guys who try to steal an Oscar-winning actress's shit getting fucked up in shadowy expensive locations
I especially like that wonderful scene with the pendulum’s shadow of the ticking clock over Joan Crawford’s dark, intense look, while we see her murder plan step by step carefully visualised: film noir at its best.
Great noir film. Jack Palance, with his ever-grinning face, is fabulous in this (you can see foreshadows of his mob boss face in Batman). A brilliant story of an actor who tricks a genuine spirit into falling in love with him out of revenge for firing him. In the process, she discovers his plan to murder her and take her fortune through an ingenious plot device. So she sets about his ruination, conniving a brilliant plan to murder him and frame his lover. But, because she's a moral person, she discovers she lacks the will to kill him. As a result, all hell breaks loose - her plan spirals out of control and leads to the title's fearful climax. The final 10-15 minutes are really well done - nerve-wracking, exciting, nailbiting. And it has the first noir ending, accidental justice. There is some wonderful camera work with shadows in this film, and some create film techniques, including closeups of Joan Crawford's face when she's having her panic attacks that really sell her scenes in which her fear has gotten the better of her. Great film, highly recommended!
Solid noir thriller. Not without its faults, but well done. Jack Palance is a great menace. Crawford is choice as the aging sweetheart with a penchant for payback. A wealthy playwright, who married for love, discovers her new husband is going to kill her in three days. She hatches a counter-scheme, but something goes wrong. The plot, loaded with twists and turns, thins out by the end. It’s a normal amount of story spread over a lot of time. Though, honestly, not a bad way to spend 1h 50m.
145 YEARS OF CINEMA Nr. / Year: 1952 Country: U.S.A. David Miller directs Joan Crawford in this noir inspired psycho-drama that has a very unusual style for the time, in that it balances hapless romance of the first half of the film with a gender role reversal murder plot in the second half - Jack Palance plays Lester Blaine, a young actor who seduces famous playwrite Myra Hudson (Crawford), who is also incidentally the heiress to a large fortune. Lester's character is a play on the stock 'femme fatale' archetype from film noir, and uses his charm and good looks to manipulate her; the sudden realisation (or "sudden fear", if you will) of Myra's suspicions is framed with a very clever storytelling device - she overhears a recording of his conversation with another woman in her office about their plans to get rid of her. Crawford displays a great talent here, showing off a range of startling emotions in a well directed and quietly intense scene. There are some other disturbing moments as well, like a dream scene where she is killed in different ways; or the scene when she has a fantasy about carrying out her plan for revenge. It's all rather starkly morbid, compared to other films of the time, and really immerses you into the desperate situation this woman is put through. Near the end of the film, some scenes could have been shortened, as I felt they dragged on for too long, but otherwise "Sudden Fear" is a compelling drama, and beautifully scored by composer Elmer Bernstein, and gorgeous photography of Los Angeles by Charles Lang (I think I saw clips of this movie in "Los Angeles Plays Itself" from 2004, but I may be wrong).
"I was just wondering what I'd done to deserve you." Sudden Fear sounded like it could be a good one and it was. It starts off pretty good, but it's one of those that just gets better and better as it goes along. I liked the story and the different directions it went in and it build up tension quite nicely. Joan Crawford is very good in the lead role and Jack Palance and Gloria Grahame provide strong support. I enjoyed this one quite a bit. 7.5/10
Joan Crawford is amazingly good in this. The last chasing scene makes you hold your breath.
Joan Crawford was exceptional and her facial expressions alone deserved an Oscar. Just wish there was more dialogue or even voiceover from Myra in the last third of the film or so. It was challenging at times to follow her motivations and line of thought.
A really smartly written movie that is an interesting take on the spouse trying to kill off their spouse genre. I mean it is a very suspenseful movie and the acting by everyone, in perticular Joan Crawford, is great. I just think a lot of stupid moves were done by Joan’s character in the movie that made this a little disdainful. I mean girl if you’ve planned and started your revenge you can’t backtrack out of it at the last second. I mean everyone got what they deserved in the end and yeah go Joan Crawford and your playwright ass. Also loved the San Francisco location as it made the end of the film especially exciting.
*insert gif of Joan Crawford shooting Jack Palance in the back*
Joan Crawford does fear really good. When she's trying to act romantic or sophisticated or just about anything else, her acting is usually horrible and intolerable. But she has a real flair for fear. There's a long scene where she's hiding in a closet for the longest time, and all you see is her face for about 5 minutes. And she's awesome doing it. It was kind of mesmerizing to me.
Jack Palance is one of those actors who really aged into his looks. As an older actor, he had a distinctive appearance, but as a young man he looked frankly pretty weird! So weird, in fact, that they made a movie about it, called Sudden Fear. Joan Crawford plays a Broadway playwright/heiress who chooses not to cast Jack Palance and his enormous, gleaming face as a romantic lead. Later, he resurfaces in her life and they fall in love! But has Palance really turned a corner, or is it all just a ruse for revenge? Joan Crawford does a better job than this movie probably deserves, and Palance finds himself in the awkward position of being the leading man in a movie about how he isn't leading man material. And it's sort of right!
Interesting but watch only if.... a. You like Joan Crawford. This is a great performance by her. b. You really like film noir. This isn't the best but there are several scenes that will linger with you. Personally, I think the story is worthy of a remake. The writers, IMHO, missed a lot of possibilities for fearful turns.
It hurts my brain to see Jack Palance as anything other than wrinkly.
I enjoy Crawford in her noirs, and this is no different, even if she's more hysteric than strong here... But, like Barbara Stanwyck in 'Sorry, Wrong Number', her histrionics work for me. Add Palance in a creepy but subtle role and Grahame at her slutty best (her voice alone in this movie is enough to drive a man mad), and you got a great ménage à trois. The final half hour or so is sublime and tense (even if the climax is a bit of a cop out), I forgot exactly how suspenseful it is.
Joan acts SO HARD in this movie and I loved it.
Crawford excels as the playwright caught up in Jack Palance and Gloria Grahame's machinations. For a film all about plots and secrets It's pretty clear from the very start exactly how everything is going to break down but Crawford really is excellent throughout, her age and experience deepening the role and bringing out all sorts of extra nuance.
A young Jack Palance Was made of 90 percent Cheekbones. Damn, sister! 1001plus.blogspot.com/2018/05/where-theres-will-i-want-to-be-in-it.html
As if anyone wouldn't be 100% madly and truly in love with Joan Crawford like Gloria is pretty but COME ON
It seems like I'm one of just a few that doesn't seem to like this picture. The story is that Crawford gets involved with wax sculpture Jack Palance but finds out she's been played and plans revenge. For a noir thriller Sudden Fear is quite boring and the scenes that are actually suspenseful are few and far between thanks to the slack pacing and yawn-inducing story. The actors do their best but they can't save this film from crushing mediocrity. Since the film isn't really worth talking about I would like to talk about what I thought about Joan during the film. She gives a good performance and I began to think about her and her rivalry with Bette Davis. It should be obvious that I'm #TeamJoan but I love both actresses. Nobody plays bad quite like Bette Davis but I think Crawford had better range, and since this movie was boring enough I spent most of my time watching her acting. Crawford has more of an expressiveness to her face while Davis has a little more biting delivery with dialogue, I think this may go back to Crawford getting her start in silent films while Davis started in talkies. Just some interesting thoughts I had while watching.
Very fun suspense thriller in which a conniving actor (played by Jack Palance) seduces and marries a successful playwright (Joan Crawford), then schemes with his girlfriend (Gloria Grahame) to kill his new wife. What gives the film its particular sting is that Crawford discovers the plan about halfway through, then spends the second half concocting her own scheme. The way in which those two conflicting plans play out is hugely entertaining, particularly since Palance and Crawford are both great at showing the fraying seams of the performances that their characters are putting on for those around them.
Watched for the Queer Film Challenge 2018 Week 50 - Joan Crawford Very slow burn in this film, not once but twice. When is Palance going to turn into the bad guy? Everything seems like it's going so well, doesn't it? Ah, now we see what's going on, and so does Joan, but what is she going to do about it? The pacing in this film is incredible, and such great foreshadowing as well as false foreshadowing. And once again, San Francisco stands out as the best place to film movies.
I continue to be enthralled by Joan Crawford's abundant talent and magnificent screen presence.
"Why do you look at me like that?" "I was just wondering what I'd done to deserve you."
First of all, I watched this movie because I'm getting ready for Anna Biller's upcoming "Bluebeard" movie: Anna Biller Productions, BLUEBEARD MOVIE (giving her the promo she deserves). I really enjoyed this film! At first, when she started panicking about her husband wanting her dead, I thought "She's definitely not gonna make it, she's gonna die". That's why it really surprised me to see her doing everything to coming out alive and see her accomplishing it. I'm glad I watched this movie, that ending was worth all the sweet tension and the illusion scene was amazing, I'm a big fan of that kind of scenes.
I didn’t breathe once those last 15 minutes
You'll be hard pressed to find a Joan Crawford performance reaching more agitated states of frenzy and overwrought anguish than in Sudden Fear, but the real star of the show is Hollywood top-cinematographer Charles B. Lang Jr who properly elevates chiaroscuro lighting, expressionistic shadow play and the nighttime wet-down of city streets to new heights of artistic excellence in classic Film Noir.
Joanie just about reins-in her OTT-ness, but also is quite subtle at times. Superb thriller. Turned onto it by Anna Biller (again!) talking about it on Switchblade Sisters podcast www.maximumfun.org/switchblade-sisters/switchblade-sisters-episode-8-sudden-fear-anna-biller
Mulholland Drive played straight and behind the scenes. Delightfully old fashioned fun.
Sudden Fear for me was as surprising and yet wonderfully thrilling noir with Crawford who does literally everything in this film to save her life from her wannabe murderous husband and his mistress. The gorgeous cinematography is some of the best I've seen. The darkness being used a lot more prominently than the light to show the dark nature of the film. What a great film with many shocking moments.
In an effort to watch more Joan Crawford movies I suggested that my BF and I watch this on my birthday. I made a good choice with this one, as it's a great movie with Joan in it. Surprisingly her last Best Actress Nomination at the Oscars, which was definitely deserved for the role. Sudden Fear is about a woman whose husband and mistress are out to kill for her for fortune. She stealthy comes up with her own plan in what unfolds in a very suspenseful way. It's the kind of movie that has many twists and turns and you're always wondering what's going to happen next. Don't mess with Joan Crawford.
Film #5 of Scavenger Hunt #34 - January 2018 Task #24 'A film that you expect to be bad, but you really want to see it anyway.' My full list here. I honestly expected Sudden Fear to be a schlocky horror melodrama (mostly based on the poster) and it turned out to be an incredibly well crafted noir thriller. Joanie in that silk scarf ready to kill a man... seriously good cinema. Loved the end sequence in particular, definite Third Man/Mildred Pierce vibes.
It's Joan Crawford vs. Jack Palance. If you need to know more, I don't need to know you. I kind of want to get Joan Crawford's eyes from this movie tattooed on my hands....
the teNSION
Sudden Fear inverts the usual gender roles assigned in traditional noir, scoring a critical and creative success signaling the second coming of Crawford as a star. The plot is taught and intricate, the reveal through technology surely an inspiration for countless plots to come. Palance and Gloria Grahame are perfectly paired as a wicked couple who we cheer against and take utter delight in their ultimate karmic payment. Classic.
She could have just divorced him!!
Continuing my study of noir, I saw "Sudden Fear" last night. In some ways perhaps a little outdated, still as the film develops, you get caught up in the suspence and terror. Learned some new things for my next film. I was surprised how well Jack Palance did on this. Joan Crawford is not everyone's cup of tea but whatever you may think, she is a powerful actress.
this was...... really good.
Saint Joan, suffering.
This film continues to reaffirm my opinion that getting married is a terrible idea because men are awful
Deranged melodramatics color this story of manipulation, exploitation, and vengeance, with Crawford and Palance marvelously baroque evocations of a feminine resilience and the bitter, fragile male ego, their pas de deux a richly theatrical power game that hinges on the conflict between Palance world need pride and Crawford’s heart-broken sense of betrayal. Palance’s barely concealed oily manipulation, his dark eyes gleaming with ulterior motivation, instills the film’s first half with a tragic ill-fatedness as Crawford’s joy and confidence becomes delusional and the prancing seductions of Graham’s weasely temptress twist the knife of betrayal ever further. The turn then, captured by Crawford’s marvelously expressive silent performance in all its historionic agony in an extended scene that sees her bliss collapse into a desolate abyss, comes with a righteous force, a swell of feminine fury and outrage that instills the ensuing plotting with a potent moral ambiguity as Crawford’s sense of justice and need for vengeance crash against her humanity, a tense internal conflict that is only resolved in the film’s closing moments as Crawford, silently expressive, again evokes a tumult of emotions with the evocative power of her grand performance.
Film noir is a genre that I always love visiting, even if I don't that often. This is a great example of film noir, and just an extremely suspenseful movie. Interestingly, the gender dynamic here is somewhat shifted from the norm, where a femme fatale seduces the unwitting protagonist and leads him astray. Here, Joan Crawford, an incredible actress, is a playwright who just so happens to run across the same actor she had previously fired, and then fall in love. We soon discover that his whole plan was to marry her and then quickly ensure her death, in order to gain her fortune she will inherit. One of the reasons I really liked this film was the way that it played with dramatic irony. The husband chooses to kill the protagonist due to his discovery of an old copy of her will, which contains a provision that prevents him from remarrying on her death. In a previous scene, she removed that exact portion of her will. The film still does have a femme fatale, in the form of a secondary antagonist, lover of the husband. But unlike a more traditional film, where the blame lies almost solely on the femme fatale, attacking the woman as the cause of all the problems, the blame is on the husband, and his own leaping to conclusions.
Joan Crawford (Mildred Pierce) stars as a wealthy playwright who falls head over heels with an actor, played by Jack Palance (City Slickers, Ripley's Believe It or Not), and quickly marries him. Trouble ensues, however, when she finds out that the actor's feelings toward her might not be entirely genuine, especially since he is still involved with an old girlfriend, and since he stands to come into a lot of money from her estate in the event of her death. One of my favorite classic actresses, Gloria Grahame (In a Lonely Place, It's a Wonderful Life) is at her sexiest, sleaziest, and slimiest as the husband's old girlfriend. Sudden Fear is one of the better woman-in-distress film noir movies out there, and the final moments in the shadowy alleyways of nighttime San Francisco are brilliant. I assume that most of you who are reading this own the Rolling Stones album, Exile on Main St. The still of Joan Crawford on the album sleeve is taken from Sudden Fear.
Do not fuck with Joan Crawford. I repeat. DO. NOT. FUCK. WITH. JOAN. CRAWFORD. Sudden Fear is a tense Hitchcockian thriller elevated by a performance from the legendary actress that encapsulates what exactly it was that made her a star. Crawford's Myra Hudson is a compelling mix of delicacy and strength; sensitive enough to fall in love but self-assured enough to deal with things when the shit hits the fan. The film begins with a fairly typical noir setup that serves mostly to assemble the pieces and introduce a series of Chekov's guns. Early on you'll notice a certain cinematic polish; like the way light and shadow happen to fall in just so revealing ways on Crawford and Jack Palance (whose impossibly angular face makes him perfect for the role of the film's bluebeard). At this point, Sudden Fear is a good film, but nothing you haven't seen before. It's only after a particular scene partway through involving Myra's dictaphone that the film takes a turn into something sharper. The scene itself requires Crawford to do nothing more than react to a voice for an extended period of time, and she nails this with a verisimilitude and grace that feels entirely natural for the character. From this point on, Sudden Fear becomes a tense machine of gemlike precision, as Myra coldly puts into motion a complex plan that isn't quite revealed to the audience. And watching Myra set her plan into motion is a ton of fun, especially with the mileage David Miller gets out of the varying levels of awareness each character has. But its her initial reaction that marks Myra as such a fascinating character. Early in the film we see her as a softer and warmer woman than her perfectionist devotion to her plays would suggest; willing to be swept away by the idea of love. But when she discovers her betrayal, she doesn't waste time with a teary eyed breakdown, she springs into action to save her own life without a second thought. A lot rides on Crawford's performance, and she delivers flawlessly. A hidden gem of film-noir that deserves to be rediscovered.
Good script, great direction, and flipping amazing acting.
David Miller turns out to be a fine jack of all trades -- he does right by the melodramatic moments (cf. Crawford's silent-movie-worthy shock when she discovers the truth), he makes like a serviceable Hitchcock substitute while setting up various dominos (and one significant misdirect), and the ending sequence features moments that stack up with the best moments in any film noir -- but I really wish he was a master of at least one of them. If I had my druthers, I'd rather he hone his melodramatic chops, so those post-reveal moments between Crawford and Palance really pack a punch (& moments like Crawford's change of heart aren't quite so cartoonish). NB: If this film featured more Gloria Grahame, I'd probably be less critical.
Sudden Fear was the ninth feature film directed by David Miller (who also directed revisionist Western classic 'Lonely Are the Brave'), and it stands out as one of the best film noir releases of all time.  The cinematography by Charles Lang (who shot such iconic pictures as 'Sabrina', 'Some Like it Hot', 'The Magnificent Seven', and 'Charade', as well as some of the finest Westerns ever made --- 'The Man from Laramie', 'Gunfight at the O.K. Corral', and 'How the West Was Won') contains some of the best imagery ever to be put on screen.  His use of shadow and contrast between light and dark execute flawlessly the mood that the noir genre attempts to convey with its visual style.  This comes as no surprise, given Lang's photographic work in such film noir classics as 'Ace in the Hole' and 'The Big Heat'.  Every great cinematographer needs a director to be guided by, and Miller orchestrated his masterpiece with ease.  His pace of storytelling is impeccable, bringing to life the screenplay written by Lenore J. Coffee and Robert Smith, adapting Edna Sherry's novel.           Myra Hudson (played by Joan Crawford with her usual melodramatic theatricality --- which is still effective, but will always look over-the-top when placed beside Gloria Grahame's realistic style) is a successful San Franciscan playwright, who also happens to be the daughter of a wealthy family.  When she disagrees with the casting of a lead actor in her new play, based not on acting ability but his inability to appear romantic, and subsequently has him removed from the show, she appears to make an enemy of the man.  However, after running into him at a train station, she is soon wooed by his charm.           Lester Blaine (played by Jack Palance) is a skilled actor, and Myra, being a writer, has a susceptibility to believing in the ideal and wanting it to be reality.  She is taken in by Blaine's confidence and concentrated interest in her.  The two eventually get married, and all seems to be happily ever after.           But any fan of film noir knows that when the plot's circumstances seem to be that rosy, we're really just waiting for the other shoe to drop.  Things are about to go bad --- we don't know how, we don't know why, but we know that's what's coming.  That's part of the charm of a great noir --- that assured inevitability of forthcoming doom and moral corruption.  These stories reveal human nature for what it is with all its flaws, asking for no excuses and offering no apologies.  We are left as viewers to dissect them as we will.            At their wedding reception, Junior Kearney, a lawyer friend of Myra's, arrives with a woman from New York, Irene Neves (played by Gloria Grahame --- arguably the greatest femme fatale in film noir history --- along with Gene Tierney, Ida Lupino, and Barbara Stanwyck).  Lester seems to have a strange reaction to her arrival, almost as if he knows her.         From here, the story takes shape and truly develops its characters, leading them down psychologically harrowing paths, brought to stunning life by Lang's cinematography.  The film's final sequence is among the best ever.         Film noir, in my opinion, is about choices.  There is no good and evil.  We make the decision to be the way we are.  Genetics may play a part, as well as the environment of our upbringing, but when it all comes down to it, we are making the choice to do that bad thing.  That's why these stories are so interesting.  Sometimes the hero isn't a hero at all, but an anti-hero who's just a little less corrupt than the villain themselves.  'In a Lonely Place' comes to mind.  In 'Sudden Fear', the protagonist finds herself with her back to the wall, forced to defend her life at all costs.  However, she is given a choice whether or not to resort to violent means to bring about that self-protection.         Make the right choice and see this film.
Joan Crawford is unlucky in love, getting married to a craggy-faced Jack Palance. What I liked about this one is that about an hour in she discovers the truth about their marriage, and we get another full hour of her dealing with living with a man who she knows is going to try to kill her.
Long after Joan was the queen of MGM and shortly before she revived her career as the queen of high camp horror she tried her hand at the black and white melodrama, and just like everything else she did, she excelled at it. This is one of my favourite Joan eras, she seems so at ease in these kind of roles, using all of her skills as a movie actress to entertain and win over the audience.  Sudden Fear is very theatrical, thrilling and nice to watch, it may not be up there with Humoresque, Mildred Pierce or Autumn Leaves but for Joan fans there's much to enjoy.
Crawford is so good in this that when the first act blatantly foreshadows (or, in the case of the summer house, head-fakes) all of the cliché shit that's going to happen in the remainder, I just got more excited to see her do it. Fairly underwhelming climax but I loved the build-up. Love those location shots of SF in the 50's, too.
*joan crawford does the bare minimum* w OW invented acting
Can you believe it was someone's job to spray fake sweat on Joan Crawford's forehead? Amazing.
My expectation must have been sky high for this movie, considering it gave Crawford her third & final Oscar nominations. And Jack Palance got one as well, probably for his weird looking face. And the performances are awesome, but the movie itself was a let down. Crawford plays Myra Hudson, an uber successful playwright who fires actor Lester Blaine from her latest production, but soon falls in love with and marries him. Pretty quickly, Lester decides he must kill Myra in order to obtain her considerable fortune before she gives it all away. Myra low key finds out about this plan, and is forced to act alone in order to stay alive during a three day weekend when Lester & his sinister old flame Irene decide that it’s the perfect time to kill her. One of the biggest sins of this movie is that it doesn’t handle suspense very well. It’s 50 minutes into the movie before any inkling of a murder is discussed. Lester’s diabolical behavior never comes through. Maybe by design, but I have to believe he’s somewhat evil if he’s going to kill a lady for money. I don’t understand anything about him, what his goals are, what his past life was like. Enter Irene: a standard femme fatale who hints at something like being a con artist or thief, but still offers the same generalities that Lester does. Who are these people? Why do they want money? Are they married or just FWB? I don’t know. The movie is too concerned with cheap thrills to give me some character meat to chew on. Crawford is good in most of the movie. She’s fine during the love story half, but gets a bit terrible during a few scenes in the murder half. Myra’s initial reaction to hearing an accidental recording of her husband & his lover’s murder plan is to immediately grab the recording, climb a ladder & drop it, shattering her only evidence. Why not just leave it? He clearly doesn’t even notice the machine, and all she has to do is take to the police ASAP. What does she do instead? She concocts a convoluted plan I’m assuming was inspired by her plays writing skills. In some parts, she’s in total control of her environment. She easily manipulates her would-be killers like game pieces. She steals Irene’s house key from Lester & makes a copy. She feigns a sprained ankle to keep from a party. She forges notes for both of them in order to place them in the right locations for her plan to work. In all of that she’s quite calm, and it’s satisfying to watch Crawford do her thing in all those scenes. But suddenly, she inexplicably breaks down. She can’t do it anymore & starts to freak. There’s no real reason for this either. It’s just to manufacture some excitement. Nothing happens after that which is true to character. Everything just goes wild. There were some interesting shots. I loved the scene of Myra showing the audience her itinerary, which gives a more satisfying conclusion to her revenge plot than what actually happens. Instead we get poison, a gun & some sleeping pills all of which never get used. It was less of a noir or Suspicion-style revenge thriller than a showcase of Crawford’s underrated acting skills. Her look in that final scene is chilling. A focused plot could have been filled with those scenes, instead of having them scattered throughout.
SAW: at home in HMB
Slowly making my mother a Crawford stan and this was the latest conquest. Her reaction? "Wow, she does not get credit for her acting nearly enough." PREACH IT, MARCIA!
the tension was built so BEAUTIFULLY and joan crawford is the prettiest crier ever
I rented this on Amazon Prime expecting it not to be a good movie and I was super pleasantly surprised. Joan Crawford is incredible in this.
Melodramatic thriller starring Joan Crawford, who shines as the rich wife who learns her husband and his mistress, aptly played by Jack Palance and the always watchable Gloria Grahame, are out to murder her for her money. Crawford sure knows how to dress for a murder.
Jack Palance's alien cheekbones have never looked more chiselled.
My aesthetic is Joan mentally going through her plan to murder her bastard of a husband and looking great while doing it
Latish Crawford entry in the subgenre of "Someone's trying to kill me and I think it's my husband. Joan Crawford plays an independently wealthy woman and a successful playwright. She has Jack Palance fired from her new play for not having enough sex appeal, but when she meets him on her train home from NYC to San Francisco, she seems to have changed her mind. It's all bliss until she discovers that not only does he have a relationship with Gloria Grahame, but that he and his girlfriend have plans to murder her and get to her money. It's up to her to try and thwart them. If you think about Joan Crawford's career, there were probably four phases. I'd classify this as phase three--it's a serious picture, but there are strong hints of the camp and caricature to come. Crawford's wardrobe is just a little too fabulous; her character is a just a little too mannered; and there are some holes in the script (when she finds out what's going on, there's really no reason that I can see why she doesn't either a) just have her husband tossed out on his ear or b) get in the car and get the hell out of there until she can work at option A). Grahame is decent in this and Jack Palance gives a really nice performance. Both he and Crawford got Oscar nominations for their roles. His is warranted. It's a highly watchable film and the locations are beautiful.
Wow, San Francisco as a city comes out even worse in this film than the homocidal husband (played to perfection by a creepy, then somehow debonair, then creepy again Jack Palance). Its inhabitants are selfish and callous -- even to beautiful older women decked out in minks and jewels! If someone was being chased by a killer and asked me to let them into my house for a second to hide, I'd like to think I wouldn't slam my door in their face!! Relationships are also super strange. This is the line Crawford longs to hear from her lover: “You are all the women in my life. You’re the sister I never had, the mother I’ve almost forgotten, the wife I have always dreamed of." Who wants to fulfill someone's incestuous expectations as a sister-mother?! Joan! (Maybe that line is just to clue us in that Crawford's character is no O'Neill but more of the Clare Boothe Luce "lady writer" who might write a hit but nothing for the ages.) But the direction is brilliant, clever and agile, as it works you up to a fevered pitch of excitement and real fear (at least it did this viewer!) - even when you don't know what's going on for a few minutes when Joan is hatching her intricate revenge plans. No scene or shot seems gratuitous. Lots of close-ups of Joan and she makes the most of them! Maybe this wasn't supposed to be funny -- but I thought it was hilarious the way Joan is always five steps ahead of her bungling would-be killers. They have to be real dimwits to believe that each would have had the time to write a note (on their monogrammed stationary no doubt) after Joan foils their poisoning scheme! I also learned of a beautiful book by a Swiss philosopher -- here is a quote from his diaries that's used in the film: "Let mystery have its place in you; do not be always turning up your whole soil with the plowshare of self–examination, but leave a little fallow corner in your heart ready for any seed the winds may bring, and reserve a nook of shadow for the passing bird; keep a place in your heart for the unexpected guests, an altar for the unknown God. Then if a bird sings among your branches, do not be too eager to tame it. If you are conscious of something new – thought or feeling, wakening in the depths of your being – do not be in a hurry to let in light upon it, to look at it; let the springing germ have the protection of being forgotten, hedge it round with quiet, and do not break in upon its darkness; let it take shape and grow, and not a word of your happiness to any one! Sacred work of nature as it is, all conception should be enwrapped by the triple veil of modesty, silence and night."
I bought this new restoration blu ray blindly on Amazon, based on the synopsis and being a sucker for San Francisco films. This is a thrilling, excellent film noir and I'm excited to revisit it soon.
Joan Crawford definitely delivers, stunning and memorable performance. Featuring a decent cast, and script 7/10.
mood: joan crawford dreaming about all the different ways she could die
A wonderfully acted thriller that isn't as thrilling as it should have been. It starts off so well, but then just flatters which leads to an incredibly messy third act that felt like a drag getting to. (I laughed at the ending more than anything) There's a lot of concepts/themes/moods here that I wish they held on which I'm sure would have made it a more exciting film. But if anything, we get a great performance out of Crawford (which for some is enough I guess) and Palance, and the cinematography is pretty great in this film. So yeah, not a bad nor great film, just one I wish took better advantage of it's premise.
I loved Bette Davis first but Joan Crawford is surprisingly super likable. Damn. Guess I can't feed into the feud narrative by picking a side, they're both talented and entertaining to watch on screen.  Sudden Fear is just another film that makes me certain marriage is the most dangerous thing in the world...
Going to be honest -- ten minutes into the film and I was starting to get annoyed. Things were moving too sudden for my liking. First minute she rejects him, then she meets him on the train back home and they're in love?? OKAY then. Once we get past all the unbelievable, poorly paced bullshit that litters the beginning, this film is amazing. Incredible, really. And Crawford swoops in and steals the picture right from the hands of Jack Palance and Gloria Grahame once things get going. Basic gist: Joan Crawford is Myra Hudson, a wealthy heiress and playwright based out of San Diego who just launched a hit show. She fires, and then subsequently proceeds to fall in love with the brooding, creepy looking Lester Blaine (Palance) and marries him. Things start to go awry when she discovers his true intentions: marrying and murdering her for money so he can live happily with his lover, Irene (Grahame). Seeing Crawford react and respond to the revelation of intended murder is perhaps my favorite part of the film (aside from the end, but no spoilers here!) She is chilling to watch -- in the scenes that follow where she has to engage with Blaine after just learning his true intent, you can see the sheer terror that she tries so hard to mask. It's unbelievable -- almost meta acting. Joan Crawford acting as a scared woman acting normal. Other fun tidbits I enjoyed: this film is sex heavy for 1950s standards. Of course, nothing is shown, but there are many references and implications (and even a scene where Palance tries to pull the covers off a naked Crawford, oh my!) Joan, in her mid 40s, looks phenomenal. It is nothing short of pleasing to the eye to see her in such flattering garments. I would absolutely watch this again. 3.5 stars only because of the beginning. And, for the record: AMAZING falling action and ending. Joan deserved that Oscar!!
Myra Hudson (Joan Crawford) is a successful playwright at work on her latest play. She fires the leading man, Lester Blaine (Jack Palance), because she feels he's wrong for the part. She later meets him on a cross-country train trip back to her hometown of San Francisco. Sparks fly and the two wind up tying the knot. And then....well, this IS a film noir. Highly enjoyable suspense flick earned Crawford her third (and final) Oscar nomination. Nifty black & white cinematography makes great use of light and shadow, as well as its 'Frisco locations. Joan's character is a nice change of pace from the usual roles of this type - she's proactive in dealing with her predicament, as opposed to just acting like a victim until the last 5 minutes.
In which Joan Crawford’s wardrobe gets its own title card with credits given to her gowns, furs, hats, jewels, and even her lingerie! Apparently, Crawford read the novel by Edna Sherry between midnight and 4am, and "by daybreak I had Sudden Fear shot and ready for release." In love with the source material and coming off the back of the flop of This Woman is Dangerous, the film she hated more than any other in her filmography, she boldly opted to take 40% of the profits instead of her then $200, 000 fee, a decision which ended up netting the astute actress a cool $1 million. That's not even the best bit of trivia from the commentary track of the new 4K scan recently put out by Cohen Media. Director David Miller was handpicked by Crawford based on their previous working relationship, a job he took on the proviso that he was able to tell the hugely powerful star to "Go F**k yourself" if she tried to steamroll him over significant directorial choices, a stipulation he actually had written into his contract! As for Crawford herself, onscreen, nowhere are her abilities to pull complete, concentrated focus on a scene, better displayed than an extended five-minute sequence of her listening and reacting to a recording; over the course of that time, gradually going from happiness and contentment to the horror and rage of 'peak Joan'. She's maybe the only big star from whom Gloria Graham didn't completely steal the picture, though I was fascinated to later learn that Graham saw Lady Macbeth qualities in her character that led her to re-read Macbeth, as well as Othello for her qualities as a first-class schemer. Elmer Berstien contributes an impressively panicked score (only his third at the time), but what impressed me most was Miller's construction of the Bunker Hill finale. Though this locale has been used so memorably in a score of great film noirs, including personal favourites Kiss Me Deadly, Cry Danger and Act of Violence, Miller's chase sequence has a brio and dangerous, Kathryn Bigelow-esque intensity that anticipates her own superb foot chase in Point Break. Commenting on the absurd, cruel irony that ends this same sequence, the critic Geninne Basinger points out that "nowhere is the foobar of two women turning up in similar dresses more of a fashion crisis than Sudden Fear."
Joan Crawford featuring a Gun and a Guy who Done-Wronged Her...Can't go wrong with that!
The last 20min of the film is superb!
I would love it if Joan Crawford shot me
Wonderful, wonderful film that builds a lot of suspense from point-of-view. Interesting Third Man-esque chase at the end which was great because it was not what I was expecting. Palance gives a great, quirky performance but this is really about Crawford. I feel this is the best performance I have seen from her. So raw and emotional; very vulnerable but strong-willed in the face of danger and despair. She did not all of a sudden become a mastermind just because this was a movie. She was totally human throughout. The change of her facial expression at the end while walking away from the accident at the end was perfect.
Includes Kitty Cameo.
A fabulous thriller starring Joan Crawford as a wealthy playwright who learns that her actor husband (Jack Palance) and his lover (Gloria Grahame) are plotting to kill her. What makes this an unusual film for its time is that Crawford learns of this scheme early on, and, after being terrified only briefly, decides to turn the tables on these motherfuckers and destroy them before they destroy her. The suspense really kicks in when her plan does not go as she expected. It's kind of a pioneering film, decades before Ripley decided that, no, the Alien was NOT going to get her, showing that women can take matters into their own hands and they do not have to be cowering in the corner while their husbands try to kill them. I would credit this to Crawford's influence as executive producer and the female screenwriter she hired, Lenore J. Coffee. Crawford is excellent here, as are Palance and Grahame, and the film is very stylish and suspenseful, and obviously influential to many similar thrillers that came later.
When a dictaphone is shown in the home office of a writer with such elaborate demonstration, you know it’s going be a key plot device later in the film. And that’s the thing with Sudden Fear. It’s not so much boilerplate woman-in-distress noir, as it is rather conventional and obvious. Leave it to star Joan Crawford and an excellent Gloria Grahame and a slithery Jack Palance to give heft to this piece. And old San Francisco gets shown off in some glory as well, maybe not as primely as in a couple other notable SF noirs, but still pretty nice. I’ve always had some weird issue with Crawford, just the extremity of her visage. Those eyebrows! That mouth! Those eyes, almost always glaring. But she’s very good here as the semi-spinsterish successful playwright who foolishly falls for an actor she fired (Palance). Grahame on the other hand is pitch perfect as Palance’s floozy girlfriend, pretty and nasty. I guess that’s why there were movie stars. To elevate mediocre pictures to decent ones.
Quite brilliant noir thriller. Some of the most memorable camerawork in the genre, imo.
Two films in one, and both are great. The first half is a brooding but mostly light romance with both Crawford and Palance surprising me with the restraint in their performances. I fully bought into their romance. In the second half things turn, and the shift in tone carries over to the cinematography and performances, which get broader and creepier, but still very effective. Crawford did great with the role, selling her various changes in mood and resolve. The final sequence is a real treat.
Really well-paced with great camerawork and compelling performances all around. Clever plotting that holds your attention until the totally bonkers ending. Crawford is surprisingly vulnerable.
Very slow, and plodding thriller from the early 1950's starring Joan Crawford and Jack Palance. Crawford was still very beautiful in her 40's, and had a powerful presence on screen. Jack Palance was no slouch either on the big screen. However both talents deserved better than the material offered up in SUDDEN FEAR, despite their respective Oscar nominations Based on the novel by Edna Sherry, and directed by David Miller, SUDDEN FEAR tells the story of Myra Hudson, a wealthy heiress/successful playwright who marries Lester Blaine, the handsome actor she had previously fired from her hit play. Yet their fairytale romance is not what it seems, for Lester Blaine has a hidden agenda: his wife's money. Worse, it turns out that the true love of Lester's life is not Myra Hudson, but one Irene Neves (Gloria Grahame). In fact, Lester plots with Irene to kill Myra, and take all of her money. Will Myra be able to foil the crooks' plans, and save her life? Despite the talent involved, SUDDEN FEAR is a mostly dull, by-the-numbers thriller whose approach to suspense is through broad, predictable and highly derivative brushstrokes. Joan Crawford is wonderful, yet her Myra Hudson character makes contrived, foolish choices that only seem to purposely place her in danger. Jack Palance and Gloria Grahame are fine thespians, yet their respective characters were written as foolish nincompoops incapable of accomplishing anything. Been wanting to see SUDDEN FEAR for many years, so I was glad to see the movie regardless of its own merit. That said, having now seen SUDDEN FEAR, I can only be glad that everyone involved in the film moved on to better things...
Sudden Fear has a very apt title, because what happens is sudden, and it indeed induces fear. The stakes in this movie change very quickly, executed through an overly convenient plot device (one of a few too many in the film) that might make you go, "oh, COME on", but none of that derails this under-appreciated thriller. Almost every choice made after that big turn is extremely cinematic and satisfying; the back half is full of secret plans, double crosses, and moral vindication. The Oscar-nominated cinematography displays some incredible visual storytelling, and reminded me of Conrad Hall's gauzy black-and-white style from The Outer Limits. (Not composer Elmer Bernstein's finest work, though.) Crawford gives a typically dynamic performance (this is the definition of a star vehicle), and Palance excels at his task to be imposing and ambiguous, as his character requires the audience to project many things onto him. The movie also contained this outdated line, which turned me into an 11-year-old for a second: "I'm going to San Francisco tomorrow."    "Oh, that sounds very gay." "Doesn't it?"
A satisfying and, at times, genuinely thrilling piece of noir. Joan Crawford, save a few moments of facial overacting, gives a solid performance as a woman who might not have married the man of her dreams after all. Jack Palance gives an adequate performance as do the rest of the supporting players. Surprisingly well done.
rewatched this with my mom and now she demands more Joan Crawford films.
First half is a bit slow. Crawford often plays "tough dames", but her character here is believably sympathetic and likable. The second half is practically non-stop suspense that builds and builds with many great moments and set pieces. Really unexpectedly great.
At first, I thought this picture might not live up to my expectations. But then Gloria Grahame showed up. Sudden Fear has a lot more going for it, though--like excellent use of San Francisco locations and a memorably oily Jack Palance. Most of all, this might be Crawford's best screen performance. While Daisy Kenyon & Johnny Guitar are stronger films overall, this flick makes the best use of Crawford's talents.
Got to see this when TCM played it for the first time a few nights ago. It's a satisfying Noir with all the right twists and turns. Gloria Grahame shines as the scheming girlfriend.
During the Broadway rehearsal of her new play, author Myra Hudson (Joan Crawford) decides leading actor Lester Blaine (Jack Palance) has to go, he just doesn't have the sort of face that would make her leading female character fall in love. After the show opens, she runs into Blaine on the train home to California and is soon eating her words as she is deeply in love by the time they arrive in San Francisco. They are soon married and Blaine reunites with an old partner Irene Neves (Gloria Grahame), a woman he used to work with in some sort of shady deals. They decide they could work together once again and if they are lucky hit it big, this time the target would be the very wealthy Myra. Their only problem is that Myra turns out to be much more resourceful than they figured. The story of a woman who is being driven mad by, or a potential murder victim of her husband is a noir staple that has drawn fine work from may actors, including Bergman, Fontaine, and Stanwyck, perhaps they view it as a commentary on the difficulty of a successful Hollywood marriage. But what makes Crawford's version of this familiar story so fascinating is that her actions seem so outlandish, so unexpected, that it is almost as if she is writing the story as she goes along or acting in one of her own plays. This feeling of unreality is hightened by Crawford's often stylized performance, for long stretches it is only her on the screen as she uses her face and body to express whatever emotion she is feeling, usually one of shock, fear, or intense concentration as she puts her convoluted plan into action. Director David Miller shows a fine understanding of noir conventions, particularly with his use of camera placement and fine black and white cinematography. The rest of the cast is also excellent, in only his third film the young Jack Palance more than holds up his end as Blaine who is a psychopath, and as Blaine who proves he would have been a fine choice as the romantic lead in Myra's play (and saved her a lot of trouble), while Gloria Gahame is, of course, unbeatable in her patented Gloria Grahme part. The new Blu-ray from the Cohen Film Collection looks good.
I hope there were no wire hangers in that closet
A very entertaining noir with a great lead performance from Joan Crawford.
"I was just wondering what I had done to deserve you" Very tense little thriller. Can I just watch Joan Crawford hide in a closet for another half hour?
Noirvember 2016. This was a fun one. Great use of shadows and Joan Crawford, Jack Palance and Gloria Grahame were all terrific.
Joan Crawford is queen and will forever own my ass. This film is stressful--but in a good way. It will keep you on the edge of your seat. One of Joan's best!
miniscule plotholes aside, Sudden Fear was a good, enjoyable, suspenseful film noir with few of its scenes memorable and outstanding — the lights flickering across the antagonist's face while driving, Myra Hudson walking back at the end with ambivalence shown on her face and the antagonist's face after getting off the car, readying for that chase enough to induce nervousness and anxiety. with a simple plot stirred along by a number of opposite schemes, being married to someone has never been this frightening. and let us not forget Joan Crawford saying the words "I feel so gay." in one scene. consider this a 45 out of 100 in the Gone Girl scale.
PLEASE BE ADVISED: No matter how well you think you have researched your murder plan, SHIT WILL GO WRONG.
Perfectly ridiculous in the way that only Hollywood melodramas of the studio system could be. Leads are all ideally cast and the whole thing is very well-shot and paced. The scene when Joan brings out that (beautifully) hand-written schedule of her evening of espionage ("11:00 - I leave my house") is the stuff camp legends are made of.
Joan Crawford excels as a rich but emotionally vulnerable playwright who needs rewrite, quickly, when she learns that her new husband, an actor played by Jack Palance (her in-character assessment of his abilities is right on the money) and his clandestine squeeze Gloria Grahame (as always faultless) plan to kill her. Crawford's skill as a silent movie performer comes into play here; by the second half, she has very little dialogue as the tension mounts. Skillfully directed on San Francisco locations by David Miller, who, with an assist from composer Elmer Bernstein, sticks the landing. The Cohen Media Group restoration of the film is currently on the repertory circuit.
A full-fledged star vehicle for Ms. Crawford, in this film-noir tale, she plays Myra Hudson, a rich Broadway playwright-spinster, who intuitively vetoes an actor Lester Blaine's (Palance) audition for her newest play, since his unusual look doesn’t seem to be well qualified for a romantic role, which prompts Lester’s chagrin and he rebukes that Myra is wrong for her impetuous decision. Some days later, on the train back to her home in San Francisco after the play turns out to be a hit, Myra encounters Lester, out of courtesy and to manifest there is no hard feelings, they bury the hatchet and Lester proves to her that he in fact is a virtuoso romantic suitor for her despite the age difference, and she is significantly besotted, the two tie the knot afterwards, which erects a perfect hotbed for the ensuing murder plan. There is an ulterior motive in Lester’s agenda from his very first move, when his old flame, a sensual siren Irene Neves (Grahame) arrives uninvited, the two scheme together to murder Myra after knowing that the latter will donate the bulk of her fortune to a foundation. But Ms. Crawford will not resign herself to an unwitting wife who is like a lamb to slaughter, right in the midway, Myra receives a rude awakening and unearths Lester’s sinister plan, after the initial shock and distress (which inconveniently outstays its welcome as Ms. Crawford’s one-woman show), and a clumsy act which accidentally destroys the key testimony, she straightens up and dauntlessly decides to preempt their action in her own way. Here, the movie starts to glisten with suspense, under the ominous chiaroscuro lighting, particularly designated in her favour, Ms. Crawford’s dignified mien glints intensely from resolution, hesitation, worry to utter fear, and everything is on tenterhooks, viewers vicariously experience the struggle, strain and danger from Myra’s viewpoint, playing meek and unsuspecting in front of her double-faced husband on a daily basis, cautiously plotting her counter-move in the sly step by step, while keeping hold of her usual pretence without arousing any suspicion, she must be a natural actress herself to fake a glamorous fall from staircases without any damage done to undercut her mobility, also a first-rate penmanship-imitator, and practising her first-ever plan of murder in her mind, which is a dead giveaway that things will not proceed exactly in the way as she has envisaged. The biggest question is, is she as good killer as an actress? Is she capable of pulling the trigger when the crunch arrives? The script mercifully (or rather cowardly) saves Myra from being the ultimate executioner of poetic justice, lest it would blemish Crawford’s iconic benevolent image, she is never a noir heroine, and here, she is ever so close to be one, an Oscar nomination is quite rewarding, it is the only time, she and her arch-enemy, Ms. Bette Davis (in Stuart Heisler's THE STAR 1952) are competing in the same category, although both are the charming also-rans in this case. An angular, hatched-faced Jack Palance is an unorthodox leading man in his career breakthrough role, who has no qualm in oozing venom while being hospitable and deferential. Yet, he is routinely degraded with a BEST SUPPORTING ACTOR Oscar nomination, high-fives with his fellow nominee Richard Burton in Henry Koster’s MY COUSIN RACHEL (1952), an Olivia de Havilland’s vehicle, two glaring examples of Academy’s category injustice for budding leading actors. One of the strong points of this David Miller’s thriller is the cinematography from Charles Lang, greatly taps into the forbidding nighttime of San Francisco, e.g. the final chasing sequences in the steep streets, sufficiently surpasses the ongoing action itself. Finally, a friendly advice to all female viewers, sometimes, you have to stick to your instinct of the first impression, simply because it is a life-saving bonanza bequeathed by nature itself, don’t easily throw it away.
A slick little thriller from 1952 that showcases Joan Crawford's ability to carry a movie. She starred in a lot of high-quality stuff (like "Mildred Pierce" for example) that any actress would have shined in, but it's when she landed in more middle-of-the-road material that she was able to illustrate her star wattage, because not just any old actress could take a movie like "Sudden Fear" and make something memorable out of it. In this one, Crawford is a playwright and reluctant heiress who decides the actor chosen for the lead in her new drama (Jack Palance, darkly but disturbingly handsome) isn't right after all and has him booted. He meets up with her a few months later and lets her know there are no hard feelings. Indeed, not only aren't there any hard feelings, but the two end up getting married after a whirlwind romance. Only after they're married do we find out that Palance is unsurprisingly a creep and that he and his jilted ex-wife (or current wife, I'm foggy on that point), played with bad-girl relish by Gloria Grahame, have designs on getting their hands on Crawford's dough. Let the plotting begin. The twist in this one is that Crawford finds out about their plan without them knowing, and proves herself to be a sharp cookie in hatching a counter plot to save her skin. It's quite refreshing to see her take matters into her own hands rather than simper and quail waiting for someone else to save her. The ending, a chase through the dark streets of San Francisco, is a bit of a mess, but by then you've had so much fun with the movie and Crawford has won you over with her ballsiness that you don't much care. Crawford received her third and final Academy Award nomination for her performance, and Jack Palance was nominated in the supporting category as well. Perennial Oscar nominee Charles Lang won his 9th of an eventual 18 career nominations for using shadows to make the most out of San Francisco's murky streets and Jack Palance's razor sharp cheekbones. And Sheila O'Brien landed the last of the film's quartet of nominations for designing Crawford's elegant black and white gowns. "Sudden Fear" is a treat for film noir lovers, Joan Crawford lovers, San Francisco lovers, suspense thriller lovers, or anyone who just loves a good old fashioned entertaining movie. Grade: A-
Very suspenseful noir, the edge-of-your-seat kind, I almost couldn't stand the tension. Crawford is excellent, particularly in the scene where she sees herself in the mirror with the gun and breaks down. The sequence with the time schedule and Crawford's eyes and the envisioned string of events is really well done, as is the thrilling finale, where Charles Lang's beautiful photography and Elmer Bernstein's exciting score are perfectly in sync. Also, great performance by Jack Palance, and let's not forget the wonderful Gloria Grahame, always a pleasure!
After rejecting an actor for her new play because he doesn't look like a typical romantic leading man, the playwright marries the actor and slowly starts to believe he may be planning to murder her. It's a typical noir plot, but the film is surprisingly good. When I first saw this years ago, I thought it was pretty awful, but I have no idea why. The film is fairly solid with solid performances all around. That is, save for Gloria Grahame whose performance as Jack Palance's devious girlfriend is pretty hysterically bad. It's like she's trying to be a teenage Mae West or something, but it doesn't translate very well to the camera. But Palance and Joan Crawford are both solid and play really well off one another. Crawford's contained hysteria is much better here than it is in films like "Possessed" but not quite as good as her later psychobiddy brilliance. She vogues her way through the shadows which are, admittedly, really well-done. The cinematography is solid and evocative. And Palance with his incredibly angular face is really menacing and crafts a distinctive noir villain out of, on paper, a really boring baddie. "Sudden Fear" is good. It's not incredible by any means, but it's got a pair of excellent stars doing some of their best work.
I am not entirely sure why I was slow to watch Joan Crawford movies. Better yet, I'm not sure why I cannot recall her in the ones that I had seen before becoming enraptured by her performance in What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?. Watching her final Oscar-nominated performance, I am left understanding why that is. In the battle of Crawford vs. Bette Davis, I side more with the latter. Both were supposedly the bad girls of classic Hollywood, but I cannot entirely buy into what Crawford does in Sudden Fear. The film isn't bad by any stretch. It's a solid take on film noir with a lot of great transparent imagery. In fact, the art design for this film is the highlight of the entire production. You buy into the tension because of how the camera moves around the set and presents fantastical imagery for you to buy into Crawford's lunacy. The issue is that the story itself is almost too simple for its own good. Crawford hears that Jack Palance wants to kill her, and spends the rest of the movie panicking about it. The third act has its moments, but this is more of a point to see Crawford do that campy shtick in a melodrama. She sells it, but I felt like there had to be something else to sell the film. It could be that the film was initially a bit of a slog transitioning to the California sequences. We see that she is a playwright. That's perfectly fine. However, it never serves a point to the back half of the story - and that's a little disappointing. I get that she needs an excuse for a state-of-the-art Dictaphone, but that can't be it. I think that if she used her theater skills to save the day, maybe the film would've redeemed itself with a few more points. Otherwise, it's a tad disjointed once you get the initial set-up out of the way. I don't know if this is an irrational complaint, but it's one that made me want some theatricality to enter stage left. I want to like Crawford more than I actually do. She definitely has a presence that makes you notice her. She has charisma that makes her both nice and intimidating. However, I don't think this film does anything to make me enraptured by her as an icon. Maybe it's just the old curse of actresses getting Oscar nominations for their lesser roles, but there has to be something I'm missing that The Academy clearly loves. I'll keep watching her movies, but I hope that she's allowed to do more than compensate for a lackluster story with campy screams.
After a successful playwright rejects an actor for not being a convincing romantic lead, she meets up with him and he romances her then marries her to prove her wrong. But something more sinister is afoot. Joan Crawford and Jack Palance both give excellent performances in what's otherwise a rather contrived thriller of the "my husband might be trying to kill me"/woman in distress sub-genre. The third act is quite good but the rest of the film feels rather overlong and dragging. But Palance and Crawford manages to mostly keep your attention.
Myra Hudson: Remember what Nietzsche says "Live dangerously!" Lester Blaine: You know what happened to Nietzsche? Myra Hudson: No, what? Lester Blaine: He's dead.
Wow my first time seeing this film and I loved it! Amazing directing and cast especially Joan Crawford and Jack Palance
Why You Get to Know People Before You Marry Them I suppose it does happen sometimes. Some people meet and just know. There are some people who know each other for hours or days, marry, and stay madly in love for the rest of their lives. I'm hesitant about it, though. I think you're much more likely to divorce if you don't get to know the person you're marrying. This may be in part because I've seen so many movies like this one, but on the other hand, how many romantic comedies and action movies are there where the two people are clearly destined to end up together despite having known each other for hours or days? So I guess how Hollywood takes the whole thing and looks at it as "how this is going to go depends on what genre you're in." I guess it is, at that, the other way 'round--how it goes influences what genre you're going to end up in. In the real world, you are frequently going to end up in a drama. And, yes, sometimes, it goes badly enough so that you can end up in a film noir like this one. Hopefully a little less ludicrous and histrionic, though. Myra Hudson (Joan Crawford) is an heiress who is also a successful Broadway playwright. One day, she is at a rehearsal for her upcoming play, which is to star Lester Baine (Jack Palance). Only she watches a rehearsal and decides that he's wrong for the role. Indeed, this is actually because she thinks he's freaky-looking and not someone that a lovely young woman would be obsessed with. He lectures her on the actual appearance of Casanova and storms off. A month later, they are on the same train west together. They talk, and she becomes captivated by him. Unbeknownst to her, he even buys a ticket to San Francisco to keep talking; he was originally supposed to get off the train in Chicago. After a rapid courtship, they marry. Her lawyer suggests a clause in her will that he only inherit if he doesn't remarry; she rejects the idea. However, Lester sees the will before she has it altered. His conversation with his ex-girlfriend, Iris Neves (Gloria Grahame), about it is caught on Myra's Dictaphone. Myra overhears the recording, which basically implies that she shouldn't start any long books. So okay, Joan Crawford was fourteen years older than Jack Palance. He was only four years older than Gloria Grahame. And, frankly, she looked like Joan Crawford and Gloria Grahame looked like Gloria Grahame. All this is true. On the other hand, he looked like Jack Palance. This also feels like another one of those movies where they're relying on our being aware that she's Joan Crawford instead of actually putting in character development. She talks repeatedly about how happy Lester makes her, but does she ever do anything else? She oversees a rehearsal and gets Lester fired, and that's practically all we see her do. We know that Lester marries Myra for her money, but we never see enough to believe much of anything else, or to know why she would believe much of anything else. That latter is considerably more important, because the revelation about how he really feels should come as a shock and doesn't. The scene with Myra's elaborate plan in response to Lester's overheard conversation with Iris is the best-made part of the movie and pushes this just barely into recommended territory, but only just barely. It would be higher except for how even that sequence contains a few things that are just ridiculous. Like the idea that Myra wrote down a timetable for herself, apparently so that we could see her planned actions with that part of the timetable superimposed over it. I suppose it's to make us aware that it's how she's imagining things will go, but that didn't work for me. Not "I didn't like it"; I mean it didn't work. I didn't realize until at least halfway through that we weren't watching events as they play out. Maybe it would have if I hadn't seen such things played seriously in other films; I don't know. It's a shame, though, because the sequence including the planning and the actual execution is extremely well done other than that and one or two other details. Like the fact that I assuredly do not believe Joan Crawford deserved an Oscar nomination for it, though the field was so dismal that it makes me want to go look up what else was released in 1952. (Now that I have looked it up? Maureen O'Hara. That is all.) I suppose it also bothers me that those fourteen years are as big a deal as they are. If, in 1964, a version of the movie had been made with Jack Palance as the writer and Shirley MacLaine as a young actress conspiring along with Jon Voight, would you find that believable? I mean, yes, Jack Palance is creepy-looking, but that actually got less true as he aged into his face, so never mind that part of it. We're a lot more okay with Jack Palance as a romantic match for Shirley MacLaine than we are with Joan Crawford as a romantic match for Jack Palance. Heck, we're not always okay with Shirley MacLaine and Jon Voight, and I looked it up. He's four years younger than she is. (Actually, I went looking specifically for someone four years younger than her. Would you have preferred Peter Yarrow? Which would have been unbelievable for other reasons.) Yes, the point is made at the beginning that he isn't the most handsome guy in the world, which is vital in some ways to how entrapped she becomes by him, but that doesn't make her a washed-up old hag, either.
Great performance from Joan Crawford in this solid and beautifully shot film noir. Joan is ably supported by Jack Palance and Gloria Grahame as the husband and mistress who want to kill her. The film has a very thrilling end sequence filmed in the streets of San Francisco.
A little bit of Joan Crawford goes a long way for me but this is nonetheless a very effective thriller. flickersintime.com/1952/sudden-fear-1952/
Joan Crawford received her third Best Actress Academy Award Nomination for this well-made vehicle, while co-star Jack Palance was nominated for Best Supporting Actor. Rich, mature Crawford marries the young and charming, if rather unattractive, Palance. Accidentally, she learns that her seemingly loving husband and his lover (Gloria Graham) are plotting to murder her. After a night filled with shock and fear, she plots revenge. An impressive scene showcases Crawford’s ability to wordlessly express these raging emotions. Another in a fine series of films Crawford made in the decade (1945-1954) after departing MGM and going to Warner Bros.
Joan Crawford received her third Best Actress Academy Award Nomination for this carefully tailored vehicle. A rich, mature playwright marries a charming younger man. Accidentally, she learns that her seemingly loving husband has a mistress, and they are scheming to murder her. After initial shock and fear, she plots revenge. This scenario allows Crawford to express her emotions,loving, shocked, fearful, angry, vengeful, with a range of impressive facial expressions. In one tense scene, she is trapped in a closet as her murderous husband prowls the room. Only a small strip of her face is lighted as she peers out, clutching a scarf to still her breathing. Her large eyes mutely express her terror. Jack Palance and Gloria Graham are quite effective as the murderous plotters. Palance was nominated for a Best Supporting Actor AA.
Excellent film noir, Joan doing her best as always, great quality thriller👍.
Joan Crawford has a deep chocolatey mousse of qualities. A fierce strength of character and intelligence, a woman making this man's world look a half-life; but a strata of weakness buried where only love can frak it. Weakness borne of pride. This movie and Mildred Pierce exploit these qualities to the fore, the way a romantic comedy three-dimensionalises Cary Grant. These are the only two of her films, that I have seen (and I'm disqualifying the bizarre Baby Jane), so I'll start to rectify this fault with "Humoresque" (Garfield!). This is a brutally written piece; so much plot in the first half. Crawford and Jack Palance fit this material perfectly; an incendiary pairing. The match is Gloria Grahame! Crawford screams melodrama so you beg for her to be hurt. You want to see the torture writ exponential across her face. Pain galvanises her. The weight of betrayal makes her stand taller. Some people like to watch the world burn; some need the flames to become their real selves. Subtle mystery wouldn't suit this Phoenix. A racing plotline, that delivers the punches in blurring combinations is her tempo. How many leading men could match this force. The young Palance has this physical density. When Crawford casually dismisses him for not meeting her ideal for a romantic lead; he dismissed her as casually. When they next meet, accidentally (?), you wonder how much of that rejection is playing on his mind. In fact, Palance acts as though evil is banging down the doors of his purported innocence. Whilst he remains too good to be true, he seems so very, very good. There weren't enough movies made of this dark velvet to allow Palance to be the star he deserved to be. Like Swanson said, the movies got smaller. Shakespeare wasn't around to write noir.
If "Bette Davis Eyes" is a four-minute pop song from the '80s, then "Joan Crawford Eyes" is a totally uncompromising Captain Beefheart song with a weird time signature that still manages to completely rock. And "Gloria Grahame Eyes" is a Prince song.
It’s only right that Sudden Fear’s twist-laden and suspense-filled plot would unravel on the zigzagging streets of San Francisco’s Russian Hill district. That neighborhood’s many narrow-winding paths, along with its famous crooked Lombard Street, serve as the perfect backdrop for this noir fashioned story of love, betrayal, and murder.
Featuring an over the top melodramatic performance from Joan Crawford, this is nevertheless a great story with a fantastic climax.
If you can accept the premise of Joan Crawford as a very successful and rich playwright and Jack Palance as a romantic lead, then you should be able to enjoy this twisty but somewhat ludicrous femme jep movie from the early 50’s. Joan who was 47 at the time and approaching her gorgon period plays as I said a hot playwright who is also an heiress with a large home in San Francisco where most of the movie takes place. The film opens with a rehearsal of her new play in New York, with Jack Palance playing the lead. Joan has qualms about him not being romantic enough (read handsome) to play the part and has him fired. So of course on the cross country train ride that Joan is taking back home to San Francisco after the play opens to smash reviews, who should also be on the train but none other than Jack. Joan is all so sorry for firing him, and before you know it they’re playing poker and having breakfast as the train speeds on to the city by the bay. Well Joan of course falls madly in love with Jack and soon they’re in montages taking in the sights, and dining and dancing in all the hot spots. And then they get married and its darling this and darling that until Joan discovers by accident a devious plot Jack is hatching with his old girlfriend played with hellish relish by Gloria Grahame, all blonde and bad. Joan who has had many moments of over the top acting in her career really soars in this one and I swear at one point I thought her eyes were going to pop out of her head. Palance who excelled at playing villains throughout his long career simply gives away the show by being well Jack Palance. What with his unattractive face that looks like a cubist portrait with mud thrown on it, or a bruised boxer’s mug, and in fact one of his famous roles was as the battered fighter in “Requiem For A Heavyweight” that he did on Playhouse 90 in 1956 andh e does have a down and dirty animal magnetism that works well in his scenes with Grahame (kiss me, kiss me hard she moans to Palance). The film is a bit slow and tedious in parts, because there’s so much plot but the last hour is good and goosy with a beautifully done if improbable ending. Smoothly directed by David Miller who began his career directing sports shorts like “Table Tennis”, “Hurling,” “Racing Canines”, and “Aquatic Artistry” and went on to direct feature films most notably “Lonely Are The Brave” in 1962. With a good thumping score by Elmer Bernstein, and cinematography by the great Charles Lang who received an Oscar nomination for his work. Also Oscar nominations for costume, Actress and supporting actor. Surprisingly considering that this is a Kino release both the sound and the transfer leave much to be desired.
Great film noir/thriller with clever story and strong performances and direction.
50's Joan Crawford is my favorite Joan Crawford. Jack Palance was the perfect creepyhot villain, and Gloria Grahame is just awesome at all times.
Sorry, Joan Crawford's eyebrows still scare me.
I prefer Aldrich's similarly themed Crawford-in-trouble Autumn Leaves. It is soap turned noir whereas this is more noir turned soap.
Myra (played Joan Crawford), a playwright decides that Lester (played by Jack Palance) shouldn't star in her latest play, to his displeasure. They later meet on a train travelling across America and after a whirlwind romance marry. All is not rosy however - Myra is a rich woman, Jack is a man with a girlfriend who'd like to get his hands on her money, and he's in a hurry so it will have to by foul means rather than fair. f you can raise yourself above the level of spotting things that people wouldn't have done in the situations they find themselves in this film, this isn't a bad film noir.
Absolutely brilliant, a masterclass in suspense. This is how you do it, Kathryn Bigelow.
[Gloria Grahame, Joan Crawford] I sort of liked the beginning when it was sort of a love story. Once it turned into the 'thriller', I lost almost all interest. I usually always love Gloria Grahame, but she was just a shrill obnoxious character. This might be the first thing I've seen Crawford in. She was fine in those early parts, but when she was forced to mug with a horrified or scared look on her face, she became uninteresting. Jack Palance is kind of like a lesser version of Christopher Walkens. He can never be lost in a role, but his presence is always interesting.
Crawford gives it her all. The plot took a long time to get going, and while it got much more suspenseful as it went along and the latter part of the film contained some good ideas, it didn't entirely satisfy me on the whole.
This film is a noir/thriller ? I have a hard time telling the difference sometime, but going by the way it is shot, I would say it is an Noir all the way. In fact it is one of the most brilliantly shot films I have seen. I can't quite say the same for the plot which is a lot of fun to watch unravel, but it is one of those that have you constantly asking yourself why didn't she just do this or that? Joan Crawford is quite good in this and so is Jack Palance, and Gloria Grahme is always good.
What a weird thing. Glad it exists.
Dafoe leathered up on a hydra-glide is an iconic look to rival The Wild One. Not so much in the way of story but Dafoe delivers some great narration and classic lines throughout. Good twist in the final moments. Great leathers and even better sickles.
This is the kind of debut from a director that says to me, "I didn't have a plot or budget that supports a plot, but to prove myself here's a movie anyway, fuckers". Willem Dafoe leads his gang of 50s goths on a journey of minimal introspection even as they are stuck in a one-horse town, trying to get down to Daytona for the 500 (I will never not geek out over casual NASCAR references in film). Not much happens besides the gang trading quips back and forth in their ancient teenspeak, which reminds me a lot of the merry band of molokos from A Clockwork Orange. Here it's kind of grating to the ear to watch and listen to everyone underact their persona. It's at least nicely shot, and approaches something of a story when the bikers cross paths with what amounts to this town's oil baron. In its final act, it's almost pretty likeable, but stilts on a batshit ending. Deep down it's a film about outcasts, but less about them causing trouble than being caught in a pot where trouble's already been stirred. If you wanna see Dafoe's dick 'n' balls, come take a ride.
This film just ended and I have absolutely no idea what it was about. Good soundtrack, though.
The Loveless is the first feature film by Kathryn Bigelow and co-directed by Monty Montgomery, whose only other credits consist of screenwriting and producing. It's a fine film, especially considering its student background and limited scope of production. However, it really only has three strong draws: It's recreation of the lower-class 1950s, it's meandering slice-of-life story, and Willem Dafoe's debut performance. The last item is the only one of any personal interest to me, so while I think it was worth a watch I don't see a whole of merit to the film as a whole. That soundtrack, though!
Should've watched Scorpio Rising before this; Bigelow has said it directly influenced The Loveless, and this sure is full of leather-clad queer-coded masculinity. Willem Dafoe is eroticised to within an inch of his life and it totally works; the film simmers with repressed violence and sexuality until it all predictably erupts at the film's conclusion. For an 82-minute film this is pretty languorously paced and stretched my attention span a few times, and it suffers from the common low-budget period-film downfall of being set in a specific time period but looking extremely of-its-time instead. But you can feel the oppressive Southern heat in every frame, Dafoe is magnetic as hell, and this is a pretty essential insight into Bigelow's early work and what would become her enduring fascination with the violence enmeshed in our culture.
Somehow boring and captivating at the same time. Imagine if this had a solid plot behind it, hot damn.
Kathryn Bigelow does a New Wave "The Wild One" with Willem DaFoe. Heavy on atmosphere, short on good dialogue.
Homage or parody? You be the judge?
I love Willem Dafoe in basically anything, and he does well here, but this is a pretty slow-moving film with some pretty mediocre performances. It definitely picks up towards the end, but it takes awhile to get there, and th but 50s cliché dialogue can be a bit distracting at times. One thing I did like—I liked that the biker gang did stir up trouble just to stir up trouble. The trouble happened because of the people who were already there, it was brewing long before they showed up, they were merely a catalyst.
Definitely a movie that does exist. It's interesting for how overtly female gaze-y it is and how everything Bigelow will become is there from the beginning, but like it's mostly kind of a snooze to watch.
Kathryn Bigelow debut film is film school The Wild One.
Watches Scorpio Rising once, makes Metrosexual Rising with babyfaced Willem Dafoe. Kathryn Bigelow's debut film, co-directed by Monty Montgomery, speaks a film school language and is surprisingly very similar to a Jim Jarmusch movie in still coolness, full of pauses and music-on-the-radio cues. But less surprisingly, Bigelow's attention is to male posturing, using a pretty boy who wants to be a bad boy, setting up a road map of great gender studies for three decades to come using genre-based filmmaking. Here, the genre is motorcycle movie, using born-to-be-wild fits of boredom to combat boomer nostalgia.

Cinematography almost wins the day, but the protagonists are never believable and the ending was ripped from a student's first-draft screenplay.
The entire movie feels like a massive exercise on being cool and turning your nose up at all the squares. Watching it today though feels like a movie that sparked the beginning of a fantastic director and the legend of Willem Dafoe.
Everything- the cinematography, the cast- looks beautiful. Nothing happens, but that's the point. A study of '50's Nowheresville through the eyes of a biker gang who stop there on their journey to Daytona.
Plotless and moody, but too long for the material.
So this really nails the aesthetics of the 50s that are the most appealing for their “coolness” and the sound design and music choices are really inspired. I really admire some of the really static shots and how long the camera is willing to hold and let the actors work in a specific frame.  But most of all I’m just confused because I can’t figure out if Willem Dafoe, who I can first remember experiencing in Raimi’s Spiderman, is actually strangely hot or not.
This is film very tied to it's environment where almost nothing happens. I have a weakness for these sorts of films and enjoyed it. Dafoe delivers a great performance, but the villain, whose name I cannot recall delivers a terrible one. The film is very mixed and your enjoyment of it fully depends on how engaged you are by Dafoe and how much you enjoy people just hanging out.
“The endless blacktop is my sweet eternity.” Acidic 50s nostalgia, monotonous yet magnetic. Carnal violence and ennui in greased hair and black leather jackets. Dafoe on a Harley forever.
I suppose this is a movie, but like so many first features by talented directors, only be the strictest definition. I kept expecting Mike and the Bots to show up in the corner and start making fun of it.
Has an authentic 50s look and feel which I quite enjoyed. The time period was very believable from the visual design to the acting. Cinematography and framing ranges from ok to really awkward. Lots of people’s heads were cut off in nearly every shot, as well as the 180 degree rule and rule of thirds were frequently broken which looked pretty messy. The story was pretty slow and eventless up until the ending, but overall, pretty solid first effort from Bigelow.
(whispering "you didn't hear it from me, kid, but you can see willem dafoe's balls in this flick")
Intriguing riff on juvenile delinquent dramas of yore, with near nonstop rockabilly scoring.  Comparisons to THE WILD ONE are fair.   Similarities to the works of David Lynch are iffy.  Debuting writers/directors Kathryn Bigelow and Monty Montgomery create a stylish but slowly paced and crudely edited sorta poem on the nomadic versus traditional mode of living.  Good first lead role for Willem Dafoe.
"Ive got an itch between my legs and an afternoon for a heart.
If this film is remembered at all, and it mostly isn't, it's as the debut of two great future talents, star Willem Dafoe and co-writer and director Kathryn Bigelow. The reason The Loveless remains mostly unloved to this day is that not much happens and the cast exhibits far more attitude than talent. So while it does succeed in striking a certain mood, said mood also isn't that engaging. This is a biker film with little motorcycle-related content as the gang lolls around a Georgia backwater in the 1950s, listening to rock'n'roll, littering, combing their hair and generally being a rebuke to the conservative values of the Eisenhower era by virtue of their mere existence. It also doesn't feel like a Kathryn Bigelow film as it contains none of her high-energy camerawork and escalating tension. For the definitive early Willem Dafoe movie and a genuine overlooked gem check out To Live and Die in L.A. (1985), and it wouldn't be until her next film, the intoxicating Near Dark (1987) that Bigelow would come into her own as a great director.
52 Years, 52 Women-Directed Films Challenge Film 18   Can I sit on it?    This movie had such a profoundly gay energy, which is what ultimately made it watchable for me.
In this movie full of debuts, it’s easy to tell that Willem Dafoe was going to go somewhere. You don’t see that immediately with Bigelow until her next film filled with vampires. (Also as an irrational thing that’s not fair to the film, I think stories about biker gangs always feel dumb.)
So this is what the alt-right wants America to be like again?
Man, I was what you call ragged. I mean, way beyond torn up. I weren’t gonna be no man’s friend today. Been out of storage for about a year now, and, to me, this endless blacktop was my sweet eternity. I knew I was going to hell in a breadbasket.  This movie is so much hot nonsense, but Willem Dafoe is sexy enough to make up for it.
a seriously deadly mix of art, influence and social commentary. I could watch this little tragedy over and over, like cool hand luke.
Tries to be so cool, but is just so lame.
The Loveless is the story of a biker gang that descend upon a small midwest town. The film suffers from a lack of plot and being dull. Willem Dafoe doesn’t bring anything special to his role other than being a brute.
Young Willem Dafoe looks like if Harry Styles was possessed by a demon
Two things that make this a curiosity is Willem Dafoe’s first leading role and Kathryn Bigelow’s directing debut (with a co-director). The easiest way to think of this is as a type of remake of The Wild One, where a motorcycle gang causes trouble in a small town. Dafoe is good and I liked the music but a lot of the 50s era dialogue was clunky and the majority of acting is quite stilted. The gang also isn’t a big terror, which is what I was kind of expecting. There’s some cool imagery and glimpses of good ideas that just don’t end up working. Not recommended unless you’re a diehard Dafoe or Bigelow fan.
The Loveless has the smell of student work about it. I don't mean that as a pejorative but simply as an assessment of the intentions of what Bigelow (in her feature directorial debut) and the multi-hyphenate Monty Montgomery (probably best known as The Cowboy in Mulholland Drive) put together over a period of 22 days back in 1980. That label, student work, is often seen as a criticism but to my mind some of the most interesting work out there has been done by folks who are putting together something only they could conjure up and by those who have done so with little regard for convention. The Loveless has many of the hallmarks we associate with that kind of work. The pacing is glacial, the narrative is as thin as a lace slip, and damn near nothing happens, however it has many of the things I absolutely love about weird little movies that couldn't have been designed with money in mind. Namely a feeling of danger, a sense of complete and total mystery, and directors and performers swinging for the fences like it might very well be their only shot to make a damn movie. Here we see a young Dafoe captivate with every word and every scowl as he stumbles from the city into a town that could just be a truck stop on his way to Daytona, Florida. That's honestly about where the plot begins and ends as the film moves into nearly exclusive existential territory, moving its band of outsiders through an increasingly hostile and ever stranger small town. Dafoe's Vance is a pleasure to watch, clear indicators of his eventual greatness on display as he becomes entwined to one degree or another with the women of the little town. His cool gaze and his hot reactions serve as the audience surrogate as he witnesses the prejudices and unfortunate behavior of both his crew and the denizens of the humid little city. It's a tone poem and a takedown of the 1980s nostalgia for the supposed halcyon days of the 1950s and Bigelow and Montgomery made a film that deserves to be in the kinds of conversations we have about Blue Velvet. While not quite as self-assured as the aforementioned Lynch masterpiece, it enters similar waters. Small town corruption and darkness viewed with fresh eyes and discomforting scenes of sexuality and prejudice set against the kind of scenic small town vistas we're more likely to associate with comfort and nostalgia. There are those "red ants underneath" as Lynch is so fond of saying. It also has one hell of an ending. I have a feeling that this is a film that will continue to grow in my mind over the years and with subsequent watches. For the time being, I can simply say this film is firmly in my wheelhouse and I am extremely glad to have come across it on Amazon Prime.
Willem Dafoe is the opposite of a vampire in the sense that he looks old at any age
i was breathless when the credits began
It never went into the “chaos” I expected or hoped for.
Cheesy with a dark undercurrent, reminded me of Twin Peaks. It was cool to see a young Willem Dafoe.
There are glimpses of what Kathryn Bigelow would go on to do, and it's an interesting debut for Willem Dafoe, but overall this is pretty inert and just ends up stopping.
i really really really want to see a criterion collection release on this
This movie had been on my radar because it is dafoe’s first movie, but didn’t realize was also Kathryn Bigelows director debut. Some strong similarities to near dark stylistically. Cool movie/ it’s very short which is generally a plus for me
It's a psycho rockabilly freakout! *sound of inhumanly high-pitched cackling*
One of those interminable kinds of grindhous flicks that just doesn't seem to have a point or an end in sight. Even so, watching the beginnings of Dafoe and Bigelow's careers was worth a watch.
A bit meandering but Dafoe steals the show as the quintessential unfeeling rocker
this film has all of my bisexual needs: 50's greasers, bikes, coca cola, women with short hair, neon signs, cinematography inspired by paintings, vague characters, and lots of leather
Made in 1982 and starring a Willem Dafoe in his 1st film. Its set in the 1950’s, has lots of black leather, greased back hair, motorcycles & music of the era. Basically, it’s a bunch of bikers killing time in a small town. It’s quite slow and not the most uplifting experience, and probably only of interest to those wanting to see a young Willem Dafoe’s buttocks
Rough around the edges but atmospheric and fun to watch.
i’ve been wanting to get a bike lately. just last week, i googled “how dangerous are motorcycles really”
Me watching 'The Loveless': media.giphy.com/media/oygbdZvAdWWys/giphy.gif
the poster image >>> the movie Lethargic, low-stakes; literally a movie about the mild debauchery some mildly gnarly people get up to while waiting on a a vehicle repair, up the very final moments, at which point occurs a violent, disturbing conclusion that comes out of nowhere and makes little narrative sense. Not at all what I excepted from the debut of a director whose career has come to be defined by knack for propulsive, story-focused action and a gift for building and releasing tension. There's no tension here, nor any action. It's just 80 minutes hanging with some dirtbags. Never would have pegged this as a Bigelow film. That said... I kind of liked it! Feels like a lost David Lynch picture. The Loveless especially resembles certain sections of Twin Peaks: the Return, with its long, silent, hypnotic drives and the constant, vague presence of some peripheral evil. And wow. Willem Dafoe has always had one of those faces, hasn't he? Even back when his skin was smooth, before it turned to treebark. He sits and blankly stares into some unknown offscreen void for most of this movie, and it's impossible not to stare right back at him in the same way, wondering what hell that man must have witnessed before we met him, what lurid life he left before hitting the two-lane blacktop.
Willem's first starring role and Bigelow's directing debut. A 50s biker gang stops on a square, hick town on the way to the races and shit happens. Off the shame list! Great, surprising ending.
Flat and uninteresting, I'll watch any Willem Defoe performance tbh
A sleepy biker movie that is mostly salvaged by a compellingly cool central performance from Willem Dafoe. Most notable for being a stepping stone for its star and co-director Kathryn Bigelow, as opposed to a lost gem.
you know why i watched this
Kathryn Bigelow's directorial debut (co-directed with Monty Montgomery) is a real moody piece of filmmaking. Willem Dafoe stars as an apathetic biker whose gang terrorizes a small town for a weekend, exposing the terror that already existed within. There's a fascinating Lynchian feel to it all, but the pacing really hurts it.
all the music in this movie sounds like it’s from the 50s but really it’s just one of the cast members doing an elvis impression and i think that’s some excellent low-budget filmmaking riGht thEre
I really like this movie because nothing happens in it and I can relate to it emotionally
Posits "cool"—the post-war, rock n roll/ Brando-in-THE-WILD-ONE vision of it at least—as, in its extreme cases, really just emotional distress, neurosis, and anxiety borne (often) from a long-held trauma large or small. Bigelow seems to focus on the moments of damage in that facade instead of those that translate to glamor or beauty or sex. Even when depicting glamor, beauty, or sex. If you squint real hard might remind a bit of Andrea Arnold's AMERICAN HONEY. Almost. Has a masterful sense of quiet, too. Rhythms not dictated by dialogue but small action or passage of time. Fantastic.
As a showcase for a new filmmaker this has a lot of strengths. The image of the 50s is strong through the soundtrack and iconography, to a degree that the stereotypes can be played around with. The compositions are also consistently attention-grabbing. On the other hand the acting is terrible from everyone except Willem Defoe. This is mitigated quite a bit though, by the fact that there isn't any story that the actors need to convey. Unfortunately that also makes the movie feel like a complete waste of time.
A stunningly well-crafted debut effort from Bigelow, this is suffused with an air of inescapable melancholy that emerges at the forefront of the narrative by the time we reach the film's haunting conclusion.
"I had an itch between my legs & an afternoon for a heart..." I've always jived with the mid-20th century aesthetic, so this has 'me' written all over it. Throw in a super young, brutally cool, leather-swathed Defoe, & I'm in celluloid heaven. First of all, the soundtrack really nails the feel of the era. Every song in this has that undercurrent of raw sexuality that was just hidden enough to be radio friendly. Although, I think the older generation just wasn't listening close enough. If you're not taking this as a sort of 'satire' of the Kenneth Anger-genre, you're not going to dig this. Every line is laced with the same dead-pan delivery. Not much happens in terms of plot, until the final scene. But the gorgeous imagery is really what this is about, & it's showcased beautifully. The authenticity of everything is spot-on. This isn't for everybody, but for those who 'get it' this is a delicious little bite of greaser angst & rockabilly swagger.
(Monty Montgomery and) Kathryn Bigelow's SCORPIO RISING
Not perfect, but damn close! The sketchy quality of the version available on Amazon Prime notwithstanding, this is one of those films that I come across occasionally that I really don't know much about, have never really heard anyone talking about, much less singing the praises of, but pretty much entirely blows my fucking mind! I can't really understand why this film isn't more in the conversation. It completely anticipates Blue Velvet, Twin Peaks and Wild at Heart (and given that it came out in 1981, it seems somewhat likely that it may have directly influenced David Lynch. And I'm not just talking about Willem Dafoe playing a character that very well could have become Bobby Peru after years of drugs and a head injury or two. There were many times when I was struck with the similarity in tone between this film and Blue Velvet. Etc.); but also deserves to be discussed more in context of first films of important directors: Kathryn Bigelow (co-directed with Monty Montgomery, about whom I'm going to have to find out more).
i did not like this. amazon prime version of this cuts out at the beginning and end.
just the bad parts of Twin Peaks + the underside of Willem Dafoe's balls = Kathyrn Bigelow's The Loveless p.s: the copy of this movie on Amazon Prime turns greys and glitches out 3 or 4 times in the first 5 minutes and then several more times towards the end and I guess no one involved noticed ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
If only the individual moments, the sinful compositions, the brilliantly lewd surprises, the perfect period soundtrack cuts, the badass final 10 minutes, added up to something.  Kathryn Bigelow's first feature and, naturally, first of many journeys into a gang of macho toughs, stars a leather-clad (and pretty great) young Willem Defoe as the leader of a 50s biker gang, shaking things up in a small Souhern town en route to the races in Daytona.  It starts and stops and then fits and then it's over. And I realized I had nothing to show for that long 79 minutes.
Student film full of potential and interest. Scathing dissection of a genre that typically glorifies a toxic masculinity. Beautiful imagery.
if you ever wanted to see bigelow eschew plot in favor of hanging out with uninteresting 50s biker stereotypes in a small southern town this is the movie for you. ill stick with blue steel 👌.  the run time is glorious though.
Some low-budget films--they're often exploitation flicks like this one--exist not because they are compelled by a story that needed to be told but because they are compelled by a moviemaker who needed to make a movie. I'm trying to be charitable toward a filmmaker I would come to enjoy. This was an attitude in search of a topic. It's supposed to be a deconstruction, but it's as aimless and exhausting as the nihilists it's trying to critique.
While it has the pacing and reflectiveness of a student production, Bigelow's The Loveless is a fascinating mood piece about the toxic masculinity of 1950's biker culture. It's dark and unsettling moments of rape, incest and suicide are quite haunting. That being said clocking in at roughly 80 minutes, this movie manages to feel long and often lost my attention. I like that it sets the stage for the rest of her filmography and is a great introduction to Defoe but I can't imagine anyone really loving The Loveless.
This is a surprisingly great little film consisting almost entirely of atmosphere. It's primarily concerned with filling out every corner of its period environment with little details and ambience. The characters aren't so much up to no good as they are up to nothing at all... loveless/thoughtless/aimless... a minor work that feels both lived-in and still alive.
A much quieter film than I was expecting but I think that works well for what Bigelow and Montgomery are trying to convey. The 50's were just as messed up and hard to live through as any other time in modern America, even when viewed from the rose colored glasses of the 80's. The Loveless is a not so subtle takedown of masculinity, but the directness of the themes is countered by how contemplative and reserved the camera is. As the bikers are hooting and hollering the night away the silent horror of what one girl has done is viewed from afar by our protagonist Vance, a man so distant he feels nothing. This is all conveyed without dialogue. A harrowing but wonderful sequence to end an impressive debut.
Basically the only pure "hangout" movie I've liked, because it understands what a good majority of hangout movies do not; the setting must be a character, as much as the characters themselves. Like a lot of debut filmmakers, Bigelow's still learning the style/substance balancing act, but her raw talent here is almost tangible. We feel the 50s, oozing out of the screen, every beautiful, terrible, bigoted part of it. It's still a bit too plotless for me to rate higher, but Bigelow shows that you don't necessarily need plot to demythologize an era. When you build a time and place up so convincingly, you don't need to tear it down; by the end, the audience will feel so trapped, we'll want to destroy it ourselves.
a crowning achievement in the depiction of drinking out of glass bottles on screen
This is a strange movie. It's very slow and methodical while not really having a straight plot. It feels more like a collection of events than a story in a film. Willem Dafoe is great, as always, and he really carries the film out of mediocrity. It's not a great movie, but there is definitely a level of craft here that I can appreciate.
Some cool visual stuff going on here, really liked the look. Felt like an Easy Rider for a later era, just much less successful.
As a deconstruction of 50s motorcycle subculture and masculinity it works, but as a movie it works less so at time. At times exhilarating and at times languishing, it sits awkwardly between great and tiresome. I can't tell if I love it or not.
KB should go back to making kenneth anger movies
Shows the early seeds of what Bigelow will do later on, but in the end it's slight. Dafoe is excellent though
Interesting to go from Strange Days to this, because that is a movie defined from its very first shot by forward momentum and not catching its breath (to its disadvantage in a few spots at the end, but a total asset otherwise), whereas this is paced like an IV drip and feels longer despite being a good hour shorter. That being said, I wasn't really bored during it, mostly due to the combination of Willem Dafoe, some nice shots, the music, and the wonderfully overwrought tough-guy lingo, and I actually think it kinda lands the ending for as much as it dithers around aimlessly in the lead-up. But I cannot see myself thinking about this movie much after tonight, and soon my thoughts will return to Angela Bassett's all-encompassing ownage.
Why aren't we all just constantly eating breakfast at diners?
I'm all here for sexy, young, leatherclad Willem Dafoe, but this thing is just so slooooooooow. Call it a 'tone poem' all you want, doesn't change the fact that its boring as hell and I can't remember a thing about the characters or story.
A kind of shapeless tone poem of a movie, but there's definitely promise that indicates Bigelow's future career. Fascinating to consider how steeped in style and mood this film is, considering how uncompromisingly austere her latter-career films have become. (This isn't meant to be a negative, but there's no denying that her recent filmmaking has a real austerity to it.)
Relentless. What a debut for both Bigelow and Dafoe.
There was no love.
Great soundtrack. The movie itself is kind of boring. Felt a lot longer than 100 minutes
Can roll with it enough for about 30 or so minutes, then just gets old. 79 minutes, feels like 119.
Rating: B- This movie was good. Definitely not great. Unfortunately it did feel a bit stretched and thin. Willem Dafoe chews the scenery. I kinda dug it? Ah I dunno..
Boring. Its ambitions are lofty but its execution comes off pretentious and half baked.
Aimless and confusing. There is absolutely no point to this film but at least everyone gives decent performances.
The Loveless is all vibe and no juice, a film so enamored with affected boredom that it becomes boring itself. It's still stylish, though, and Bigelow gets the formula exactly right in her next film. As per usual, what she has to say about femininity is a lot knottier than her take on masculinity, which is as coruscating as in her more well known films. Willem Dafoe is truly disarming as a babyfaced greaser, as opposed to the craggy weirdo I'm used to.
Marin Kanter tries to compensate for her anachronistic pixie cut by being insufferably belligerent. Thankfully the film seems to realize this and gives her an appropriately pathetic death. The rest of the edge, coming mostly from a posse of four dumb, pretty leatherboys, is adorable. Willem DaFoe brings some subtle charisma to the lead role, and the whole thing just has a nice relaxed period realism to it. Bigelow and Montgomery address composition and lighting with a very even hand, and Gordon brings an atmospheric soundtrack. It's just all-around good filmmaking. And then suddenly DaFoe is taking Kanter from behind and you can't help but do a triple take, wondering why it just turned into a gay porno. It's certainly not the only homoerotic moment in The Loveless.
Femtember #1 Bigelow completely and utterly dispels the myth and preconceptions of the biker gang film. It's like the complete opposite of Kenneth Anger's fastball approach of montage and music. Taking a slow burning view of a group of biker's who stop off at a small town diner on there way to a professional car race. It strips away many of the tropes associated with the genre that was popularized by films like The Wild One or even Rebel Without a Cause, creating a portrait of youth trapped within a set of pre conceived notions. A fascinating work from start to finish but one I understand the indifference toward. Personally I think it's one of Bigelow's best or at least amongst her most internally fascinating.
A biker gang roles into a small southern town where they kick up a bunch of muck and leave their wreckage behind them. Focuses highly on the bikers and less so on the actual wrecking. Co-written/directed by the cowboy from MULHOLLAND DR.
I watched this but nothing happened. Willam Dafoe is a greaser who sits at a cafe with other greasers for a few days and they talk about nothing that makes sense and then the movie ends. My husband loved it. Said it was like Twin Peaks. Would have been a great 15 minute short though.
Bobby Peru: The Early Years
Not to be annoying but when is leather-clad Willem Dafoe going to ride his motorcycle past me when I'm stranded on the side of the road and fix my car and steal my money and make out with me and terrorize the small town I live in with his homoerotic motorcycle gang?
Such a student film, and basically just a vaguely engaging Wild (cl)One, but...something about it sticks? Main takeaway is that I hope Willem Defoe has started eating better.
"I've got an itch between my legs, and an afternoon for a heart." Kathryn Bigelow's first feature film was this low-budget biker film, which she co-directed with Monty Montgomery, who would go on to produce David Lynch's "Wild at Heart" nine years later. The film shares Lynch's conflicted view of the 1950s - it revels in the cool of the era, but it's also willing to expose the menace that lies beneath the decade's bucolic surface. Willem Dafoe, in his film debut, stars as a 1950s Detroit biker who gets stuck with his gang in a seemingly sleepy southern town while on his way to watch the races in Daytona. The filmmaking is self-possessed, as cocksure and collected as Dafoe's character. But it's tortuously slow. It's only 82 minutes long, and yet it feels padded out. Still, the style and Dafoe's magnetism are mostly strong enough to carry it.
Cruises on atmosphere for most of its short running time before delivering a well-staged violent climax. Fascinating gender politics, should be considered before leveling the charge that Bigelow gives women short shrift in her films.
Feels more like an extremely gifted student film than a proper feature; if the Bigelow of later years is here in any particularly clear way, I'm not sure where. Still, it's a terrific first feature, capturing something about the mood of '50s biker culture that has a different kind of menacing undertone than one might expect. Willem Dafoe, in his first film, is better as a presence than an actor per se - though what astonishing presence it is. Mostly worth seeing for curiosity's sake, but it's curiosity that will be amply rewarded.
This started off fascinating and deliberately paced and I was so excited to see how it would use the character to make the story more exciting...but it never really got more exciting. The story just kinda chugged along with nothing really happening; I didn’t know anything about the characters and nothin paid off. I’m not sure what changed for the characters from beginning to end, they showed up in a town and left it a bit of a mess but I wasn’t sure what the point of it all was. I mean, maybe I’m asking too much of every film I watch to leave me fulfilled but this one in particular I thought had such potential in the first act...and never acting on that potential in any meaningful way. The performances and cinematography were great but I couldn’t help but feel as though the lack of story damaged the other aspects of the film. Let me know what you think of this and what all the movie means to you, I’m open to having my mind changed! 6/10
Not really a full movie, but an interesting start to an amazing career. Two careers actually. Dafoe crushes.
Mostly an excuse to play around with rockabilly aesthetics, but there are a few moments that rise above the rest and make for an enjoyable enough time.
In lieu of director Kathryn Bigelow's Detroit, I feel it is necessary to watch how far she has come to become one of Hollywood's best and most socially conscious directors. Though it has committed performances and maintains a strong sense of place, The Loveless is a methodical, experentially nihilistic biker drama that effectively homages 1950s biker films, but cannot overcome its dispassionate characters and rudimentary narrative. More importantly, one can tell that Bigelow wants to explore America's cyclical racial tensions, but lacks the perspective and experience to do so. I am glad she waited until she was ready, and I have no doubt that her patience enabled her to crush it with Detroit.
All I could think of was Scorpio Rising so I immediately turned on blue velvet
only cool part of this was when a racist scumbag shot herself! nice!
Definitely style over substance, but luckily it turns out that Kathryn Bigelow has always been pretty great at style. Willem Dafoe oozes nonchalant cool, and it's fun if you're in the mood for pure '50s nostalgia, even if the actors sometimes stumble over the knowingly cliche-heavy dialogue.
A wonderfully well-realized sense of place and time, with just the right amount of satire to it -- and a marvelous soundtrack -- but eventually the lack of a, you know, coherent story kind of wore on me. Not at first, but after a while.
Nothing happens for 70 minutes and then a rush of plot and tragedy in the last 10. A biker gang orgy certainly seemed possible.
come on kathy
[44/100] Stylish, with some nice colors and compositions, and with the cool '50s soundtrack constantly humming in the background, it's frequently a great hangout movie. This last element is maybe less Hawksy than American Graffiti-ish, but leaning more comic-book than fly-on-the-wall realism. Either way it creates a memorable setting. For me, the social commentary elements came across as fairly vague, and The Loveless felt forced as it ramped up the seriousness in the final 20 minutes. I didn't end up getting too much more out of this than the great vibe and the fascination of watching the young Willem Dafoe. There is definitely some promise in the visuals and the hazy, unhurried nostalgia of the lonely southern highway diner and Scorpio Rising iconography, but I'm not sure how much it all adds up to.
This movie is like a mutant offspring of Easy Rider and The Breakfast Club.
Unlike some of the best 'hang out movies': Rio Bravo, Stranger Than Paradise, Jackie Brown, Dazed and Confused (and Slacker and Waking Life and most of the other Richard Linklater films), the characters in The Loveless are no fun to hang out with. Not because they are immoral or try not to show any real emotion, but because they are a bore. A better way to experience this movie for maximal enjoyment is to allow yourself to roam around the southern locations it takes place in. The movie is a paired down distillation of a certain style these bikers embody, with a crisp and elegant visual style, a lack of self-realization that is acknowledged during the climax and a sort of world-view at the edges of the frame. It also isn't very interesting or fun. I guess the one real reason to see it is for Willem Dafoe's first leading performance in a movie.
Is Willem Dafoe hot? A case study.
early proof that Kathryn Bigelow only makes movies about bad boys, preferably of the leather-clad variety. lots of sallow southern atmosphere in this one, like a tick could bite ya at any second. fuck 50s nostalgia, and if this were made today, fuck 80s nostalgia. Willem Dafoe should join up with the Fast Family.
Dafoe gives a wonderfully virile and cocky performance, and the 1950's small town setting is captured well, but a scant plot and terrible supporting cast prevented this from shining.
Dresses itself up like a party animal and then sits in the dirt and does nothing for an hour and twenty minutes. 'The Loveless' is the equivalent to a goth poser kid angry at his suburban parents for wanting to buy him new shoes. We get it! You are so edgy, dude. I'm sure later you are gonna write some really deep stuff in your journal about how Dad wants you to play sports. Get off it. Sad too, because Willam Dafoe could have acted the hell out of this role if he was given an actual character to play. Spoiler alert: Kathryn Bigelow later learns how to add substance to style.
I've decided to attempt to write a few sentences on here everytime I watch a movie so I can remember more than just my initial vague impression. Anyhoo, I can't say for sure without having seen the 50's and 60's movies this is modeled on whether this is a homage or a deconstruction of those tropes. Either way, it's distractingly mannered and the camerawork is impressive in a kind of insufferable way a lot of first films are. Luckily Bigelow turned out to be great so I don't feel too bad for not liking her debut all that much.
It clearly has its flaws. But at the same time, it's absolutely perfect. Fuckin' art.
Kathryn Bigelow's first, Willem Defoe's first. That's all I can think to say about it.
Well, that was kind of boring... But on the upside Willem Dafoe sure does make a bunch of Willem Dafaces in this and those are always.... Oddly compelling to look at
It's a shame that a damn plot had to happen to this movie, because it's at it's best when it's just hanging around in neutral. Like a cool, sexy, drifter... Agreed, the film would be little more than biker iconography, early 1960's eye-candy and moody tough guy narration without it, but that's enough I think - especially at 82 minutes - you can get away with something a bit more sparse. Regardless - this is a unique and wonderful little slice of early 80's American Independent cinema. And, Willem Dafoe, come on - you gotta love him. He moves his body so deliberately here, casts his eyes so specifically and easily, what a screen presence. A bit more like a model than an actor in some ways, and dressed like he walked right out of Kenneth Anger's Scorpio Rising.
“We’re getting ourselves some liquid entertainment” Kathryn Bigelow’s debut feature feels very much like a debut – it’s loose on plot, heavy on mood, low-budget and the first trembling touches upon themes the director would later explore more. Willem Dafoe (in his second role in his career) fits smoothly in this mold as well, but he doesn’t exactly breathe life into the silent biker-character we’ve seen before. The same kind of character has also had more heavy themes tied to him in other films, Dafoe’s silent character is a good contrast to the macho group that’s often seen in biker-films but while he’s somewhat outside of that masculine heteronormative mold it’s never really explored. The Loveless has some great groovy music to bring the right kind of cool to everything and it fits the laidback, thin story. Unfortunately, the anonymous characters in the periphery of Dafoe is given too much of the spotlight as the film trades the nice silence for empty dialogue. It’s an interesting mood-piece as a start for Bigelow and Dafoe – but with such thin jabs at themes the director would go on to explore much more it’s ultimately not very spectacular.
Willem Dafoe, you sexy sonuvabitch. I'm intrigued by your sweet tooth & the way you eat your eggs. I respect the limited dialogue & mood cast in Bigelow's directorial debut. Although the pacing is likely to turn most people off, there are enough captivating shots sprinkled throughout to keep you watching & intrigued.
Stylish and restrained at times, the debut feature co-directed by Kathryn Bigelow with the debut of Willem Defoe as a biker in the 1950s. Impressive art direction and writing that is a bit loose with some of the more cliche elements of 80s films showing up, it's more of an exercise than a fully realized film, but interesting in how it predates some of the other takes on the 1950s.
It's inconsequentially short, and historically interesting for being both Bigelow's first feature (a co-directed effort with Wild at Heart producer Monty Montgomery) and Willem Dafoe's first screen-credit. Storytelling wise it's pretty aimless, meandering, even a little boring, but the signs of potential are there and it exudes a certain "coolness."

This movie is worthless trash. Sorry, Kathy Bigs <3
"So what's a bum got to do to drive this thing?" "Turn the key."
This is Kathryn Bigelow's directorial debut, along with co-director Monty Montgomery. Set sometime in the 50's, it follows Willem Dafoe (also on his debut), as Vance, a biker that's cruising through a small mid-Western town, along with some friends. While in town, Vance and his friends meet a wide array of characters, among them, a diner waitress, a mechanic and his son, and an oil businessman and his young, rebellious daughter. In that respect, the film is a bit loose with no defined plot structure. The characters just go from place to place without an apparent connection. It is only in the last act that they try to build up a climax between Vance, the oil businessman, and his daughter, but it feels a bit forced and underdeveloped. Despite these flaws, the film was never boring. Plus, despite some scattered weak performances, most of the cast is solid. Dafoe, in particular, has a strong performance. Finally, at roughly 80+ minutes, the film is short and breezy.
I do like a film that has a strong sense of mood, and films that are more character than story. This film is all of those things, but I think its shapelessness is actually a bit of a problem. At times it can work, and it feels dreamy and engrossing, but other times it feels frustrating and dull. I don't need likeable characters to enjoy a film, but I do need something MORE than what's on display here. I adore Willem Dafoe but his character is slight to the point of being just an image. With Bigelow behind the camera, you do get the feeling that that is maybe the point, but she would go on to couple that dreamy imagery to more fun and likeable movies later, particularly Point Break and Near Dark. It's one for Bigelow completists, but it is and it is a somewhat interesting curiosity - the kind of film you might find while flipping through channels late at night and stick with just to see what the hell it is. And while it has flaws, it does have something that has left me thinking about it the next day.
pretty extraordinary. great sdtk (Robert Gordon so...duh) w/add'l help from John Lurie, and a knock-out brilliant ending. Biker film extraordinaire for sure. Low budget glory!
" I ain't as white as I look." Def gets a star just because Defoe is a babe.

You wanna know how I got these scars?  It feels like a first film and it definitely drags. The 80-minute runtime felt closer to 120. But hey, Kathryn Bigelow had to start somewhere and this is just fine as a jumping-off point. Included in these lists
I like that I watched this movie; it was interesting to see the depiction of 50s hoodlums, and Willem DaFoe's performance was good. But it wasn't a very good movie to watch due to some drag and a general ennui that emanated from the characters that made me wonder why I should care much about them. I've hit a low point in my #52moviesbywomen project
What a sick bike flick. The only thing missing from this film is some sick burnouts and donuts. Sexy Willem Dafoe, what a guy.
Kathryn Bigelow's film debut, conceived of and co-directed with fellow Columbia student Monty Montgomery, a future producer for David Lynch who plays the cowboy in "Mulholland Dr.". Willem Dafoe (in his film debut) stars as the leader of a bike gang travelling through the south to get to a stock car race. One of the bikes breaks down in a small town and the locals clash with the bikers. This sounds like an exploitation film, but it's more of an art film that bathes in the exploitation cool of the biker image (a bit like Kenneth Anger's "Scorpio Rising"). In a quite literal sense, nothing happens for a lot of the film as people stare at each other meaningfully. Nonetheless, I found it mesmerizing and it is vaguely reminiscent of a Lynch film with all of the weirdness removed. Rockabilly musician Robert Gordon co-stars as a fellow biker and provides most of the score.
Slow pace and uneven storytelling, but beautiful cinematography and a charismatic performance from young Willem Dafoe. The best part is the soundtrack by Robert Gordon and John Lurie, which is downright Jarmuschian.
the ghosts of the highway. how fucking boring it is to be lost and the chaos that can form out of directionlessness. everyone is a l o n e. is it our own faults or is natures genuine study of human to be alone. its how we live, its how we die. bigelow's kind of proto-near dark where the biker aesthetic is alive and the vampires arent mythical forms but rather the mythical lie that the road and being a western nomadic is romantic.
Nothing about this was appealing, interesting, or effective. Except maybe the soundtrack. But nothing else. It's all either setup or outlandish, detached terribleness. We should all be glad Kathryn Bigelow moved on to action movies, as "nihilistic Jarmusch ripoff" didn't fit her talents well at all.
What a cool picture. Killer soundtrack.
Any film with Robert Gordon in a Leather Jacket gets an extra half star, and "The Stroll" by the Diamonds gets another half star--that makes a total of one star. The diner is probably worth another half star, though that total would wildly overstate the value of the screenplay and filmmaking here.
"You know, I ain't never seen nothing 'fore like it in my life *spit* they're animals. Hell, I'd love to trade places with them for a day or two." The feature film debut of director Kathryn Bigelow who co-directed with Monty Montgomery and the first leading role of star Willem Dafoe. There's no plot per se. Just a group of bikers (led by Dafoe) in the 1950's hanging around diners and garages, driving around and conversing pointlessly. The flip side is how the locals react to their being around. This slow moving and nihilistic biker film is stunning to look at, with every image being fetishised; Leather, diners, belt buckles, flesh, lighting, garage interiors, hair, bikes and cars. Every line of dialogue is peppered with pessimism, cheese and style. The soundtrack is outstanding and works in perfect harmony with the love Bigelow, Montgomery and DP Doyle Smith put into the visuals. Everything in the film is captured with as eroticism and emptiness. Its like a dreary partial fantasy come to life. If the film occasionally (or largely) feels stilted the style more than makes up for it and though it's definitely given priority over substance, I wouldn't call it entirely empty. I loved this film.
This movie was really neat. It takes after like this subset of pulpy biker movies, evidently, but it rather reads as sorta the anti-biker-flick, from what I understand them to be. It's very very slowly paced and there's a very legitimate degree to which you could argue nothing happens for a long long chunk of the movie's runtime. That's sorta the point. There's a bunch of bikers who ride into town at the beginning of this movie and rather than the like vaguely pirate-ish portrayal and understanding of bikers, they just kinda mill about and do normal shit until they're ready to move on. The people in this town, though, get really antsy really quickly, and that's what the film is getting at, that people beget this movie's violent ending due to their own expectations and projections onto the bikers rather than anything they actually do themselves. I think it's really fascinating and at its best the movie can sorta carry that tension in it purely visually in that way that Bigelow exploited a lot in her two most recent films, even as essentially nothing is happening. It's a dangerous gamble, though, and one she ends up falling ill of on more than some occasions. I would be impressed to see anyone make something so actively kinda distancing completely work at any point in their career, much less as their first film, and Bigelow definitely didn't totally swing it, it can drag quite a bit. That sorta synergizes with some stuff that's not like a huge problem but makes the movie offputting as well; it's very dedicatedly aping the sort of pulpier elements of those aforementioned biker movies, which include some really goofy performances and some really leaden dialogue and at its best that can be really charming but when the movie starts dragging it certainly doesn't help right the ship, let's say. One of the performances is actually Willem Dafoe in the lead in his debut and I wish I could say he arrived with all of his magnetism intact but, not quite. All of that said, though, I ultimately find myself thinking really fondly of the movie and think it's very natural that this is where Bigelow got her start. I'm excited to get through a lot more of her films!
Decent directorial debut from Kathryn Bigelow. The movie is shot well and has great music. The plot is a bit too thin though. The movie is set up like The Wild One but it feels a lot more realistic so much in fact that it just kind of drags. This movie is a definition of a slow burn and I liked it but I also felt it could have done a bit more.
Eww to anyone who puts ketchup on your scrambled eggs.
Leave it to Kathryn Bigelow to make such masculine films which fuel dangerously on the sensitivity within most of all. Her "The Loveless" is one of those post-greaser movie types that bleed the lines between James Dean vulnerability and "The Outsiders" posing with the story of bikers including a young Willem Dafoe fueling his character with a fractured frame that feels as put-on as it does naturally so. While Bigelow’s "The Hurt Locker" and "Point Break" seem to be about the man’s chase for adrenaline-spiked orgasm, her directorial debut was more intent on capturing the way people can shift their own personalities through their faux-performance art.
How did I never know about this flick until yesterday?? I'm not a huge Bigelow fan, but I love Near Dark, Strange Days & Point Break. On the other hand, though, I'm a massive Willem Dafoe fan and just look at that cover!! How could I not love this film??! Objectively, I guess if you weren't a fan of either of these thngs then you probably wouldn't like The Loveless. It's a slow, meditative, almost plotless film about a motocycle gang who's mere presense causes a small, backward town to fall apart. It's part arthouse, part exploitation biker movie - but all Willem Dafoe. It all takes place during one day, and almost entirely in a single location (a diner). Words are spoken, but they rarely matter. 50's rock songs are played continually and hypnotically as Dafoe and his band of homoerotic biker buddies stir the pot. Surrounding them are curious but distrusting locals - many of them damaged or dangerous themselves - who are mostly hostile towards them. As the day goes on the tension builds and builds until the inevitable, explosive climax tears the town apart. This all makes it sound like there's a lot happening, but there really isn't. The Loveless is definitely more of a Mood Movie. Some of the major plot points are dropped in conversation but mostly we learn everything we need to know from characters simply looking at each other. The 50's soundtrack is super cool and prevents the film from ever become tedious but if mood ain't your bag then you're definitely going to struggle with this movie. Speaking for myself though, i LOVE mood and The Loveless is moodier than most. Between the tense directing, decent performances, brilliant soundtrack and Willem Dafoe, this movie delivers just about everything I look for in an arthouse/exploitation flick. (which this definitely is) A recommended curio.
The Loveless plays out like Easy Rider meets The Wild One, except it's set in the 50's. It's a slow burn of a movie and to tell you the truth nothing much happens in it that would keep anyone's interest. Willem Defoe is a great actor don't me wrong but he just seemed so out of place here as cool cat Vance, a member of a motorcycle gang heading to Daytona for a bike race. This is an early film of Kathryn Bigalow's, you can see her style taking shape here, it's probably one of the better things about the film. Also, the soundtrack is pretty great.
Very strong debut film, and even though Bigelow co-directed, her style and themes are as present here as in her later works.
First films are not always Reservoir Dogs. I keep telling myself this as I work through my podcast's latest run of Home School Film School - First Films from Notable Directors. Kathryn Bigelow's first film doesn't show the pension for action for which her future films will be known. However, it does show the thoughtfulness take on tough guys and violent moments. It's slow, but I got into the weird groovy thing going on in the hour and 22 minute runtime.
Kathryn Bigelow's feature directorial debut, and Willem Defoe's first starring role, was not what I was expecting. This film is almost 35 years old, yet hearkens back still further to the 1950s with its imagery obviously reminiscent of The Wild One, and also putting me in mind of Douglas Sirk to a certain extent, but without the melodrama. Nothing much happens - small town ennui is too much to take for the bikers who are passing through - but the oppressive mood is almost Lynchian, probably driven by the soundtrack. It's interesting that Bigelow should so often focus on the male in her films - I don't know enough about her or her work to comment in any depth, but she definitely brought a different perspective to the male peacocks astride their Harleys.
Existing somewhere between David Lynch and Kenneth Anger, The Loveless is mostly Kathryn Bigelow still trying to find her style but with a conclusion, I personally appreciate: when outsiders stir up trouble in a small town, it was because there was trouble to be stirred.
this movie is supes coooooool, slow-burning, pretty shots, great soundtrack.
I totally love how this movie looked. Great compositions, great wide shots, awesome colors, etc. A real slow tense pace. Plus, the sound track is sweet.
The music in this film is great.
This catatonically slow existential biker movie attempts to channel themes present in Kenneth Anger's Scorpio Rising with The Wild One and fails to work or be in anyway engaging. It's unfortunate considering that The Loveless was Kathryn Bigelow's directorial debut and Willem Dafoe's first starring role.
Sort of like The Wild One, with a pinch of Russ Meyer, a dash of Kenneth Anger and a sprinkle of Tom of Finland. Interesting debut from Bigelow that is quite different from her films to come but still is an interesting observation of masculine culture through a retro lens.
You know how people say that foreigners make the most interesting movies about the United States? Well, (and take this with a grain of salt, because who knows how much ought to be attributed to Montgomery) the same can be said about Bigelow and masculinity. This is a cool first film, though not without flaws, especially when it comes to the pacing, which is maybe a little too deliberate—the intention may have been to mount the tension slowly, but the tension just is not always there. The imagery is interesting and composed, with rare but very deliberate camera movement. I guess the concept might be: The going nowhere fast thing involves a lot of doing nothing. In the motorcycle movies that this is sort of deconstructing, you have got these characters who cultivate an image but aren’t given any other real character. So, what you get is a bunch of people who are kind of aggressive dicks but don’t really do very much, but even so, the townspeople react to them as if they’ve been super-active public menaces.
Vance is like a younger cousin to Defoe's Bobby Peru, a monster that wouldn't surface until later in the decade. Until then, Kathryn Bigelow's portrait of a long afternoon full of tension between backwoods Georgia locals and greaser ex-con bikers plays out like a preamble. The burner is low, but the heat that will soon rise out of David Lynch's 1960s is very imminent in THE LOVELESS.
Low on plot, but throbbing with mood, The Loveless is America's subversive nature wrapped in lurid colored undergarments. Every frame is bursting with lust, loneliness, and homoeroticism. Bigelow (along with Monty Montgomery) directs with a flare for compositions rarely seen in her later works. The colors and framing here are preludes to the '80s fascination with the '50s that would be so prevalent in Paris, Texas, Stranger Than Paradise, and Wild at Heart.
Masterclass in capturing the sound and atmosphere of the South, something that recent films seem to struggle with. The Once Upon a Time in the West x Sal Mineo in Rebel atmosphere is unique and they pull it off in the most earnestly heart wrenching manner, something eludes most road films. Though maybe its because this is the only road film where they never end up leaving.
Bigelow cites Fellini and Bertolucci as well as Ulmer, Benedek, Sirk and Anger as role models for this, her film school thesis. Great photography, art direction and editing if not much in the dialogue and plot department. Willem Dafoe's movie debut.
Pointless story of greasers in a town for the day that ends in pointless violence. Quite dull.
Curious, offbeat debut for Bigelow (and co-director Montgomery) is well shot and amusingly apes '50s biker teen movie tropes to nihilistic ends, but performances and storytelling are wobbly at best, never really convincing.
It probably says something about Hollywood, that the only woman to ever win an Academy Award for Best Director, makes such masculine movies. With an Oscar win for The Hurt Locker and a nomination for Zero Dark Thirty, Kathryn Bigelow is no stranger to making tough as nails movies about tough as nails characters. And with Point Break, she has a genuine action movie hit to her name, that seems to be more and more beloved as time passes and nostalgia grows. So even though I knew absolutely nothing about her debut before I started watching it, it was no surprise to see that there’s a bubbling pool of testosterone at the core of The Loveless. FULL REVIEW AT boredanddangerousblog.wordpress.com/2013/12/03/movie-review-director-debut-week-bigelow-the-loveless-1981/
Bigelow's arch ars poetica–Lynchian before that was a thing–gives the name violence to a stillness borne of Jean Genet & Kenneth Anger. An affected analysis of cool on par with Rudolf Thome's Rote Sonne. Free, wild, cool and death-like. (Monty Montgomery went on to produce Wild at Heart and the pilot to Twin Peaks, and to play the cowboy in Mulholland Drive.)
This Interesting and dark reimagining of 50s nostalgia is the underseen debut from Kathryn Bigelow - I was interested to check this out because I heard Bigelow talking about her admiration for and influence from Douglas Sirk, one of my favourite directors, on a special features from Madman's wonderful DVD edition of Interlude (1957). Considering the only Bigelow I'd seen was Hurt Locker, I thought this a peculiar reference point, and she said how much in particular it affected her first movie. And I kind of see it, (though the more obvious reference point for the film is The Wild One with Brando) and it's a cool little film of its own. It has a cool soundtrack, a great sort of coloured style and so on, and a great performance from a very young Willem Dafoe, who retains all his unique diction and menace from some of his more effective roles later, and he's great to watch. The acting among the rest of the players is pretty mixed, and there's not a lot to differentiate the characters or any real story. It's just a sort of cool movie, if not exactly great.
An excoriation of Reagan-era nostalgia for the Fifties, in the manner of Christine and Blue Velvet. The central image has Willem Dafoe swathed in leather from head to toe, posed atop his motorcycle against roadside verdure and bathed in bluish light. As it did for Kenneth Anger, The Wild One provides Kathryn Bigelow and Monty Montgomery with a key into a culture’s trance of polished metal and violent sensuality, l’amour et la mort. "This endless blacktop is my sweet eternity," the biker leader muses, a "weekend in the country" pits the daddy-os against the leery, envious small-town squares. Dafoe saunters into a café in a rhomboid composition scored to Brenda Lee, then into a bit of Hawksian courting around the jailbait tomboy’s (Marin Kanter) corvette: "What’s a bum gotta do to drive this thing?" "Turn the key." The gang slut steps out for a Coke while the fellas throw switchblades between each other’s legs, the tangled flesh of Dafoe and Kanter in the motel room is alternated with race-riot footage flickering on a TV screen. Finding the kinetic melancholia in this material is a job for Walter Hill (Streets of Fire), for angular, languid, deadpan satire you turn to Bigelow and Montgomery. A film-school thesis stretched to feature length, yet the hunger for pure form is unmistakable -- the South is a coiled abstraction of extra-crimson soda machines and garages, a phosphorescent green cloud surrounds a waitress as she strips down to her pointy bra. The pop-art lines could be out of Lichtenstein, with their disproportionate intensity humorously reflected in a scene in which a tiny matchstick is lit with a hail of target-practice bullets.
This film has moments that feel like a David Lynch film. I have to say that I will never watch this film again because nothing really happened in this film for the hour and 23 minute film. There was some great moments in it mixed in with the moments where nothing did happen. William Defoe is good in it because it is not what he says but rather what his face says. It is like the Wild One just not as good.
Kathryn Bigelow's feature debut, with writing and direction assistance from Monty Montgomery (who would later go on to produce for David Lynch), is light on substance and loaded to the hilt with style. Set at the tail end of the '50s, it's essentially a mood piece about Willem Dafoe (in his first starring role) and his small biker gang rolling into a sleepy nowhere town in the south, and the various ways the locals react to their arrival. With the briefest of excuses for a script, don't expect a whole lot of surprises in the story department. The town offers up the usual assortment of characters – repressed women who see the bikers as either filthy animals or sex on wheels, resentful rednecks with the trunk full of guns, and a few regular people inbetween. Dafoe is reliably charismatic in the starring role. Marin Kanter, who reportedly quit acting shortly after this movie, is also memorable in the role as the rebellious teen Telena. The rest of the cast is a very mixed bag, with plenty of wooden acting and the occasional burst of scenery chewing on display. But Bigelow and Montgomery are clearly more interested in fetishizing the '50s rockabilly culture than telling an original story, and are happy to let the so-so acting and clichés slide along, as long as it's captured beautifully and with a lingering gaze by the camera. And that it is. Bigelow fans will have no problem recognizing her signature style, albeit in a slightly undisiplined, early form here. The tone of the piece is not a million miles away from that of Near Dark, and the two movies could comfortably be programmed together as a moody double bill. Bigelow would of course go on to make better movies (the aforementioned Near Dark in particular), but The Loveless makes for a stylistically satisfying start to her career. The lack of substance and originality will leave non-fans of the director to struggle to find something to enjoy here, but in the end that's entirely their loss. One greasy thumb up for The Loveless!
Kathryn Bigelow's debut is a cheap mimicry of the 50s road picture. In his first ever starring role, even the reliable Willem Dafoe disappoints. Take a look at the full review here: 366movies.com/2012/10/16/270loveless/
Amy Schumer is quite an actress in Trainwreak but less of a scriptwriter. Her stand-up shows are such a raw and funny experience that they set a standard to anything she does. While a pleasant experience to pass the time, the trouble with Trainwreak is that is presents itself as a genre film (coming of age comedy), thus establishing the audience’s expectations, but at many times it delivers the shape of a drama, in the Hollywood sense of the term.
Its fine.   Also Bill Hader is a national treasure.
The movie sorta ends on a flat note. Some scenes are worthy, but as a whole, Trainwreck doesn't really do it for me.
Really fucking funny.
two stars for brie larson. only
I know by now to not be fooled by the marketing for a Judd Apatow film. What seems like a comedy on the surface is rarely actually a comedy. 'Trainwreck' is funny at times, but definitely not the comedy presented by the trailers. That doesn't mean it's bad... but to be honest I'm having a hard time saying much positive about the film: it's way too long, writer and star Amy Schumer seems in over her head in the lead role, Bill Hader is utilized as more of a straight man than he should be. Those things being said, I think LeBron James has a career in acting when he wants to retire. Hilarious and pretty good timing. There's a lot more going on beneath the surface, but sometimes that's not a good thing. Its goal, first and foremost, was to succeed as a comedy and it didn't do a very good job in that. That nullifies anything else. I'm sure if you're a hardcore Amy Schumer fan perhaps there was a lot to enjoy. As I am not one, I was a bit out of place. I will give this a 3/5, although I feel like I'm being a little generous.
I can say that Judd Apatow is one of my most favorite comedy directors now.
why the fuck is this movie so long
As a known rom-com and Amy Schumer hater I went into this film expecting to be bored, annoyed and dismayed in equal measures. Instead I somewhat enjoyed myself. For all its crass humour this film has a sincere heart to it. I'm glad too Schumer isn't afraid to be un-pretty (though the unflattering outfits tended more towards distracting). There was a spark of the real in how the film shows relationships as flawed, imperfect things but worth it anyways. Still way too long though, especially when you're waiting for the inevitable break up and reuniting.
Commentary
Watched this for Bill Hader, stayed for Lebron James. It was alright. The rift in their relationship seems really trivial. I mean, a lot of people now have commitment issues so I think that  people are more open to discussing that. But really, idk what and why those happened in the third act.
Trainwreck is a train wreck of a movie. It's sad that celebrities making cameos are the only good thing one can say about the movie.
One star because I didnt know Tilda Swinton was in it until the end and that was a nice surprise.
a bill hader thirst watch
I think that Amy Schumer was right to challenge typical romantic comedy tropes but in the end just failed to succeed. We need more than just switching gender roles. If you’re not making the romantic interest a round character then you aren’t really challenging anything. Raising the female to the typical male role just makes the romantic interest a manic pixie dream boy rather than girl. Other than that I’d say both of their profomances were good, but it just feels like the same formula that can be seen from movies from 20 years ago.
can y’all believe anyone ever thought amy schumer was funny bc i cannot
these two stars are for bill hader and bill hader only!
Two things: 1. Lebron James can actually act and is hilarious. 2. John Cena can actually act, and balances a shower towel on his erect penis.
the scene from basterds where eli roth bashes in that nazi's head with a baseball bat but instead it's amy schumer bashing in woody allen's head
Okay catch the motherfucking tea: this was cute
It wants for some parts to be a hyperreal screwball comedy where battles of wit are replaced with improv'ed sex jokes and exasperated rants. That can and is funny in the film but when it plays a scene out underneath that zenith of wackiness it's flat because characters and sincerity aren't allowed to breathe as much as the no holds barred unrealistic cornerstones. Amy Schumer's script works best when it's specific rather than broad, based clearly in actual experiences instead of anyone-can-make-'em fuck jokes, exemplified significantly more in the much sweeter second half.
Best part about this movie is Lebron James!
Better than I thought it would be. Bill Hader is so likable.
Where’s the 90 minute cut with all of the unnecessary, unfunny, and straight up time wasting moments removed? Because that’d actually be a pretty damn good movie. I mean seriously—I can’t remember a comedy that ran so gut-bustingly hot in the first half only to flip a switch and become so excruciatingly cold in the second. Schumer’s solid here though, and unsurprisingly, LeBron is MVP. Again.
rewatched just for him (bill hader)
It took me 4 days to finish this but amazing cat Amy knew she had to makeup for her inability lol
It's funny, witty and it's smart (unlike a majority of latest American comedies), although it's a bit lengthy. Younger audience will get it's up-to-date humour. It's thoroughly enjoyable and John Scena's skit is particularly amusing.
Amy Schumer writes and Judd Apatow directs, a brilliant team-up. I love this movie, it's funny and sincere with a lot of heart with Bill Hader as an unlikely leading man. The movie even ends in a great tearjerker! Schumer isn't afraid to write emotional scenes for herself and this movie shows her wide range of acting and is way better than her pointless tv show. The scenes with John Cena cracked me up. I had a good laugh, very good!!
I guess this was supposed to be edgy and funny? but it was just boring
ACTUALLY FUCK IT
“No offense, but I just think that sports are stupid and anyone who likes them is just a lesser person. And has a small intellect.”
Fuck Amy Schumer for making this very good and relate able movie that makes me cry.
the things I do for Bill Hader.
Certainly lives up to it's name, I guess.
this was actually good??? what??? brie larson is still killing the game.
watched and  stayed for bill hader
not great... i couldn't finish it! so many great people, Bill Hader, Mike Birbiglia, Brie Larson, and I was not entertaining!
I will be the first to admit I hate Amy Schumer but her & Judd Apatow did something special with this one.
I've read Amy's book and found it a little vulgar so I wasn't overly surprised to see this movie was as well. I wanted to like this movie but found the characters just weren't that believable. Normally the lead in a movie has some redeeming and lovable characteristic about them and I couldn't find one with Amy. It did have a happy ending, in more ways than one but that still wasn't enough to win me over.
Expected more from AS but this turned out to be a fairly standard romcom. She changed who she was so the guy would love her.
Yes Amy, this was a train wreck. Also, Bill deserves better
It me
(Old impressions, not based on a recent viewing) A solid story with a decent amount of laughs, but the atrocious ending flattened the whole thing as it thoroughly betrayed the spirit of the lead.
amy schumer proves that she is in fact even more horrible than i originally thought.
skipping to bill hader scenes to avoid amy schumer is bvgc culture
(Brie Larson Marathon) Amy Schumer couldn't make me laugh if her life depended on it. Lebron was funny though, John Cena, and Tilda Swinton who is completely unrecognizable and I totally lost it when I realized who she was. So I had a few laughs here and there but overall this kind of humor is not my cup of tea, it's too long and it's flaws are getting more and more obvious, until it completely falls apart in the third act. It's interesting, however, that I did find the dramatic aspects of the movie quite effective. Schumer is actually good when she's not desperate to get a laugh. I liked the scenes with her dad but the best are those involving her sister. Which brings me to Brie Larson who never fails to amaze me. Once again, she steals every single one of her scenes and she is making it all seem effortless. Now, I'm aware that running a Brie Larson marathon means I'm paying extra attention to her performance. But I honestly believe she stands head and shoulders above everyone in this and her natural stripped down approach is so contrasted with the other characters that it's impossible to miss. And I do remember having the exact same thought the first time I watched this. In fact I did a quick check on my notes and here is what I wrote: "She is by far the most mature character in the movie. Next to her they all look like caricatures. Quiet, simple, authentic. Great acting." Now that I watch her movies back to back I realize this is always the case. Being able to act without actually look like you are acting is a very special quality and Brie Larson is a natural. This marathon also helped me realize another thing I probably wouldn't otherwise notice. She plays a teenager, then a high school senior, then a college student, all in just a two year span. And in this one she's a mature married woman, has already raised a child and expecting another one. She goes from a schoolgirl to a wife and a mom in just three years, and you never even raise an eyebrow. Man, I'm telling you, this lady is special.
A train wreck from beginning to end.
A bit too long and conventional, but the entire cast is on their A-game throughout. 8/10
"I let Tim and his brothers tag-team me on Christmas morning. And you know what? It was wonderful."
I think the film title says it best. Also why LBJ, why.
Bill Hader and Brie Larson are too good for this movie. What did they do to their agents?
Liked this better the second time (which was this time). Schumer's character is such a tramp, trampy to the extent that it's off-putting, (I was put off by it, more the first time, less so this time as I was prepared at least). The trampiness is what she has to try to rise above to get something that she ultimately wants, and that's the trick in this fairly typically plotted rom com. So, with a typical plot, and somewhat unsympathetic protagonist, Trainwreck's gotta have some other things going for it. Well, there are a number of fun characters, and to look at three of the most important, Amy's own character 'Amy', when she's not blindly self indulgent, is funny, self aware, and self deprecating. Her boss, a demanding lunatic, is one of Tilda Swinton's most dementedly hilarious performances ever, while Bill Hader plays the likeable, rational, calm, cool, and collected love interest who keeps it all grounded. The film covers the ground along the line, the one that divides taste from lack of it, jumping back and forth across it as Amy pushes boundaries, consciously going too far before reeling it back in. She's looking to have the imperfect everywoman relate to her… but I'd say the average girl doesn't push things so far, and thus the film has not been embraced as much as it would have liked.
Trainwreck wasn't a complete crash, but did derail from its comedic tracks. Look, I like comedies. Laughing, smiling or even rolling on the floor in stitches. It's a beautifully contagious emotion, allowing you to forget about your woes. So, once again, another modern comedy failed to hit the mark. I'm getting sick and tired of subjecting myself to critically praised comedies, only for the end result to be "meh". Just give me something legitimately funny! A magazine writer, who enjoys sleeping around without consequence, starts interviewing a doctor who quickly falls in love with her. Predictably, we witness her come to terms with the dreaded word that revolves around relationships. "Commitment". Say it with me now. "Com-mit-ment". Now, there were a few aspects I appreciated. The chemistry between Schumer and Hader felt natural, exhuming a sense of realism. The minimal use of typical Hollywood romantic clichés (aside from the face-palming ending) felt refreshing and certainly made the story and its characters relatable. Surprisingly, John Cena and LeBron James provided the most humour. But when the sporting superstars are far funnier than the usual SNL actors, you know something went wrong. Honestly, Schumer isn't funny. She isn't! Objectively and subjectively. Hardly a "tour-de-force" performance, however some of the emotionally charged scenes were conveyed adequately. The character she portrays is mostly uninteresting, and unfortunately is the primary focus of the story. It's Hader's character that garners the most interest, but is rarely explored with a lack of backstory. Larson and Swinton were underused. And, I've saved the best criticism til last, they spoilt the ending to 'The Usual Suspects'. Really? You honestly thought ruining the ending to a classic, to which many still probably haven't seen it, would generate laughs? Uncalled for. So besides that sickening crime against humanity, the lack of humour, boring characters and horrific ending...it's alright. It's fine. Watchable atleast. But darn it, I'm done with modern comedies. They just further illustrate how cold I am.
this film is living up to it’s name
Lebron James: supporting comedy king
The least Apatow-ish Apatow movie? Lebron might lowkey be the best athlete performance in a comedy ever (at least up there with Kareem in Airplane!)
s/o to the Emmys for reminding me that I want to marry Bill Hader hey Hollywood: put LeBron in more things! or at least actually make The Dogwalker with Daniel Radcliffe and Marisa Tomei!
two and a half stars purely for bill hader, the one star for the rest of the film. i expected this to be bad because i dislike amy schumer and just thought i’d find it unwatchable because of that but bill was amazing and looked very very good. lebron was so funny as well and brie’s parts were good. love that
Two stars for my mans and that’s IT
yeah hi hello i watched this three times just to see bill hader and brie larson
Trainwreck is going to be very much a Marmite film. I think a lot of people won’t be able to enjoy the unlikability of the lead character (played by Amy Schumer) or the uncomfortableness of much of the script. But I not only loved it, I sympathised with much of it too (especially in the scenes where she is pressured into family situations, being the devoted aunt, etc – no idea why I identify with any of that). It’s blunt and unsubtle yet clever and consistently funny. In fact, it might well be the funniest film I’ve seen since Alan Partridge: Alpha Papa. But I’d only really recommend it to singletons without children. One final thing: there is an unbelievably good cameo performance in this too, one that’s jaw-dropping when you work out who It is, or when – like me – you have to look it up afterwards.
A waste of time
How about I just say I did not find the movie entertaining
Title about sums it up.
This is definitely one of my favourite films. The comedy and the drama are both really well done, and Amy Schumer and Bill Hader are really good lead actors. There’s loads of funny moments, like the scene at the cinema, and the scene where Amy and Aaron first meet. On the drama side of things, the way they handled Amy’s dad’s death was really well done as well. This is also probably one of the most well shot comedy films I’ve seen. I’m a big fan of Judd Apatow films, and this is definitely my favourite one.
I watched this just to watch Lebron. He was robbed for MVP last year. PLAYOFFS MATTER FOR MVP VOTING. ITS NOT JUST A REGULAR SEASON AWARD. HE AVERAGED OVER 30 IN THE PLAYOFFS. HARDEN AVERAGED LIKE 8 TURNOVERS A GAME. THE NBA IS CORRUPT.
I love this movie! Amy and Bill are hilarious and charming!
Tried twice to watch this, but Amy Schumer's character was just unbearably annoying. She a bad actress - overacting her part, coming off very tryhard. I also found the gay jokes with the wrestler tiring after a while. I was surprised I didn't like this since I love Apatow's other stuff. Usually her portrays good people doing funny things, but for some reason, he chose to depict bad people, and it just wasn't endearing or interesting to me. I'm determined to finish it though since I hear she redeems herself or w/e at the end...
m.youtube.com/watch?v=wk8xBAU4RYM
Hilarious. Surprisingly attracted to Bill Hader as a male love interest...
Not particularly funny.
yep too relatable 👌
I didn't wanna watch this tonight but it was on my vudu and I hit play anyway and it was funny and I couldn't stop watching it, so. I really like Amy Schumer she's funny.
bill sweetie im gonna get you outta there  also ezra god you deserve so much better
No the John cena scene didn’t make me uncomfortable 🤥
what a solid film dude i loved bill hader's sarcastic humor honestly what a fave i just fell more in love with him in this film also holy shit what a stacked cast??? like every new scene i'm like dudeee thats a famous person but i can't remember their name but i know they're famous
This is not a total trainwreck. I kind of enjoyed it. Trainwreck is at its best when it sticks to its narrative of a troubled woman, who despite her efforts, falls in love and starts an exclusive relationship. The movie is further strengthened by the chemistry between its stars. It manages to avoid or change some of the troops associated with the genre but is unable for some of them. I personally found the humor cringy at times. Ultimately, I think its worth a watch.
I'm not a fan of Amy Schumer, I find her loud and obnoxious and just 'unfunny.'
Acting: 3/5 Cinematography: 2/5 Editing: .5/5 Comedy: 2/5 ____________________________ Biggest problem is the lack of focus and terrible pacing (not helped by the horrible editing. Best thing is Bill Hader's performance.
Another in a long line of movies that worked more for me the first time. I still like it, but I didn't remember it being nearly this raunchy or long. The Cena stuff still killed me though.
Had more fun with the first half than I was expecting, but the Apatow formula has definitely wore thin. The 2+ hour runtimes of endless isolated single shot riffs has been tired for awhile, but his forced descent into mean, Real Drama really seems trying and almost spiteful to his audiences. The second half is so hateful and prolonged that you really feel that Apatow would rather you suffer the pain of a life of regrets than enjoy the triumph of two people, with all their messy human baggage finding a way to still somehow make life worthwhile. He's hated his audiences since FUNNY PEOPLE, it's time to hate him back.
I literally like everyone in this movie EXCEPT Amy Schumer. I like the joke about how cheap Lebron James is.
title checks out
A meandering dramedy, with so many unconnected scenes that it has no business being this long. There are many obvious, boring single-character shots to allow for maximum riffing. The leads are pretty good, but you have to suspend disbelief a bit when this tries to be serious. This is a surprisingly raunchy movie considering the story it's trying to tell, and almost none of those jokes landed for me. There are some offensive jokes this shouldn't be telling, which it tries to get away with by having them told by offensive or clueless characters annnnnd nope. LeBron and Cena are very funny though, in the grand tradition of giving the best jokes in female-centered comedies to men. Schumer also has some excellent deadpan line readings. This has its moments as both a drama and a comedy but you have to sift through a lot of meh to find them.
Sporadically, some really good stuff, but that age old critique of Apatow (in need of a good edit) is more applicable to Trainwreck than any of his other work. There’s a great 90 minute movie in here somewhere. The scene with Marv Albert, Chris Evert & Matthew Broderick is crime against film.
Where is Lebron’s Oscar
Goddammit, this is the second movie I watched in a row that lost its steam at the halfway point. The conflict was contrived; its source came from out of the blue because there hadn't been any evidence of the instigator exhibiting that kind of behaviour up until that moment. The ending and Amy's arc neither meshed with the movie's tone nor felt organic. Aaron and LeBron's scenes together elicited the most laughs from me.
Lebron and Bill Hader are good.
the only decent thing about this film is lebron james
The only time I really laughed was when LeBron quoted “Gold Digger”.
Lebron was the best actor
functioning, logical brain: amy schumer has said a lot of problematic things in the past and i shouldn't support her by watching this movie dumbass human brain: hhnngh bill hader Hot
I could now confirm that I am not an Amy Schumer fan, and that I do not want to see John Cena's butt ever again. It hits close to home despite the cringe seizures I went through, but this is Not My Kind of Funny. Oh hey, there's a working title for that next Amy Schumer project. Two stars, but I'm adding that special half-star for Bill Hader, because what a dreamboat. Let me add him to my list of RomCom Prince Charmings, right next to Paul Rudd in Clueless.
Brie Larson and Bill Hader did nothing to deserve this. Unsurprisingly, they are the best part. That funeral scene was pretty good, too.
Tilda Swinton and Brie Larson are too good for this.  Amy Schumer isn’t funny.
WTF, why are people hating on this film so much? its a perfectly fine film. Brie Larson is really good here.
So close to giving this four stars, but I do find it a touch overlong. I've watched it twice, and still laughed out loud on numerous occasions on the second viewing. Much better than the recent I Feel Pretty, hopefully Schumer returns to this form again soon.
I didn't end up hating this as much as I expected and I thought the ending was really cute, but overall, didn't super love it either. That said, LeBron James was HILARIOUS and I need Bill Hader as a romantic lead in movies far more often. Also, that fake movie with Marisa Tomei and Daniel Radcliffe needs to be real like now.
Not the greatest of Apatow's movies, but Trainwreck had its moments. Best parts were the scenes with Bill Hader and Lebron James.
The moment I started to see the movie I understood WHY I'm so late in seeing it.
The biggest sin this movie committed was giving Tilda Swinton a bad tan.  Not the most memorable rom-com out there but I had a good enough time watching it. I loved the entire cast and they were a lot of fun to watch. Tilda Swinton has such dynamic range, she nails the comedy in this! There's a drunk attempted sex scene with Ezra Miller and I found it hilarious. Lastly, Lebron James wasn't that bad in this.
Would have rather had a buddy comedy based around Lebron and Bill Haders characters
john cena's minecraft ass
I kinda hate myself a little that I don't hate this.
1) i'm glad i waited to watch this until i was super into bill hader otherwise i would have turned this film off as soon as i saw john cena's bare fucking ass 2) this film would be miles better if it let itself be earnest!! it would have such a sweet scene and then suddenly do a 180 and then i was watching ezra miller call amy schumer daddy and snort cocaine off her forehead 3) tilda swinton was so bad in this i'm convinced she's actually never been good 4) i'll be thinking about that sex scene with bill hader for a while the end
every time I watch this movie I’m even more convinced that dr aaron conners is the love of my life
It could have been better!
The things I do for Bill Hader
Better than I thought it was going to be. 7/10!
Would be better if Bill Hader had played his character from Hot Rod instead
Huge Judd Apatow fan. Not his best work. Okay at most, I think I just dont like Amy Schumer.
i only rewatched the first five minutes of this movie bc i didn’t remember what was brie doing here someone get her out!!!!!
it's all about commitment, right?
It's mildly entertaining if not completely hammer smashing on the nose. It's an easy watch on a sunday morning when thinking isn't the prime objective.
Sentence I never thought I'd write: Lebron James was fucking funny.
aaron conners really is my dream man i'm in love
This could have been like 50 minutes shorter, and also not dogshit.
i'm exactly six minutes into this film and i'm sure this is the rating it deserves
There are so many great things about this movie. Lebron, against all odds, is probably the best part about it. There are very few scenes I’ve ever laughed during as much as the restaurant scene and the basketball scene (where he talks to Amy). John Cena is also surprisingly great as well. Bill Hader is perfect as the lead, Brie Larson, despite a jarringly quick transformation from the hot high school chick (2012’s 21 Jump Street and 2013’s The Spectacular Now) to a late 20’s mom-to-be, is still great. And at the center of all of this, there’s the always untalented Amy Schumer, fucking up what could’ve been a future classic.
There was A LOT I didn't like about this movie. It's not even that funny and some of these unbearable scenes go on for way too long. Amy Schumer is super annoying in this which shouldn't come as a surprise. There are times too where we are given the laziest reasons for the plot to continue/change... And the end was cringe.
brie larson is an angel on this earth if there ever was one
Watched this for probably the 6th time today. A near perfect rom com with a little bit of a pacing issue. Bill Hader’s character is my dream man. LeBron needs to be in more movies. Brie Larson is an ANGEL.
This one arrived a few years ago already beset by the baggage of indifference: how could this be anything other than a Hudson/Day picture with the genders reversed and the dirty talk emancipated from the subtext? Now that I've finally gotten around to it, I can confirm that Trainwreck is exactly that, never rising above it and sometimes falling well below. But it is also - maybe just as predictably - sometimes very funny with flashes of disarming poignancy. First, the bad: in classic Apatovian fashion, it's about 20-30 minutes too long; as usual you get the sense that the comedy auteur sees himself as some kind of raunchy James L. Brooks, indulging dramatic detours and logorrhea in the interest of narrative depth. The problem is Apatow's faith in formulas, an affliction Schumer (who wrote the screenplay) shares. Even when it works to engage our sense of shared humanity, the film's detailing can only let us down: the characters can never really surprise us and after a while we grow restless as Trainwreck delays the inevitable. The film's normativity is especially disappointing when we move from the aesthetic to the political. Yes, Amy's hedonism is affirmed as a feminist rejoinder to our culture's ongoing Madonna/whore complex, but it's ultimately still a sickness only monogamy can cure. Will we ever see a truly radical realism wherein rich, full, compassionate lives are lived free of romantic attachments and it's the need for commitment that's pathologized? But I realize this is a ridiculous demand to make of a film that, like its 50s forebears, ensconces its leads in aspirational fantasies of Manhattanite affluence and unabashedly tokenizes its few characters of color, laboring mightily under the illusion that cracking jokes about having black friends neutralizes any racial oversights (another affliction Apatow and Schumer share). But then, the good: Trainwreck is frequently hilarious. Schumer gets a lot of comic mileage out of the simple inversion of the sexually voracious woman steamrolling through hapless, smitten men, drawing some of her biggest laughs from the ingenue routine she uses to assuage her lovers' egos and get exactly what she wants ("You know what? I’m like really shy, so we should probably do this first till I feel comfortable with you," she tells one conquest as she guides his head to her crotch). These scenes, compiled into the film's first act, typify a balance of farce and realism that Apatow only occasionally achieves. It helps that he's very much an actor's director, with a particular talent for drawing complex performances from unlikely sources. John Cena, for one, is a revelation in early scenes as Schumer's sweet but lunkheaded main squeeze. He's a cartoon of gym rat hypermachismo, but when he realizes his investment in the relationship far outpaces Schumer's, his heartbreak is rather stunningly convincing. (He also delivers a monologue describing the life he imagined for them together which, in its unabashed desire to fit Amy into a predetermined role, represents the film's all-too-brief exploration of the self-absorbed and delusional side of monogamous desire.) Colin Quinn is also effective as Schumer's scabrous, MS-stricken father - perhaps less surprising, considering Quinn's stage persona as a tristate blowhard - especially when using his daughters' dolls to explain his separation from their mother (a scene that is gut-bustingly funny until, as is so often the case, Apatow and Schumer hammer their point home, with Quinn leading his children in a mantra: "Monogamy isn't realistic!"). For her part, Schumer is best in the subtler moments between shtick and mawkishness. The offhand confidence with which she seduces Bill Hader's Aaron for the first time is almost scarily convincing. (Or, maybe I've just encountered too many Amy's of my own.) Far less convincing is the choreographed dance routine (and slapstick switcheroo) that ends the film, with Billy Joel's "Uptown Girl" no less - a sentimental touch I don't know if I could ever forgive.
Schumer’s script is amusing but too conventional. She is frequently upstaged by her supporting cast (e.g. James, Lena, Hader, etc).
did it for bill. laughed with john cena. stayed for lebron.
did I thirst watch a movie for Bill Hader? who’s to say
i really cant stand amy schumer but this was ok i guess
Brie Larson, the ray of sunshine in this weird ass world.
Some of the humor becomes a trainwreck, Bill Hader is under-utilized, but for the most part the movie works.
this was one of the worst movies i’ve ever seen amy schumer is not funny
The only thing I remember about this movie is that on the way to the theater I unintentionally egged on a fight between the couple I was sharing a Lyft with
Could have been wreckier. And funnier. And less long. Oh right, Judd Apatow. Shoulda known. John Cena's naked body looks like a photoshopped poster my sister made when we were teens for a made up Matthew Broderick porno... who has a cameo in this. Huh.
Exaggerated! Just a normal love story.
"I just want you to know, my safe word is 'pineapple'."  Trainwreck is an ok movie by Judd Apatow. It was too long in my opinion and it would have benefited if it had been shorter. Bill Hader was great though and Amy Schumer wasn't as annoying as I thought she'd be.
- Lots of laughs - John Cena and Lebron James were in it, and both were hilarious
It's 12am, boyfriend is trying to convince me to watch a bad horror movie. I say no, he insists. I say OKAY, he decides nothing on Netflix is bad enough. Enter Trainwreck. I honestly don't know how this happened, I dislike Amy Schumer as much as the next person.  Two years ago I tried to watch this on a plane but the first 5 minutes drove me away so I watched Mad Max instead. You see, in this day and age I can tolerate bad movies (THE KISSING BOOTH) because I actually laugh at how horrible they are (THE KISSING BOOTH) still, I never thought I'd be watching this AND realizing it's not bad.
Well...that certainly felt like a Judd Apatow movie. I'll say this - John Cena, and Lebron James were pretty funny. I can only care so much about whether privileged rich people want to have a 'conventional' relationship or not though, and this goes about 30-40 minutes past where that line is for me. Amy Schumer and Bill Hader were fine. Nice to see a Claudia O'Doherty cameo, and Colin Quinn is a great scumbag Dad. Also....um...I forgot everything else about this movie mid-review.
How random is Lebron in this movie? Funny. Witty. Love Amy.
Trainwreck is a trainwreck.
ANYWAY..... I just know that Bill Hader would treat me right!!!
I don't enjoy watching Amy Schumer, but despite that I do enjoy this movie.
you pathetic childless milf
that one star is for brie larson, ezra miller and bill hader the half star is for that movie they were watching in the cinema that had daniel radcliffe and marisa tomei in it
I really miss 90 minutes comedies, but I can't complain about that in an Apatow movie since this feeling of exaustion is part of his project as a filmmaker. Not that it works for me (comedy is about tight pacing), but I respect that. That said, can we have a spin-off about Tilda Swinton's character?
straight nonsense feat. amy schumer
Observations: - Tilda Swinton was unrecognizable  - John Cena naked was disturbing  - John Cena & Amy Schumer was ... something - Bill Hader looks kinda good? - LeBron James? Alright, didn’t see that coming - Ezra Miller & Amy was ... something .. too - Ezra Miller is still THE man - Brie Larson is such a babe - Pretty decent movie  Many thoughts processing ...
it wasn’t the worst thing i’ve ever seen but tbh i just watched for bill hader amy schumer is a fucking demon. she’s not funny in this movie and her improv-y moments are nauseating lmao. that being said, bill hader has great comedic timing and so does lebron james weirdly enough??? their relationship was kinda cute so i’ll give it that. and yeah i’d die for bill hader thnx for coming to my ted talk
Bill Hader is fucking hot. Fight me.  I’m a huge sap, and the final scene gets me every time.
Tilda Swinton is so fucking good in this
The first third of this movie was jokes about sex, then Lebron came in. Bill Hader was good but the script, plot, and really everything about this movie was not. So many parts of this movie didn’t matter, including her dad dying. For a 2hr watch, you’d expect more.
god i hate this movie so much but bill looks so good, the duality of a film
A typical flick and what I expected
I’m even more in love with bill and I didn’t think that was possible
movie name is accurate
i'm so pissed about the fact that i find bill hader hot now
Boring, not very funny, not even that bad in the sense of being raunchy. Probably wouldn't watch again
Lebron is the GOAT.
LeBron and Cena are the best parts of this movie. Hader of course is lovable and great. Amy Schumer is even pretty funny in this. Maybe not as good as it was heralded but still good.
I liked when she was in the movie theatre drinking out of 2 boxes of wine, because I too was in the theatre drinking out of 2 boxes of wine.
Extra points for bill hader... the love of my life
6.0 /10 Watched this because Judd Apatow's other movie Knocked Up is awesome and because I really like Bill Hader and some of the other actors in this. It's alright. The first 20-30 minutes are really funny, but then the film becomes a mix of funny and serious scenes and that makes it kinda boring in some scenes. ( Don't understand me wrong, the movie is still enjoyable. ) The final minutes are really good again. Overall Trainwreck could have been better, but at least it's enjoyable and likeable.
Every Judd Apatow movie is thirty minutes too long. There’s a scene wherein one joke is essentially repeated several times with different wording (the group hug scene), and Apatow leaves it all in there. Just pick one, man. Cut some stuff. Hader’s great, Larson’s great, Colin Quinn is great, but there isn’t very much to cling to in this fun but otherwise disposable rom-com.
Damnit Amy Schumer is in cool interesting character driven quiet drama romances that make me laugh and showcase fun, flawed women who change! I enjoy!
Aside from the reversal of gender roles, this was a fairly straightforward rom-com. Amy Schumer was very funny, but it couldn't quite carry the film.
Judd Apatow and Amy Schumer's "Trainwreck" will surprise audiences in a plethora of ways. First, who knew Amy Schumer could successfully utilize her raunchy style of comedy for a story that not only has a lot of intelligent humor but also a lot heart with a deep message?! Who knew that they were actually going to cry during this?! Who knew that Bill Hader and Amy Schumer would work as a convincing pair of charming romantic leads?! And who knew that Colin Quinn, John Cena and Lebron James were good comedic actors?! "Trainwreck" is easily one of my favorites of 2015 with a story about a kind of woman that Amy Schumer gives a genuine insight into and pulls it off with an outstanding, yet unlikely cast.
Amy Schumer is a comedy assassin. Proof is in her hit Comedy Central series, Inside Amy Schumer, which takes on everything from rape culture to Hollywood sexism to Bill Cosby. Proof is also now in her starring role in Trainwreck. As star and screenwriter–with director Judd Apatow wisely harnessing her comic skills instead of stifling them–Schumer is a wonder of comic talent with an assault on sexism and man attitudes that hits hard. Amy is Amy Townend, a writer for a men’s magazine run by an editor (a terrifically hilarious Tilda Swinton) who has a fondness for headlines such as ‘Are You Gay Or Is She Just Boring?’ Amy is tasked with interviewing Aaron Conners (Bill Hader), a sports-medicine doctor who tends to the celebrity likes of LeBron James (absolutely hilarious) and Amar’e Stoudemire. Sounds like a set-up for love, but hang on. Amy, sporting a mouth fueled by booze, weed and a clueless, neglectful father (a wonderful Colin Quinn) is game to hook up with almost any guy and then dump them. Aaron isn’t quite one of those dudes, though the brilliant Hader, whose comic and dramatic skills hit a new peak, imbues him with complications. These two don’t go together easy, and that’s how Schumer likes it. Schumer takes rom-com cliches and explodes them, replacing them with something fierce and tougher. Here’s to getting more of that from her.
just kinda survived through this for bill
Like 5 mins into the movie Amy and her friend are talking about which version of Johnny Depp they would have sex with, so real fast I knew I wasn’t the targeted demographic of this movie  (Brie Larson I love you to death but please don’t even make me watch something like that ever again)
I legit just watched this for Judd Apatow, Brie, Bill and the two seconds of Leslie Jones and Pete Davidson
Okay, I’m not really a big Amy Schumer fan. And the first half of this film she is so unlikeable, like I actually wanted to slap her and tell her to shut up!  Brie Larson is queen though! And bill header! I’ve never really seen any of his films but he really stood out in this film.  Ezra miller was a nice surprise too, he’s just gorgeous!  A nice little film. That last scene with the dancing made the whole film better for me!  Oh and what’s up with tilda swinton in this! Haha she looks so different!
I caught a bit of this on TV just kind of coincidentally and it was at the argument between Amy and Brie Larson at the funeral. It seems like a scene out of a fake movie that characters in a real movie would watch. I had a physical reaction to Amy keeping Bill Harder’s character up to argue the night before his big surgery. Fuck this movie. Fuck this movie so much.  Fuck Amy Schumer.
"Oohhh my boi got intimate, sexual intercourse" Lebron James and John Cena forcing me to rewind every scene they're in made this a damn near 3 hour experience. I'm not the biggest fan of Amy schumer but she made a really funny movie with a magical ensemble cast. I still hate that ending though  "I'm gonna give you my full pecker"
"I once fucked three-quarters of Pink Floyd. Yeah. Dark Side of ALL their moons." The cameos and the supporting cast are really the best part of this movie. Also, 129 minutes is about 30-40 minutes longer than what this film should've been.
Bill Hader cant not be funny cmon guys
I am a fan of Judd Apatow and Amy Schumer, but I was not a huge fan of this film. It had funny parts, but overall I found the main character to be too unlikable for me to really empathize with her. I probably won't watch it again.
First half was much better than the last. Tilda Swinton baffled me- I didn’t even clock that it was her and I’m glad I finally found out where those photos of Daniel Radcliffe and the dogs came from.
One star for Jimmy Stewart as a stalker. One star for Kim Novak’s dual roles.  One star for Alfred Hitchcock’s direction.  But the real two stars are Robert Burke’s gorgeous photography and Bernard Herrmann’s haunting score.
I was thinking about how I’ve never seen jimmy stewart play a villain. While most probably wouldn’t consider him such in vertigo, I mostly see him as a tragic and manipulative creep. Though of course he himself was manipulated. I can’t shake his callousness towards Midge. Novak’s dynamic performance is quite astounding, and I cant justify her death, didn’t seem to be a narrative necessity - one of the many markers of sexism rife throughout this movie. Dated? Most definitely. Masterpiece? I can see the argument.
"If I let you change me, will that do it? If I do what you tell me, will you love me?"
here was a tremendous amount of worry that the hype of this film would kill the ultimate effect of watching it. These worries proved to be unfounded. Nothing I can say can describe this appropriately. I'm not even sure what it is, but we just felt it. The film builds, and Hitchcock already a master of long set up, allows for the uncomfortable and unusual to to simmer. Just eerie feelings crawl along your spine throughout, and it only gets creepier as it becomes more obsessive. It's a picture perfect film with ultimately no release, abandon your belief in resolution, you won't find it here.
I screened Vertigo for a big group of friends and this thing, I kid you not, put every single one of ‘em to sleep. Out cold. And I know what you’re gonna say: “C-dog, you need to get yourself some new friends,” and you’re probably right, but you know what? I gotta say, this film isn’t as accessible as I remember. Look, I love Vertigo. People like us all do. There’s just something about the way it feels that really gets our motors purring. That rich VistaVision. Herrmann’s sumptuous score (in my opinion, the greatest achievement of his brilliant career). Stewart’s uncharacteristically demented performance. The haunting, dreamlike spell that permeates nearly every frame. The film is a technical wonder, practically unrivalled. We all know this. But when was the last time you watched Sight & Sound’s Greatest Film of All Time® with a bunch of normies? I’m not talking about some arthouse retrospective with like-minded cinephiles, or an in-the-mood, masturbatory solo viewing, I mean normal people, that is to say, people who couldn’t give two shits about dolly zooms, mise-en-scene, or idealogical editing. Watching this with the pressure of a casual audience, trying to defend the film’s goofier aspects, is an exhausting experience, let me tell you. The abominable way women are treated, that ridiculous stepping stool scene, the awkward blocking of Stewart’s hilariously inept shadowing, the abundance of lousy rear projection, the pathetic suicide attempt into the bay, Midge’s lopsided arc (which could’ve been tidily wrapped up if it had been her at the tower instead of some random nun), all the way through to that (and I’m sorry to have to put it this way, but) just-plain-stupid final scene. Go ahead. Skip ahead to that final minute and look me in the eyes and tell me that works for you. Honestly, I was kinda glad no one else was awake to see it!  And speaking of honesty, can we all just admit that it never quite plunges into the dark psychological depths its champions proclaim? Hitch is painting with pretty broad strokes as far as actual medical science is concerned. Sure, there are some interesting themes dealing with possession, guilt, lust, artificiality, etc., and you could analyze them to high hell (as every armchair-psychologist film critic has), but beyond the masterful way these elements are utilized to craft beautifully-staged cinematic sequences, I don’t think you’ll find a chapter dedicated to Vertigo in any clinical texts. Anyway, I guess what it all boils down to is this: the next time I host a Hitchcock screening, we’re watching The Birds. It may not be Hitch’s finest hour, but it sure as hell won’t put ‘em all to sleep.
It’s amazing, sure, but I cannot get past the opening sequence with his face and all the trippy colours.
Alfred Hitchcock's Vertigo is a timeless classic. It has a fantastic script, that tells a great story, with some excellent twists and turns. The great James Stewart puts in some very strong work in the lead role and Kim Novak is really good too. The sets deign is another plus and the cinematography is excellent. It also has one of the all time great scores, courtesy of Bernard Herrmann. 9/10
You know, the Chinese say that once you've saved a person's life, you're responsible for it forever.  Beautifuly crafted Film everything acting, directing, camera movements and the amazing camera shots just amazing. This film almost got a 5/5 but the ending ruined it for me. If Alfred ended the Film where she changed her clothes in the Empire Hotel apartment and then she and Scottie kissed that wouldve been better but i do see why he did not end it there to show the audience that he Scottie finally faced and defeated his fear of Heights aka Acrophobia and the gulit that was within him bout Madeleine death. But if he did actually end it at the Empire Hotel that wouldve been Beautifuly-Fucked up both of em living a lie but a beautiful one.
on the more enjoyable end of movies before the 60s!
Enough has been said about this film, but I still find new things every time I watch it. Richness. Mystery. San Francisco. Characters and traumas tied to places. Ghosts. Production design. Kim Novak is so good.
The tragedy of Vertigo is that, for all its strength in theme, it is still crippled by Hitchcock's adherence to parlor tricks and poor handling of emotion. Alfred is famously quoted as saying "actors should be treated like cattle," but one needn't watch more than a few of his films to realize that when he says "actors" he means "people." Characters, storytelling, audience responses, even the human soul are all subsumed into a kind of press that turns everything two-dimensional. This is all well and good, but if people are going to behave like machines, they need to be extraordinary machines, with exaggerated, caricaturesque aspects to offset their unreality. They should be supernormal as opposed to subnormal. Everything in Vertigo, beyond its surface, is quite subnormal. Characters are constantly telling you little more than what is happening on screen; they fall in love and off buildings due to contrivances; they have no real backstories; they are only chess pieces but not even interesting ones. "Well," one might say, "but that is the point! Hitchcock captures how everything, right down to our very relations, has been steamrolled into artifice, and we are left with nothing but our reamed-out biological vestiges to make sense of anything now!" and they would be right. The issue is not with Vertigo's themes nor anything adjacent, but in the deployment of said themes. That all the meaning in your life could be trompe-l'œil is not well communicated by the fact most of the meaning in the film is itself a diegetic trompe-l'œil, a kind of petty, plotted conceit that had little to do with the themes at heart here. Hallucinations can be medicated, illusions dispelled, but the greatest mirage of all, that life could be somehow meaningful and there are people in it whom you can save, is far better illustrated in the film's first half than its second, where its shallowness and lameness are fully disrobed. Falling in love with the vessel of a dead woman, whilst the soul of the living woman whose body you are in love with is inaccessible to you, is an infinitely more damning illustration of life because it elevates the deception to an ontological level, rather than a mere scam enacted for money, a further artifice and cynical metaphor for cinema. This is not to say fraud as a plot device should have been forgone entirely, but it should not have been the linchpin of the story. Why even have Scottie Ferguson fall so deeply in love with this simulacrum of a deathly and possessed woman if he only needed to witness her simulated dying? That sort of malevolence is characteristic of a real puppetmaster, a regular Cartesian demon, not a man merely after money who was willing to sacrifice all of two whole lives to get it. Murderous husbands cannot stand in compellingly for God, nor can directors. Vertigo, like all Hitchcock films, falls short because the fat man never had much to do with the sublime. That he is a sacred cow of cinema is kind of a shame really.  Edit: Yet for all its flaws Vertigo could have been truly spectacular. It just needed more open ends, better development, and less meta. Indeed, the film could have been entirely saved by the removal or alteration of just a few story beats, namely the letter writing scene, the reveal of the con, and the revelations at the end. The former two are not even experienced by Scottie and are thus somewhat close to cinematic lies. So much more depth could have been added by the entire scam being ambiguously real, the possession of Madeline by Carlotta being ambiguously real, and the possession of Judy by Madeline being ambiguously real. Vertigo could have inhabited an entire world of its own without much editing, but instead it stopped spinning on a dry note. Alas, Hitchcock thought we were all cattle, and perhaps he was right, but mostly about his most ardent fans. 1.5 - 2.5
i watched this when i was in an exceptionally high feminist mood (as i always am) so yeaaa scotty what the fu
The plot twist was cool. I was very bored for the first hour though and kind of want to slap almost every character in the film. Also why are the men so old and their female counterparts so young? Wait don’t answer that.
I'm giving this 5 stars even though Hermans score ends on this weirdly abrupt major chord that makes me laugh every time I see this movie
Oh she’s a classic
I'll get so much shit for this
that little "sentimental" jab was such a slap to her face..
95% Watching this with three separate classes of teenagers, 60 yeas after its release makes for an interesting experience. Breaking it up and watching it in thirds, three times in a row makes it even stranger. And still, while the students were thoroughly engaged the entire time and MAD at the ending, it was probably the most fun I've had watching it. Three times at once, in 45 minute intervals. The faces they made as epiphanies started happening around the room were priceless. And it brought up a lot of life lessons I could impart on the girls in the class, as a parent of girls myself. So yeah, mission accomplished. Before you ask, we watched it in photography class for our color theory section.
Wow. Goes from a suspense thriller with a hint of the supernatural to a psychological survival drama to whodunit and further on to an intense love story. The woman can't help herself but go against her better sense, to be loved again. It was an accident then but she can't resist it now. She caves in to all of his what should've been eccentric requests. All this and she ends up dying at the same spot. Tragedy to top it all off. Phew! And I loved the portrayal of the relationship between Midge and Jhonny. From "don't be so motherly" to "mother's here". I don't think I have seen anything like their equation in films I've encountered so far. The only thing that annoyed me was the excessive usage of musical scores. Doesn't give you the space to immersive yourself and thereby made it seemed longer than it was.
good visuals, good score, good drama/tension, a little sexist
Not as strong on re-watch, but still slaps.
John "Scottie" Ferguson is a San Francisco cop who decides to quit the service after his acrophobia results in him being unable to save the life of a colleague. Whilst taking it easy he gets a call from an old school friend, Gavin Elster, asking him if he wouldn't mind doing a little bit of detective work for him. The job is simply to tail his wife because she's obsessed with an ancestress who committed suicide, and the wife, Madeline, is showing signs of herself being suicidal. Ferguson tails her diligently and as the tail progresses, Ferguson himself starts to become ever obsessed about the demur blonde Madeline. As the story twists and turns, Ferguson's obsession will have far reaching consequences for both parties... Vertigo is Alfred Hitchcock's most discussed, dissected and critically reappraised film, based on a novel by Pierre Boileau called D'Entre Les Morts, (also writer of Diabolique), Vertigo was not well liked on its release and unable to be viewed for some time due to copyright, the film was restored from a destroyed negative into a glorious 70mm print, and now in all its glory it can be seen as one of the greatest films to have ever been made. What is most striking about Vertigo, outside of Hitchcock baring his innermost that is, is that its plot on the surface is simplicity personified, but delving deeper, and repeat viewings are a necessity, its apparent that Vertigo is a chilling force of cinema, taking great delight in gnawing away at your perceptions, perhaps even your own capabilities as a human being. Very much a film of two great halves, Vertigo first seems intent on being an almost ghost story like mystery. Once the prologue has introduced us to Ferguson's fear of heights, we then enter an almost dream like sequence of events as Ferguson tails the troubled Madeline, the suggestion of reincarnation bleakly leading to death hangs heavy as Hitchcock pulls his atmospheric strings. Then the film shifts into dark territory as obsessions and nods to Dante's Inferno and feverish dreams take control, Hitchcock, as we have come to learn over the years, lays out his soul for us the audience to partake in, the uneasy traits sitting side by side with fascination of the story. All of which is leading us to a spine tingling finale that is as hauntingly memorable as it is shocking, the end to our own dizzying journey that Alfred and his team have taken us on. Technically the film is magnificent, the opening credits from Saul Bass brilliantly prep us for what is about to unfold, while Bernard Herrmann's score is as good as anything he ever did, unnerving one minute, swirlingly romantic the next, a truly incredible score. Hitchcock himself is firing from the top draw, introducing us to the brilliant zoom-forward-track-back camera technique to induce the feeling of Vertigo itself, with that merely a component of two hours of gorgeous texture lined with disturbing little peccadilloes. The two leads are arguably doing their respective career best work, James Stewart as Scottie Ferguson goes real deep to play it out with an edgy believability that decries his aw-shucks trademark of years since past. Kim Novak as Madeline is perhaps the quintessential Hitchcock blonde, perfect with the duality aspects of the role and playing off Stewart's ever creepy descent with seamlessly adroit skill. It however should be noted that Hitchcock and his loyal subjects had to work hard to get Novak right for the role, but the result proves that Novak had ability that sadly wasn't harnessed on too many other occasions. Vertigo is a film that I myself wasn't too taken with on my first viewing, it's only during revisits that the piece has come to grab me by the soul and refuse to let go, it not only holds up on revisits, it also gets better with each subsequent viewing, it is simply a film that demands to be seen as many times as possible. Not only one of the greatest American films ever made, one of the greatest films ever made...period, so invest your soul in it, just the way that Hitchcock himself so clearly did.
Probably one of the only people who feels this way but ehh
This might sound sacrilegious, but... Yes, it took me this long to finally see this Hitchcock classic. No, it was not exactly what it was cracked up to be. Hitchcock's expressionist use of film grammar contributes to several of the film's formal grace notes which continue to influence the art of image-making until this day. Definitely a respectable entry in the cinematic canon and the legendary auteur's ouvre, but not necessarily one I can bring myself to thoroughly enjoy.
Whoopsy I waited 22 years to watch this and still wasn’t ready!!!
there is something i must do
James Stewart feels like an amalgamation of the body of Fred Rogers and the americanized voice of Sean Connery. Bugged the shit out of me throughout the whole runtime. XD
Hitchcock generates a stunning air of mystery with 'Vertigo', coaxing brilliant performances from Stewart and Novak and using the location of San Francisco as almost a third leading "character" in his story. Stewart's obsession with Novak, and his descent into madness as he grieves over his inability to protect her, is brilliantly portrayed. As ever - in fact, more so than ever - Hitchcock keeps the audience off-balance with his disorientating camera work, ingenious plotting and atmospheric use of color. Bernard Herrmann contributes a haunting score (his fourth for Hitchcock) that heightens the passion and suspense even further. The solution when it comes is extremely clever, and proves (as if proof is needed) that Hitchcock has a masterful touch when it comes to clever plot twists. One of Hitchcock's finest.
i did enjoy this film but the romance towards the end felt wrong in many ways that made me feel a little odd
Obviously well shot and the plot was fabulous.
i put seeing this film off for so long, but i honestly don't know why. while extremely slow in the first act, hitchcock still manages to get me to this day with the goddamn twists.  and frankly, i'm impressed
Was Alfred Hitchcock just incapable of casting a brunette woman or is it just coincidence that all his leading ladies have very blonde, short hair?
A suspenseful Noir beautifully settled in San Francisco, which is boosted by that times' charming look and feeling while, underneath, covering a mysterious and thrilling search of a doubtful detective lingered in a world of superficiality, which in the end he also falls being guilty of.
Judy should have listened to Amy Dunne's advices instead of letting him turn her into a cool girl. Cool girl is hot, cool girl is game, cool girl is fun, cool girl never gets angry at her man but cool isn't supposed to die at the end.
Oh man, I was almost out of breath by the end. A true masterpiece!     p.s: Midge, sweetheart, let me give you a hug :(
Hitchcock’s best work, and it literally gets even better every time I watch it.
the perfect interwoven tale of twists, mystery, fear, and obsession; all set against the neon glow of the san francisco bay.  alfred hitchcock demonstrates complete cont mastery of his art. everything from the music to the lighting works together to create a film that grabs hold and doesn’t let go.  beginning from the opening title sequence visuals to the final minute. this story of deception and obsession is timeless hitchcockian suspense.
A perfect movie and quite possibly the greatest film of all time.
"I want to stop being haunted." Vertigo has haunted me since I first saw it a few years ago. It starts off as an excellent mystery film, then becomes one of the greatest films of all time.
'Greatest film of all time' The first half of the film consisted of uninteresting stalking where you as a viewer had a lot of questions, but never got any answers, so you just had to sit in your chair like an idiot waiting for something to happen. After that, it catches up and gets really good, but then it reaches the last act... Overall a really inconsistent film in my opinion.
A beauty from Hitchcock that is really rather twisted yet a delight to watch. The Blu Ray is gorgeous considering this movie is from 1958 and Jimmy Stewart is a delight as always.
In a nutshell: James Stewart playing a stalker for the 100th time. I think I see a pattern here.
"Mere color, unspoiled by meaning, and unallied with definite form, can speak to the soul in a thousand different ways." - Oscar Wilde
Glad to have ticked this off on the required viewing list and I see why this is considered as important and obviously recognize the aspects that are referenced over and over in many films that came after this, but the first 3/4 are drawn out and drag on as hell and the ending is stupid. Sure, the last quarter gets across the whole point this is worth watching for quite well, but is the gender commentary really meta enough to compensate for how women are depicted and treated in this film? Still seems like the only older films I can really get into are from the 60s.
First watched this at about 15 when i was just getting into film and didn't really enjoy it very much however on a re-watch it was much more enjoyable this time. Very uncomfortable watch especially towards then end with James stweart treatment of Jullie, movie needed more michelle as she did just sorta disappear towards the end but i guess she also moved on after realizing that James didn't want anything to do with her. Which was probably the best for her
james stewart talked like that cuz he had no upper lip
Alright Hitchcock, you've got my attention.
Nothing bad would have happened if Bono had been around.
What a movie! Hitchcock really is the master of suspense. It is a slow burn of a story and yet it manages to confuse you a lot in order to believe every possible outcome. The performances are yet again exceptional but the plot is so complicated. You actually come to a point where you are not sure what to make out of it, everything seems possible, until you come to the conclusion and everything is explained. And the fact is you accept the explanation, because it makes absolute sense. Hitchcock has woven this story in such a way, where you can't possibly defy it. "Vertigo" feels quite long sometimes, but it's so much rewarding by the end. I think I'm gonna love the Hitchcock filmography!
Bernard Herrmann be like: "lemme just craft the greatest Hitchcock score of all time just to flex on the haters"  Appreciated it a little more this time around but still overrated af though.
Hitchcock is simply one of those directors whose work is riddled with authorial design. It’s the opening sequences, the mirrors and the eyes, Bernard Herrmann and (most importantly) stunning blonde-leads. Seeing as this is the second time I’ve actually seen this film, admittedly the first being a long time ago now, I want to steer away from the things I like about the movie and try and work on the things I didn’t. I’m no academic on Hitchcock’s work - so I think it’s best to leave the appraisals to those who know better. TLDR; it really hasn’t aged well. The quality and aspect ratio (admittedly, it could have been down to the airplane entertainment-screen version) really bugged me seeing as the DP (Robert Burks) has created some amazing frames throughout. Perhaps the reworked criterion collection version is more visually pleasing as this is a big part of what makes Hitchcock a masterful film maker. A lot of the dialogue was so detached from empirical life, or seeping with masculinity, that it hurt to watch. This is incredibly obvious in the sequences shared in the second half of the film where Judy is a one-dimensional, subdued and bordering on idiotic version of the brooding, mysterious and sexy Kim Novak we see in the beginning. Similarly, the psyche of the characters seemed to be less clear and cohesive as people often praise them to be. The thematic ideas of this screen adaptation are so interesting and could function at a more accessible level for viewers if the character developments weren’t so erratic or their decisions seemingly unbelievable at times. Retrospectively, this may be the entire idea behind it - and Vertigo is a film worth watching over and over to find more within the subtext and subtlety. In the case of my last viewing, I wish these could have been portrayed in a stronger sense that rings true with the narratives intentions. For the simple reason of it being a Hitchcock film should not denote it as a masterpiece. Like any artist, time can ultimately damage the impact of a work - leaving behind a superlative zeitgeist to linger within the frame. That isn’t to say the Sistine Chapel isn’t as beautiful as the photograph or even that technology begets the value of a film, in the case of Vertigo and its place in the 21st century mediascape - it must be a point of both influence and reference as it should remain a historic (and now passed) moment in Hollywood cinema. PART OF THE AIRPLANE MOVIE MARATHON - NOVEMBER 26 2018
Best film of all time. Multiple viewings needed as applying critical frameworks and theory help understand the film on a psychoanalitical level.
This is a very accomplished piece of work, with a great Jimmy Stewart performance as well as one of Bernard Herrmann's best musical scores. I've always liked the dreamlike quality that the film has, particularly in how atmospheric the whole thing feels. Having said all of that, I've never quite understood the modern critical opinion of this being the greatest movie of all time. It's not even my favorite Hitchcock movie; that title would go to North by Northwest.
The colors and light are amazing. The early exchanges between Scottie and Madeleine are simply electric. Kim Novak is 🔥🔥. It went really weird in the third act, maybe one of the most disturbing romances ever (which if it were released today, would be very problematic in this #MeToo climate). But the ending was satisfying and kinda made up for the weird stuff that happened before. Kept me engaged at all times though. Confession: I thought this would be a thriller on a skyscraper like what if John McClane was scared of heights. I am dumb.
It’s still a solid film from Hitchcock but man does it drag its feet. The beauty of the rest of it makes up for it mostly but geez.
Really liked this one. Despite not particularly enjoying parts of it and questioning some of the events that transpired, I can’t deny how well made it was. How mesmerizing it was. I must say, from a first viewing, I enjoyed Rear Window a whole lot more. But this certainly evoked different emotions ranging from enjoyment, confusion, frustration, and shock. So, that sure is something.
a constant battle of me trying to view this in a historical context vs me getting sick at the thought of how women are treated on screen
60 years after the film was released, and I can only name two films that have come out since, that are better than vertigo.
Wow the score is easily the best thing about this film, it’s fantastic and dramatic and I don’t think I would have been able to sit through this without it. The cinematography is lovely and all, but all in all this film is certainly a lot to just sit through. Slow paced and suspenseful, but seeing it for the second time took away some of the surprise and excitement that made it so memorable the first time. Also forgot how much of a complete asshat John is wow he kinda sucked for a lot of it... making Judy change just for his own selfishness and she was so in love she just let him... that shit hurted
I was lucky enough to catch this in the theatre for its anniversary. I am aware of its reputation and was excited for the experience. Im slightly dissatisfied with the end result.       From the opening credits I was immediately intrigued, and my excitement only increased from this. What followed was a grest first act, an even better second, then an awful third.      I loved an immense amount of this film. James Stewart and Kim Novak are fantastic, and I especially loved Barbara Geddes. The cinematography while simple was beautiful, and the score is absolutely brilliant. The first and second act are near perfect, with only the slightly inconsistent tone and the annoying overuse of fade-outs weighing it down.      Then the film looses itself and decides to go in another direction. The third act is tedious and bafflingly disappointing. It somehow manages to make the small two hour running time feal twice its length. It’s boring, anticlimactic, and quite frankly unimpressive. The build up was so well written, but the ending chosen is a burden on the general picture that frankly ruins the otherwise great movie.       I wish the film had gone in another direction, and I am disappointed with the results of the path Hitchcock took.
I just can't believe you could go to a movie like that 60 years ago.
Everything that has been said about the sequence where Scottie follows (stalks?) Madeleine is true. One of the most beautiful sequences ever put on film.
I'm just so drawn to the tension between Scottie's obsessive love and his sense of vindication, to the point where you can't tell which is which at a certain point. Though on this subsequent rewatch I'm even more sympathetic toward Judy, who seems to be fighting toward something genuinely noble even though she knows it's probably too late for her own salvation. A love that can never be is one of the great love stories of cinema, perhaps BECAUSE it can never be.
AFI SPECIAL ENGAGEMENT: 60th Anniversary, 4K Restoration.
One of the best of all time what more and else is there to say and also do
A love story laced with mystery and melancholy; much like the spirals that permeate the film, the narrative slowly but surely pulls you down its rabbit hole accompanied by Bernie Herrmann's spidery harps, and never loosens its grip. Kim Novak's performance, specially in the later stages of the film where inner conflict ensues, goes for a knockout; her counterpart James Stewart straddles the (for the time) fine lines between manliness and a vulnerability to acrophobia - and love. Behind the camera Hitch is on one of his finest moments - the pacing is deliberate and effective, the shots are often strikingly good both on an aesthetic sense, but also from a technical point of view. Things like a dolly shot around Stewart and Novak kissing, while two different settings behind them changed seamlessly had me delighted. Some funky blends of animation and special effect shots for dream sequences were also cool way beyond 1958, the year the film was released. The spirals in Saul Bass's amazing title sequence were even computer generated! Pretty sprightly for a 60 year old movie!
What an ending! Love the symbolism behind the film and the filmmaking is wonderful, classic Hitchcock.
that was an hour and a half of "this is good but it's no rear window" then a half hour of "oh fuck it's better"
that ending was the most hitchcock thing i’ve ever seen.
bored as shite........
A twisted tale of love wrapped in conspiracy, mystery, and psychosis in a style that only Hitchcock can deliver. What else is there to say that hasn't already been said?
“Only one is a wanderer; two together are always going somewhere.” Hitchcock never disappoints. James Stewart and Kim Novak give brilliant performances. An absolute must-see.
“You either die a hero, or live long enough to see yourself become the villain.”
Not my favorite Hitchcock.
3.31/5 Ah, now this film encompasses a plot twist that was way more exciting than The Crimes of Grindelwald. It was a little slow in the beginning, but overall it was a thrill to watch. I must say, however, that the last thirty seconds of the film really had me laughing when I really shouldn't have been.
A fantastically-directed, good-looking and largely well-performed film that wraps up with a finale that feels cheaper than everything that came before it. Hitchcock asserts his filmmaking mastery to terrific effect, crafting a film that feels both tense and surprising, elevated further by James Stewart and Kim Novak's performances.
woah such an amazing film. Hitchcock is amazing this story is crazy as is the ending. Pretty much blown away as I expected to be.
Everything about this movie is fucking brilliant. Just might be Hitchcock's best
Disappointed this rating won't be going up on a second viewing. Forgot how out of nowhere the ending is. I did appreciate the film in the context of Hitchcock's whole filmography this time around.
rewatched in lecture. and i actually liked it way less this time. this movie is too long. now if a movie requires the length to effective tell it's story, that's perfectly fine. even encouraged. but that's not the case here. it's bloated, too many stupid hamfisted scene that make the complex story seem oversimplified and dull. the plot was actually really interesting all throughout. but has way too many contrivances to forgive. that being said, the framing is fantastic and the colour scheme is brilliant. hitchcock was a great director when it comes to those aspects. but aside from that he was an overrated mysoginist. and that's coming from me. classic
It was okay. Good twist, full movie, but nothing that special
Quite unlike any film I've seen before. Hitchcock's classic may be the perfect summation of his own neuroses and obsessions, it is also a near-perfect synthesis of image, sound and story. Mountains of print already written about it, to which I can't add anything of originality, but speak for how dense the film is with interpretations and analyses. It is also hugely entertaining, pulling me slowly into its spirally descending narrative. Love the way he took Stewart (the all-American Tom Hanks of his day) and made him this seriously screwed up pervert. I can imagine Hitch watching the final version of his film with a youthful grin on his face.
I've learned to love this movie, but I swear to God if I have to watch the motel scene one more time I will cut my foot off and use it to smash my computer to bits.
Enjoyed the movie ,, HATED THE ENDING,, I’m not good at writing these things so look at others if you want an intense review on this bc...whew...this was a hella movie
Didn't think this was great to be honest
Pretty unimpressed really, misogyny masquerading as psychological truth, great performances, well scored, bit boring, bit tiny.
Men truly ain’t shit
the movie was good... until the last part
I hadn't seen this before cause I'm an uncultured swine. Fun facts: - if you take away all the shots of perplexed Jimmy Stewart driving a car, Vertigo can be viewed as a Vine - Midge painting Carlotta is such a hilarious way to really fuck someone up - This movie is completely horrifying. I knew it was one of Hitchcock's most disturbing but Jesus this ruined my weekend. Perfect
“You shouldn’t have been... You shouldn’t have been that sentimental.” Only thing deadlier than heights is love. BA-DUM TSSS
probably one of my favorite Hitchcock films. you'll wanna visit Frisco after watching.
The 2018 Cult Movie Challenge Film Noir Week Vertigo is a strange noir, investigatives parts are simple and the mystery is solved in the middle of the film, then, it become more psychological, it reminds me of "Les diaboliques", that is 3 years older. From a technical aspect, Vertigo is perfect, it even gives a name to a particular camera effect. James Stewart made a great performance while i didn't like the performance of Kim Novak, i found her too much emotionless.
The Star Room Cinema Oh man, this was incredible. The first act is so slow, and meticulous but goddamn Act 2 is incredible. I've heard about the mysogynistic, and male gaze elements before hand and for 3/4 of the film I was like damn where is this stuff, Scottie seems like a nice fella, aside from sorta being obsessed with Madeleine, and then IT started to happen. Jesus, The 50's were so wild fuck lmaooo. It's incredible on a technical level, it's truly a flawed masterpiece. The dream sequences, and the neon scene are properly gorgeous. That ending is properly booty, like i've said before films used to kinda just end.
i guess i fall into the category of people not loving the ending. i would’ve rated it higher if it hadn’t been for the emotional abuse at the end that’s just not sitting well with me. the rest was SO good though
i liked it a lot to say the least,, very entertaining n funny at times I really loved the animation sequence
The fact that this pulp crime novel adaptation about history, obsession, mystery and ghosts on the streets of San Francisco can be almost universally considered one of the best movies ever made just goes to show that sometimes the world is good. My ideal noir.
Still hilarious
100/ 100 I think this may be the greatest film of all time. Vertigo is a lush beauty. It's a dark Hitchcock thriller that is filled with color and so much meticulous detail that it set a new landmark. It sees Hitchcock at his best and film at its best as it is filled with symbolism, a twisty story, and a psychoanalysis of a director who finally let's us dive deep inside his mind.
I'm going to steal so much from this film.
midge: johnny johnny john: yes papa midge: having acrophobia? john: no papa midge: telling lies? john: no papa midge: climb up the ladder john: hahaha
this film is hilarious but also im obsessed with dolly zooms so i appreciated it
Heartbreaking. Perfection exists.
Hitchcock directed a masterpiece that will prevail in film history as one of the best.
During the second half of the film my inner feminist couldn't stop screaming and that's the only reason I'm taking one star away.
You shouldn’t have been that sentimental
I'm not sure whether I liked this movie or not. Obviously, it's a legendary film, and the story held my interest, the writing had me invested in the characters. However, in 2018, Vertigo is starting to show its age in some not-so-nice ways. First of all, the treatment of mental illness in this movie is questionable. The trauma experienced by Scottie in the opening scenes and the titular vertigo that ails him as a result causes him to be characterized as a coward and a weakling, someone who wasn't able to "man up." Second, this movie has the classic Old Hollywood "teenage girl dates a skeleton" trope (ok I'm exaggerating but Madeleine is in her mid 20s and Scottie is like, 45). That alone would be more tolerable to me if some effort had been put into developing a feasible relationship between the two of them that is based on something besides just Madeleine's good looks. It wasn't all bad though, I really enjoyed the more psychedelic parts of the film, such as Scottie's fever dream sequence, as well as the mystery of Madeleine's madness. This movie is a legend for a reason, after all.
I feel after a few more viewings (even though it's over 60 years old), Vertigo will find itself in my top 5 of all time. I already felt its dizzying power from the opening credits and kept me in a state of bewilderment till the very end. Iconic camera work (the "vertigo effect"/dolly zoom anyone?), hypnotizing art direction, use of colour (green will never used quite like this again!), memorable performances and Bernard Hermann’s twisty score... it has stood the test of time. Its influence can be felt in every psychological thriller since its release. There is no denying this as essential cinema.
Gosh, I love certain things about this movie. The metaphor that vertigo/acrophobia becomes for Scottie's psyche. The use of color (so much green!). The story itself, from Scottie unfortunately being always just out of reach and unable to save those that need saving to his manipulation and being manipulated. But there are a handful of things that keep me at arms length. The movie is so deliberately paced that it feels like it lags a bit for me. While I love Jimmy Stewart in lots of movies, it feels like he's overacting here; there are some scenes where I just see Stewart doing his thing instead of Scottie. Tied to that, the melodrama at times takes me out of the movie. Often I love the music, but sometimes it is too much. I want to give this 5-stars, but I just can't. But I will keep rewatching it and showing it to my Film Studies class because there's too much going on not to.
This feels like my millionth time im seeing this (I TA first year film study and saw it three times in the past year alone) I think this sums up my latest watch best - to quote someone I respect “Hitchcock might have been an asshole but he was no idiot”
Noirvember 2018 Wow! Wow wow wow! Wow wow wow wow wow wow wow! I can’t believe I put off seeing this masterpiece for this long. What is there to say that hasn’t already been said? If you haven’t seen this film then go yourself a favor and check it out. Easily up there in the greatest of all time. Great cinematography, great directing, great writing, great acting. Superb plot twist I did not see coming. Nail biting suspense, gut churning horror, edge of your seat engagement. This film is one of those movies that utilizes everything that is possible in the medium of film to its full advantage. Every single thing in the production plays into the ideas of the film. Every possible choice on how to make scenes as creative as possible were utilized. This was truly inspiring and it was a marvel to finally watch it after so long. Anyway, don’t read my review, just watch the movie, it will be certainly more interesting than reading me blab on for two hours about things already touched upon in better criticisms of the film.
“Anyone can become obsessed with the past.” The Grand Illusion
Love Jimmy Stewart
Wild time But I loved it
all i can say is that i’m speechless. THANK YOU HITCHCOCK
A technically well made movie, Hitchcock clearly loves Technicolor. The story however, makes me wanna gouge my eyeballs out in sheer frustration.
😱😱😱😱 out of 😱😱😱😱😱 Technicolor on the 2012 BD is insane
Hitchcock proves once again that he is a master of his craft in this sublime thriller that constantly keeps you guessing while also featuring a handful of excellent performances and a hypnotic atmosphere boosted by skillful cinematography and a memorable score.
Better on the third rewatch
Finally on board, even if Vertigo remains firmly behind Psycho and Rear Window—and neck-and-neck with Strangers on a Train—on my Hitchcock master list. Hadn't seen this in over a decade, but I'd watched it about three times in a relatively short span in the mid-2000's, desperately trying to generate the same level of unabashed enthusiasm that seemingly everybody else in the film community felt; well, I'm still not quite there, but this time around, I was able to bask in the gloriously haunting compositions and mysterious psychological probing with far fewer reservations than before. Also caught some things I didn't remember at all—was pretty cool, for instance, to note that Vertigo opens in basically an identical manner to Rear Window, with a restless Stewart desperately trying to overcome a physical ailment in order to scratch a literal itch. Similarly, his complicated relationships with women of all forms—simultaneously aroused and intimidated by their strength; both Midge and Madeleine, in their own ways, blend feminine wile with an independent streak that challenges stereotype, much like Lisa in Rear Window—feels like a continuation of a trend that I didn't recall as acutely as I should have. And the way Stewart evolves from reluctant participant in the 'case' to wholly invested piece of a the puzzle...well, that goes way beyond just Hitchcock, though it's certainly most prevalent in his work. Still find the story itself to be ever-so-slightly inferior to my aforementioned favorites, especially w/r/t the switcheroo and its connotation/the conclusion, but it's still gripping as can be. Terrific performances all around, and as noted before...formally, just ravishing. Happy to have joined the fan club, and will be more than delighted to check back in over the years to continue the evolution of my personal feelings for this acclaimed behemoth, which I finally appreciate as worthy of the adoration. PRO (Also, I wish there was more Midge. She's just tremendously layered and rich, despite significantly less screen time than the other protagonists...)
Beautiful 70mm print for Hitchcocktober 2017, Sarah's first time watching
snapped!
Out of words. To quote Robert Bresson, I’d rather feel a movie than understand it. This is the epitome of that, perfectly dreamy, mysterious, cathartic. The score is one of the best ever, and this is definitely Hitchcock’s masterpiece when it comes to what film is most revolutionary in cinematic storytelling. Both Psycho and Rear window could take the top spot, but Vertigo does it for me.
I don't like going to church either
Can't decide if it is 4 or 4.5 yet. I started to lose interest after Madlen's "death", but after Scottie finds Judy it picks up and that third act is very strong.
Haha I love this film so fucking much
Missed the last 20 minutes (Film Class) but I enjoyed this throughout. Good characters and a MAGNIFICENT SCORE!
It’s been three years since I saw Vertigo so felt it was due a rewatch. It’s never been my favourite Hitchcock and this viewing didn’t change my opinion but I still like it. Thematically Vertigo is an interesting feature as screenwriters Alec Coppel and Samuel Taylor wonderfully explore the idea of possession and its impact on the characters contained within the plot. Scottie in particular becomes possessed by his past failings and his current fears and obsesses himself with the need to rid himself of them. In the second half of the film his possession of Madeleine to the point where he seeks to almost bring her back from the dead is deeply uncomfortable to watch and the writers deserve credit for managing to place such elements into a mainstream film.  However, because the writers are so interested in their main characters and the relationships between them the plot becomes almost secondary and the structure of the film is deeply repetitive to a point where it becomes a little dull in places. Scottie seems to follow Madeleine for what feels like an awfully long period of time, the deaths are all the same and Madeleine’s husband turns up at key moments to reinforce the fragile state of her mental health. So although fascinating the complex, emotional relationship between the two leads overwhelm every other aspect of the story and makes it feel a little poorly executed in terms of storytelling. From an acting stand-point Kim Novak is astonishingly good as Madeleine. Her cool acting style allows her to perfectly portray the complexity of Madeleine and right up until the end we are never entirely certain of her morality, motivations or overall intentions meaning the character remains an enigma right up until the end. However, I don’t feel that James Stewart is right for this part at all. Although undoubtedly one of the greatest screen actors of all time, here he feels out of his depth. Hitchcock apparently was concerned he was too old for the part and I think he could have been right. Him and Novak don’t have a natural chemistry in this film and Stewart doesn’t have the suaveness or darkness necessary to play such a damaged or indeed ultimately deranged character as Scottie.  Alfred Hitchcock however, ensures that Vertigo redeems itself hugely as it is an amazing directorial achievement. The use of colour in the film truly is remarkable, each set is beautifully designed with every scene featuring the recurrence of the colours Green and Red which create a beautiful visual style for the film. Some of the visual effects work such as the dream sequence is truly incredible and some of the camera technique in the film (particularly when used to visually highlight Stewart’s Vertigo) is incredibly innovative. What also is remarkable is Hitchcock’s use of the landmarks of San Francisco. Vertigo features some of the greatest location filming seen in cinema history and much of it is so good that San Francisco becomes almost a character in the film. Incredible. Special mention must also be given to Bernard Herman’s driving, brooding score which adds a great deal of suspense to proceedings. Overall Vertigo is flawed but good. The themes and ideas explored in it are bold but at times overwhelm the narrative a little and the emotionally complex nature of the main role doesn’t seem to fit with James Stewart’s acting style. However, Vertigo is saved by the excellent Kim Novak, a brilliant second half which takes the film in a startling dramatic direction and some of the best and most stylish direction seen in mainstream cinema that really is the work of a master.
My favourite film of all time. A treat to see it on the big screen again.
Catfishing for the pre-internet generation  James Stuart’s Scotty character is clearly a lame choice to keep an eye on your Mrs.  Not only is he limited to low-rise activities, before long he’s snogging her!  Not very professional. I have to confess, I struggle to see what’s so wonderful about Hitchcock’s films today. I appreciate how groundbreaking he was but this was overly long and underly clear. If Judy couldn’t see how her night was going to end the moment he pulled up at the nunnery, then she deserved to fall, screaming to her doom.
Totnes Cinema. Still my favourite film.
Beautifully shot, interesting plot, ending was clever and unexpected. First half of the film was a bit boring. Cautionary tale of the dangers of dishonesty.
First watch - what the hell! who is Madeline, or Judy, or ... who am I watching ? This plot twist has confused me and I feel like my brain twisted with it and I can’t comprehend anything. I need to watch it again.  Second watch - *distinguishes difference between Madeline and judy* ... this is beginning to make sense and the plot is fascinatingly frustrating, I need to watch it again to try and notice the clues that help unwind the plot. Third watch - Discovers the entire plot can be explained by one the earliest sequences in the entire movie (Earnie’s restaurant). I must continue watching this films as it provides so many interpretations and ideological aspects throughout the film.  Countless watches later - I love the complexity of this film, also, I should probably write a review about it on Letterboxd ... So... This movie I have now seen so many times I can no longer count it on my fingers, every time I watch it something new grasps my attention and I view it from a different perspective. Hitchcock “the master of suspense” portrays all his Fraudian influenced symbolic objects such as the ship placed in the cabinet during Ernest’s setting early on in the film, representing women and femininity. As Ernest works as a ship constructer his entire profession is symbolised for how he constructs women, foreshadowing to how he’s constructed Madeline / Judy. This is one of many symbolic objects Hitchcock uses to help unfold the thick plot.  The sequence which delivers the entire plot in the space of one minute occurs directly after the sequence previously mentioned in earnest’s space. Earnie’s restaurant is the first location where Madeline / Judy is presented, the sequence contains no dialogue just a non-diegetic score of warm string instruments playing jazz emphasising the love between the Earnest and Madeline / Judy but also the love scotty develops towards her throughout the film. When introduced she is the only character wearing colour, green, representing fertility, misfortune and envy, all of which prove true in the plot that follows. She becomes a binary contrast to the background which is red whilst she is the dominant contrast. Despite this she is very much sexualised as she has much bare skin showing and it is an indication of how she is just an object to fill the place of someone more important, but also how people see her and indirectly state how they wish to commit sexual acts with her. Later on in the sequence the spectators see the side profile close up shot of Madeline / Judy, which is half is casted in shadow through chiaroscuro and there’s a red flush of lighting covering her jawline and hairline of her versage. We only see 50% of her as she is ultimately hiding her identity, the 50% of her which is Judy. The final and most vital element to the sequence is as Madeline and earnest leave the restaurant and walk out with a mirror clearly portraying themselves this produces two exact replicas of the characters showing how they have double lives, dual personalities, dual characters, leaving scotty wonder about the actions he has seen.   Later on in the film we see Madeline / Judy’s reflection in the water, the replica of the painting and her mocking the actions indentically, alongside an endless list of symbolic actions, gestures and props which until you rewatch the film you would never notice even if you looked for it.   Hitchcock once again portrayed a physchologically confused male protagonist and extrapolates on his phobias by using his stronger feelings of love and lust. Presents a aesthetically pleasing picture of the lead female and she is 3x framed in a shot (inner doorway, doorway, and cinematic frame) thus, showing her worth alongside beauty.
it was so nice of hitchcock to pay homage to The Princess Diaries (2001) by having the setting for this film be san francisco
Pretty damn good. Personally, Golden Age Hollywood films just have a visual formula that I find really distracting, also making the pacing feel a lot slower than it really is.
tbh wig my eyes got watery while watching it, i was so speechless i keep thinking about it fuck the ending tho
I don't think Vertigo will ever be one of my favourite Hitchcocks. I don't seem to be able to get wrapped up in it, in the way I can with Psycho, Rebecca or Rear Window. But, despite that, it's still magnificent: twisted, innovative and scary.
Extremely riveting! It's weird seeing and hearing people talk about landmarks that are so close to me. The movie is beautiful, exciting, and I loved all the twists. I love Hitchcock's portrayal of obsession and love. Honestly, I didn't know anything about the story and I was genuinely surprised by how much I enjoyed it. I totally understand why this is one of his most praised films.
That storyline plot twist though ... absolutely excellent. Locals in 1958 must have been shook the absolute core watching the movie unfold. Such a graceful yet suspenseful film. The Goat. Been wanting to watch this for such a long time now and it didn’t disappoint at all. Ugh, whew.
Of course, you can't expect good old Hitch to portray women realistically, but I like how this film exposes the lethal obsession behind love of seemingly perfect men.
Me watching the wacky ass Spirograph intro: :D Me watching James Stewart driving for a really long time: >:O Me when the wacky spirals come back and James Stewart’s disembodied head comes flying out at me: :D Me realizing the rest of the film is gonna be creepy clothes-buying and stressful sorta kinda murder plots: >:O
In this hitchcock classic we follow a former police detective john ferguson who gets asked by a friend to follow his wife madeleine because she is behaving weirdly all of a sudden. John does this and during his work he starts to get interested in this woman himself. I don't really wanna say a whole lot more about the plot but it definitely manages to keep you guessing, themes include obsession, female oppression but also love and trauma. It's very well shot, with some breathtaking outdoor sceneries, the acting of our main cast is top notch (outside of the somewhat "oldschool" style ofc) and the writing is overall pretty good as well. I have some small issues with the pacing and the ending in particular, i didn't love the film but it's definitelly still a recommendation for anyone.
Here I was born, and there I died. It was only a moment for you — you took no notice. Vertigo is mostly known as Hitchcock’s masterpiece and whilst some will disagree, it still has so much to offer to the modern viewer. Brilliantly executed, it shows the director’s uncanny ability to tell both thrilling and ageless stories. The feature is original in every aspect. Novak shines as the lead woman and Stewart is a great antagonist. Everyone has different interpretations about this classic and I have to say mine changed drastically since my first viewing. Definitely a feature that asks to and needs to be revisited from time to time.
women be driving - alfred hitchcock
A fantastic escapade showcasing the origins of much of the film technique we see today. From complicated characters to flagrant use of color themes, it is a feast for the feels and the senses. Kim Novak is delicious and Jimmy Stewart brings the crazy in his way. It is also yet another example of the meticulous attention to detail that Hitchcock applies to all of his films. In every frame you can see the neurosis that makes him great. And of course, (spoiler alert) there's a murder.....
Perhaps a little more convoluted and meandering than I had hoped for, but the loose narrative is almost certainly written in intentional parallel to the "wandering" characters. Great performances by Stewart and Novak but Barbara Bel Geddes deserves special attention for her turn (and I wish Midge had gotten a bit more closure). Stylish, mysterious, and shocking. Hitchcock at his (almost) best. P.S. Hitchcock was right to want to remove the letter writing scene.
Dreamlike and vivid in it's imagery, Vertigo is a unique look into the consuming nature of obsession. The story may feel uneven and sometimes plodding, but being on the cusp of greatness is what makes the film so engaging. The story seems very personal to Hitchcock and despite it's faults, that dedication to the craft and the central ideas makes Vertigo so exceptional.
Hitchcock outdone himself with a brilliant innovation and idea for film. I love the message portrayed in this film which comments on the male and female relationship and roles. At first the ending seem kind of forced and random, but after thinking about it for a while, it ties together with the theme and I appreciate it a lot more than I originally had. Unlike films today, the acting was very overdramatic which I can understand in some scenes, for instance, when Judy is trying to play as Madeline, but in others it was just over the top for me. I feel like this is one of those films where when you watch it again you discover things you didn't notice the first time you were watching it. Adding on, I definitely have to watch this film again and appreciate Hitchcock's work even more. The soundtrack was a plus too.
i enjoyed this a lot more than i thought i would! it was energetic, engaging, and wow does that vertigo hit! i think i wanna go outside and try dolly zooming now.. brb
Hooptober 5 -- Postmortem Ashes Scattered Edition So...okay. Elephant in the room...I'm aware it's not October anymore. And look, maybe I didn't watch every single little tiny frame of film I was supposed to watch in the allotted time frame, no. But basically I made a list of films I wanted to see, and I'm gonna watch 'em by hook or by crook. Yeah. So that's this.  In Memoriam: Vertigo 1958 - 2018  Obituary: I'm the first one to admit that I'm severely lacking when it comes to "essential" films that buzzfeed lists, Roger Ebert, TCM's Saturday night lineup and countless other sources tell me that I should be watching instead of bizarre thriftstore VHS tapes or 2002's Rollerball for the 50th time.  It's true. You can pretty much name any certified classic film that comes to mind and the fact is that I haven't have seen it. That's not truly intentional on my part. I have nothing inherently against films with a pedigree or a great reputation. I just seem to de-prioritize them entirely too often in lieu of picking up things that are more extremely polarizing.  Or that I have absolutely no knowledge of at all. Because I definitely do get a giddy little thrill discovering a hidden gem like that on my own instead of picking up a film that I think will be good and then just....enjoying it the exact same amount I assumed I would. Part of me also kind of enjoys not being inspired by great things as well. So that if and when I ever do come up with a joke, a story, a thought, or an idea that other people think is especially clever and it happens to resemble something that was already minted and coined as "great" decades ago by a talented auteur that I was unaware of, it reminds me that I inadvertently shared some inspiration when a truly great mind all on my own.  Don't laugh! It could still happen one day! I got a good, original knock knock joke in me yet before I'm gone! So more often than not, while I roll the dice on inauspicious fluff like Russell Madness, Josh and S.a.m. or 3 Ninjas High Noon at Mega Mountain, certified wolves in wolves clothing elites like Citizen Kane, Modern Times, Grand Illusion, The Godfather, Schindler's List and Sunset Boulevard collect more dust on my shelf. But not today!  Today I indulged in a film that more than elventy billion finely educated folks with delicately, well kempt and manicured fingernails agree is stunning, thought provoking, mind-bending, clever, exceptionally well made, and also good. It's Alfred Hitchcock's Vertigo. And yeah.  To paraphrase Joel Siegel: It's dope dawg.  Moderately dope AF. It's a beautifully crafted and noticeably meticulously made piece of work that is able to flesh out a two sentence pitch into a legitimately surprisingly and tense affair.  It's visuals and dream sequences are jarring and animated exceptionally well. And the color that pops off of this thing I think has only been rivaled by fellow neon nightmare Suspira in my eyes. I do have to rip on its presentation however.  For having successfully(?) avoided all things Vertigo for 34 years, putting in the VHS restoration version leads immediately to a PREVIEW FOR THE VERTIGO RESTORATION VERSION!  WHAT? WHY?! And then! Not only do I get to watch a solid 2 minutes of Vertigo sizzle reel. It's followed by THE ORIGINAL THEATRICAL TRAILER FOR VERTIGO AS WELL! GREAT! Now I get to see all the beats driven into my head TWICE in a row!  Thanks for shilling me a version of film THAT I'M LITERALLY ALREADY PLAYING Universal! You're the real monsters here. As for the rest of it...the cinematography.  The acting prowess. The blocking. The pitch shifting.  Yeah...I'm woefully unqualified to weigh in on any of those fronts.  Because I'm going to compare them to Rollerball's or a selection of Muppet Baby cartoons.  And that's going to definitely illicit all kinds of scoffing at and chortling and and throat phlegm rearrangement noises from upper crust cinematic hierarchy wearing monocles and looking through opera glasses on sticks.  It's not fair for me to knock a film down pegs for being intimidating or having a particular fanbase, but juggernauts like this whose fans know it backwards and forwards are in a word: intimidating. The thing I will tell you though is that this is very much a better directed movie than it is a story being told.  Hitchcock's eye is the star of the show here. Creating a dreamlike vibe and smokey ambiance throughout the proceedings while purposely meandering through the first hour or so of the picture are its strengths.  While it's weaknesses lie in character depth, backstory and motivation. Want proof? Explain the plot to a middle school kid who's never heard of it TOMORROW and watch them make that ugly, disgusted scrunchface that only shitbird kids that age can make.  Then swat the books out of their hands and call 'em a FUCKIN NERD and RUN! Overall, am I sorry I watched this?  Of course not. It was and remains an example of an extremely skilled person doing what they do best.  But it also kind of validates my earlier point. I enjoyed this about exactly as much as I assumed i would.  No seismic blips on the radar scale pro or con. So does that make watching it irrelevant? Should I have been more aggressive by stepping up and taking a gorilla hack at something like Chopper Chicks in Zombietown and hoping for the best?  At first thought maybe. But marinating on it, not always. Because these days I'm watching films made by people who have already all grown up inspired by the greats already. So I've unknowingly leeched off of selected greatness here and there just by proxy and through osmosis.  And even if something has a storied reputation, I'm comfortable enough in the taste palette I've carved out for myself to be able to recognize what I'd consider good, bad or ugly. And confident enough to not be swayed just because "SHAUN EDWARDS OF FOX TV SAYS THIS IS THE COOOOLEST MOVIE OF THE SUMMER!"  To me, the only thing reputation does to a film is increase its longevity. And Vertigo's lineage managed to get it preserved by greater minds than mine and give me the chance to view it for myself. Glad I had the chance. Okay. Back to Rollerball. RIP (Phantom) Plot #25. Screened out of competition. In lieu of flowers, please pay your respects here. Complaints and grievances about the care/smell of your loved ones may be directed to your caretaker.
Not his worst movie, but probably his worst treatment of women.   It’s a product of the time, I get it, but even with that in mind this is still pretty hard to swallow. The first half is great, a private eye on a paranormal hunt for the truth trying to overcome the psychological scarring of a horrible event? Fuck yeah! The last half, a woman being forced to change herself entirely for a man who has become crazed and controlling, I can give that a pass.  On a technical level Hitchcock knocks it out the park. His long slow shots, dynamic use of lighting, everything that makes him the master of suspense is here in force. James Stewart lends himself to another great performance, as does Kim Novak. The story is well structured and intriguing. But that last act.
No matter how simple this plot is, it keeps you stucked on the entire story. "Vertigo" is about traumas and how day life is influenced by what frighten us. When our fears take power even other people could be involved. They suffer and find themselves in bad situations. Events are matched by a variety of colors to convey different emotions. Hitchcock had a lot of fun using them. This is a must-see movie.
The pacing and cinematography are great and the story is even better. Just edged out North by Northwest for my favorite Hitchcock film.
this is about as good as the rocky horror picture show, according to my recent letterboxd activity. you’re welcome, everyone!
Uhm.. what? Why do people love this movie so much? Is it the story that's completely laid out in front of the viewer halfway through the film? The main character that starts out unstable and obsessive and ends up unstable and obsessive? The romance blooming between two characters who share five minutes of screentime and whose interactions turn out to be largely dishonest? The ridiculous ending that renders the entire movie pointless? Sure, it's well-shot, but so it Notorious. Watch Notorious instead.
James Stewart and Kim Novak star in Alfred Hitchcock’s psychological thriller about attraction, duplicity, domination and desperation. Also starring Tom Helmore and Barbara Bel Geddes. When Vertigo was released, it received a mixed critical reception, but is now regarded as a classic of Alfred Hitchcock’s filmography. However, I disagree with the latter part of this, because this is not a perfect film from the Master of Suspense. The story concerns an ex-police officer who, suffering from an intense fear of heights, is employed to stop an old pal’s wife from killing herself, but all isn’t what it appears to be. James Stewart gives a very good performance in his role as John ‘Scottie’ Ferguson, the former cop who has to try and stop a woman from committing suicide, but he finds it harder than what he thought it was going to be like. He suits his role well. Kim Novak is decent in her double role as Madeleine Elster and Judy Barton. Madeleine is the woman who is behaving in a very strange way, while Judy is the woman who Madeleine reveals herself to be. This is perhaps the most memorable role of her career. Elsewhere, there are respectable supporting performances to be had from Tom Helmore and Barbara Del Geddes in their respective roles as Gavin Elster and Midge Wood. Gavin is Madeleine’s husband who is concerned by his wife’s conduct, while Midge is the woman who used to be engaged to Scottie. The direction from Hitchcock is very good because he allows the facial expressions to be seen to a strong effect throughout, while also keeping a tense atmosphere happening as well and the script is written to a decent standard by Alec Coppel, Samuel A. Taylor and Maxwell Anderson as they make the movie good to follow. The technical aspects that stand out best are the set, camera and music, because the set is terrific to view throughout; the camera makes very good use of the locations and also captures the tense moments well, which get the edge-of-the-seat status; the music is very enjoyable to listen to. The movie managed to win 2 Academy Award nominations: Best Production Design (Black-and-White or Colour) and Best Sound. However, this isn’t perfect, because the pace of the film can be very slow at times and a result, the movie didn’t need to run for 129 minutes. Also, although there is a tense atmosphere happening, there isn’t as much occurring as there is compared to other Hitchcock films. This is a real shame. Overall, the performances from James Stewart and Kim Novak, direction, script and technical aspects are very good, but Vertigo is not a masterpiece, due to the sometimes-very slow pace and lack of tension on occasions.
the male gaze is a hell of a drug
This was a really nice film but I have to admit I found it very confusing and really very hard to follow. In the end I understood vaguely what was going on but the final scene felt so rushed still and it left me very un-at peace. On top of this, it was way too long and I found myself severely bored several times. I'm a sucker for old films though I can't lie.
been doin a lot of 5-stars lately, not sure if it’s because my standards are changing or i’m just watching good movies 🤔
Ya know what, no one’s really gonna read this bc of the length so I’m gonna say everything that’s on my mind, let’s just jump into it. Vertigo is utterly amazing. The cinematography is top notch (and man oh man does it look great on blu ray), the leads are strong, and it manages to balance its plot to turn what could’ve been a convoluted mess into a heart pounding and emotional thriller. Hitchcock is (obviously) a genius in his craft, and his direction especially shines here. Stewart and Novak turn out wonderfully complex performances that really pay off in the final act. Speaking of that third act, a lot of people on here aren’t a fan. Personally? Loved it. It did have a multiple ending problem, but the final one really sticks the landing. I probably teared up while watching it (really don’t remember) but I did feel really confused and just out of it afterwards (thanks Alfred?). This is probably one of the longest things I’ve written on here and I’m running out of things to say and I honestly pulled like half of this out of my ass to sound smart and my thumbs are starting to hurt so I’m gonna leave it at that, BUT I just wanted you to know that this is one of those movies I could ramble on for a while about.  Also this is some good shit right here, I’d recommend if you liked this movie (or you didn’t and you’re just a film nerd)
I have been watching Hitchcock films lately and this is my favorite so far. The plot is great and it is handled masterfully. I loved the range of tones in the film -- from eerie haunted house to thriller. The visuals were beautiful. Kim Novak was an extremely talented actress. Great film! My only complaint is that the pacing was slow at times.
Arguably Hitchcock’s best and one of Stewart’s best performances. He really is quite disturbingly crazed and is both manipulated and manipulative as he discovers the truth. The visuals and colour palette are gorgeous and that score by Herrmann is nothing short of astonishing.
A classic Hitckock, not that boring actually, and impressive. I have found it a bit too long to be truthful, but also entertaining. Of course I have loved to pieces the green curtains scene.
I genuinely find I like this film less each time I watch it. The first act is really clunky, the editing is all over the place (for me), and that ending is just so...underwhelming. It's deliberately paced and plotted, but that deliberation just isn't my cup of tea. Highlight of this watch: My GF, seeing it for the first time, saying "If this doesn't end with a confrontation on the Golden Gate bridge, I'll be bummed.
It was good but can y’all calm down
It feels unnecessary to repeat how incredible a director Stanley Kubrick was and how genuinely impeccable his films turned out to be, and 'A Clockwork Orange' reaffirms this notion. While this is definitely one of his darker films, with plenty of 'ultra-violence' and sex throughout the entirety of the film, it nevertheless lives up to the perfect standard of filmmaking that Kubrick has gained a reputation for. Set in a near dystopian future where violent criminals run amok throughout the streets, the film follows central anti-hero Alex, the leader of a group of droogs, as he goes about causing mayhem within the city, until he is captured after accidentally killing a woman and sentenced to 14 years of prison life. He soon discovers however that there is one way to shorten this sentence and that is by submitting himself to a horrific experimental cure that intends to psychologically reconfigure him. It is a dark, disturbing film which offers an interesting perspective on morality - when Alex suffers as a result of his past crimes, it makes the viewer contemplate whether this is justice for his actions. Kubrick's artistic style shines brightly in this film, with heavy uses of different camera angles (low angle shots are often used in this film to portray a contorted view of reality and has frightening, visceral affects), unique editing, etc. In addition to this, Kubrick utilises a plethora of classical music to accompany the film, reflecting Alex's love for the genre, but simultaneously its adds to the dramatic tension and suspense within the film, and often punctuates the action within a scene. 'A Clockwork Orange' continues the trend of superb Kubrick movies in every way. It is another indisputable masterpiece by the director, and has a brilliant lead performance by Malcolm McDowell (although, outside of his performance, all other actors seem to be overshadowed by him).
so end doesn’t justify the means and machiavelli was wrong
I would be completely okay if society decided to forget this film. Why Kubrick felt the need to make his Free Will film about a deeply viscous person rather than a virtuous person is curious, but not baffling. But why he chose to make vice look so much *fun* is truly beyond me. There is a long list of copycat crimes linked to this film, and not just from the year of its release. Why, when something is causing such clear harm in our world, do we still insist on honoring it? Films like A Man for All Seasons, about a virtuous person refusing to bend to the will of evil authorities should be held up as examples instead. Some may argue that the artistic value of the film should be appreciated, but that is exactly why it is so dangerous. You can find films even more repulsive than this when it comes to acts of sexual violence, but none of them have had Kubrick behind the camera directing it to perfection.
Beautiful film. But what did Stanley Kubrick have against women with larger-than-a-dime areolas/nipples? In all his films they have tiny, tiny nipples. I know he’s got an eye for detail and symmetry but damn.  (I have normal sized nipples I promise)
I think the general idea here — as to whether or not this sort of ‘rehabilitation’ of a criminal is just — is inherently fascinating, but I genuinely don’t think it came across here. It’s well acted to be sure, and you can see the kinds of stylistic flourishes and striking cinematography Kubrick became known for, but the plight of the protagonist was really not that interesting. The pacing is stilted, too, and that really grinds the protagonists journey to an almost standstill. I understand what people see in this movie, and I don’t regret having watched it, but I don’t see it myself.
========================================== Part of My Autumn Rewatches 2.0 Challenge ========================================== Task #6: Rewatch a film by one of your favorite directors. For this task, I decided to revisit my second favorite film by Stanley Kubrick, having already rewatched "2001: A Space Odyssey" (1968) for a different task. I first saw this film in the theater after reading the Anthony Burgess novel upon which it was based, a book I dearly loved and which made me think quite differently about language and its evolution. The film version blew me away, because it not only brought the book to the screen, but also added dimensions either I missed or were invented to extend the story beyond the pages. In any event, the film holds a place on my 50 Favorites list, and it is high time I gave it another viewing. Things I never forgot:  The Korova Milk Bar. Alex (Malcolm McDowell), narrating, and his three droogs: Pete (Michael Tarn), Georgie (James Marcus) and Dim (Warren Clarke). The tables looking like naked women. The milk laced with various drugs. "A bit of the old ultra-violence," taking the piss out of an old drunk. Billyboy (Richard Connaught) and his four droogs about to rape a girl (Cheryl Grunwald). The gang fight. Police sirens. Escape to the country. The ultra-violent home invasion. "Singing in the Rain." The rape of Mrs. Alexander (Adrienne Corri) and crippling of her husband Frank (Patrick Magee). Alex's love of "the old Ludwig Van." Alex skipping school. The penis-shaped ice pops licked by the girls at the mall. The high-speed threesome back at Alex's room. Georgie's plan for a "big crast," robbing Miss Weathers (Miriam Karlin), the wealthy owner of Woodmere Health Farm. Alex teaching Georgie and Dim who the leader is. The attempted robbery and attack on Weathers. The droogies teaching Alex who the boss is. Alex in custody. Weathers dies. Deltoid unable to help. Alex sentenced to 14 years for murder. Prison enrollment. The preaching of the prison chaplain (Godfrey Quigley). Alex volunteering for the "special treatment" -- the Ludovico Technique -- to get released early. The film's core message: "When a man cannot choose, he ceases to be a man." Alex's acceptance into the treatment by government Minister Frederick (Anthony Sharp)(). The explicit videos with music. The sickness. The "proof" of Alex's reformation. Joe (Clive Francis) the lodger renting Alex's room forcing Alex off on his own. Alex attacked by the homeless. Dim and Georgie as policemen. Their beating him. His coming to the home they invaded. Wheelchair-bound Frank and his body guard Julien (David Prowse) trying to help, before realizing who he is. Torturing Alex with Beethoven's 9th. Attempted suicide. Alex in hospital. Headline news. Apology from Minister Frederick. Alex back to "normal."  Things I had forgotten:  Beethoven's 9th sung in the milk bar. Yarbles! The defaced mural in the lobby of Alex's apartment building. His pet snake Basil. His factory-working mum (Sheila Raynor) and weak-willed father (Philip Stone). The home visit from Mr. Deltoid (Aubrey Morris). WOW! = The videodisc for "2001" front and center at the audio/video shop in the mall. Alex's very personal interpretation of the Bible.  There has been no degradation of this film in almost half a century. It's still as powerful today as it ever was. And McDowell totally owned this role, for which he received a Golden Globe nomination for Best Actor in a Motion Picture - Drama. At the Academy Awards, four nominations were received: Best Film Editing (Bill Butler) and well as three Oscar mentions for Kubrick -- Best Picture, Director and Adapted Screenplay. It is and will ever be a masterpiece of 20th century cinema.

This movie made me uncomfy. Stanley Kubrick’s other vision of the future paints a society tearing at the seams, giving the vibe of what the sixties thought the nineties would be like. This slightly off setting of the story really makes you suspend disbelief and just look at what the director is presenting you. And it’s pretty fucking weird. This is just my first viewing so I don’t really get it, but it seems to me that the theme is that no good comes from changing someone’s nature, or trying to. Throughout this movie I just felt sorry for people. I felt sorry for Alex’s victims and wanted him to get what was coming to him. And when he was released I just felt sorry for him, because I believe that he could have lived a well-adjusted life if he didn’t have to reap what he sowed before being admitted. Is the ending a happy one? Certainly for Alex, who is free to life, liberty, and the pursuit of ultra-violence, but the ending presents us with a moral question. If the treatment was the only thing holding him back from his tendencies, does he deserve to be treated as an upstanding member of society, or were the people who treated him badly justified in doing so? Idk man, it’s tough and makes you think. Whole lotta moral questions regarding Alex and the people who interact with him. 8/10
Amazing film. What I liked best is the script, it never lags, from start to finish
This movie was banned in the UK for about 30 years, and watching it now you wouldn't understand why. Back in 1971 I can understand it. The eye bit will always freak me out and the inny outy inny outy will always make me chuckle - yes I'm a bit of a child.
The last time I saw A Clockwork Orange was probably some time in the early 00s, and I remember at the time thinking it was an extraordinarily compelling film that wrestles with the idea of freedom and what to do with sociopaths in our society. On a second viewing, I still think that it's a great movie, but I have far more reservations about it than I did when I was younger. I think I better understand at this point the critiques about violence against women and the glamorization of it, and I do think the story is a bit too simple when grappling with a fairly noncomplex character in Alex. But the camera work is still sharp, and that opening scene still haunts me. I think having watched Singin' in the Rain only a couple of months ago I was very much struck this time around by how much of a juxtaposition it is to put that song in this movie. Overall, I have complicated feelings about this movie. But I do still think it's a masterpiece.
one of the worst movies i’ve ever seen. i’m all about freedom of creativity and stuff, but it was too far. i’m not blaming anyone for that, just the graphic violence and hate scenes were just not my cup of tea. in summary, the movie as a whole was not my cup of tea. don’t watch on a full stomach.
Stanley Kubrick’s A Clockwork Orange, the film uses symmetrical pleasing shots of a modern bizarre world in order to capture the dark sinister acts Alex and his gang pull. Messing up the symmetry we see regular pleasing shots but when the gang pulls an act we get uncomfortable closeups off center shots. During the film we see Alex lacking any empathy for anything, he only desires the thrill of being bad and careless. Ruining homes, violating, raping, and killing the cinematography captures his desire to go against society’s rules as much as possible
uhh this was ... so ... bad ?? i thought this would be incredible but it sorta feels like everyone just likes this & rates it high because it makes them look intellectual or artsy. like this films really not that deep, it's just a really big boring mess. the acting & accents were incredibly annoying that i had to turn it off with 15 minutes left
So I've always had some mixed feelings about this compared to most and I hate to piss people off again, but I'm not feeling this one in the end. On one hand, it's extremely stylish with some of most jaw-dropping erotic production design I've never seen before or even since. The story considering Kubrick's track record on films has a unique commentary that notably criticizes the decline of the standard family unit as the world would head into what would be a very tumultuous decade that spun the ideas of the 60's out of control. That all being said, a lot of its ideas didn't make sense to me (the boy's collection of body parts he has in room) and I honestly felt that its commentary failed to provide any truly realistic insight. Overall, I recognize the brilliance of it, and maybe I need to re-watch it again, but honestly it made me uncomfortable for 2 hours without making me feel like I got something out of it. If anything I would switch it to 4 stars, because I recognize some of the brilliance but I feel much of the extra hype lies more so in how daring it was for the time than its own merits as a film.
yes i watched this again and yes i enjoyed it please don't look at me during this trying time
A clockwork orangutan
"I was cured alright."
“I feel that any second, something terrible is going to happen to me.” - a cured Alex demonstrating a gift for predictions and summing up how I feel most days too.   As it happens, I’m watching this film only a few miles from where it was made.  The rumble between Alex & his Droogs and their rivals is reminiscent of classic ECW action - Spike Dudley or New Jack would have dived off the balcony after slamming their foe through the table.  Patrick Magee is excellent in his role as wheelchair bound avenging husband. His gleeful expression as he tortures Alex by stereo is fantastic.  The nursery school psychiatrist has an awesome tone when addressing Alex - coupled with her bitchin hair colour and dress sense would make exposing your innermost fears and feelings to her much easier. This was her only film role.
The title “A Clockwork Orange” makes me wonder if there’s another Clockwork Orange out there somewhere, because maybe that’s the super amazing great one. Cause this one was just that smirky, arrogant one that ran too long and wasn’t quite as clever as it seemed to think it was.
Had a hard time understanding what some of the actors were saying, not sure if it was the accents or the sound quality of my tv.  I need to watch again with subtitles.  Really enjoyed every other aspect but I don’t think I got as much out of it as I could’ve if I’d known exactly what the actors were saying
Can see why it's a classic it's a well-made film, I just wasn't feeling it, it's worldview or an attachment to the characters.
First Act: Wtf im watching? This guys a monster. Second Act: Atleast the monsters getting punished. Third Act: Damn everyones a monster Its hard to call this a masterpiece cause of how messed up it is but as long as you understand Kubrick was showing it knowing how messed up it all is I think everyone can call this a masterpiece. Again f'd up, and disturbing, but extremely well made and amazing. Which I guess is alot of Kubricks work
This chilling psychological story employs disturbing, violent scenes that explores juvenile delinquency and other such topics in a dystopian near future Britain. The protagonist, Alex, is a charismatic and reckless character who commits horrific crimes, such as rape and murder. One particular scene that captures the disturbing traits of the protagonist is where he and his gang rapes a woman and assaulted her husband as he is forced to watch the act. And although as a spectator I felt uncomfortable, that is reinforced with Alex giggling and singing “Singin’ in the Rain”. The film is a must see, but be ready to feel uncomfortable.
A mutual on twitter replied to one of my tweets but he had a clockwork orange pic on his profile so I didn’t engage. That’s sort of the vibe this film has.
of course men love this movie
Few films are as sensational or infamous as Stanley Kubrick's "A Clockwork Orange". It's impossible to sit through ACO and not have a reaction; whether it be shock, disgust or amazement. The savage tale of a brutal young droog and his subsequent "reformation" by the government is as shocking and thought-provoking as ever. While the film's depictions of violence and sex are what it's most known for, ACO works on far deeper levels. The disturbing portrayal of youth and its satirical depiction of a government's attempts to create a better society are brilliant, but the most fascinating aspect of ACO is the questions it poses about good and evil. While the crimes Alex commits at the beginning of the film are atrocious, what the government does to him is worse. The film presents the absolute worst aspects of man, but shows that even these are still favorable to a man without the choice. People can denounce the film because of its brutal content, but the importance of the questions it poses can't be denied. Equally excellent to the film's content is the effort by the crew. Kubrick's perfectionism pays off well, as ACO in one of his most visually striking films. Malcolm MacDowell is nothing short of amazing as Alex. Kubrick's use of surreal imagery and set pieces, as well as the ingenious use of music to compliment the on-screen action, creates a world that perfectly reflects the protagonist's behavior and the government's policies. A Clockwork Orange is by no means an easy film to get through, as many will be turned off by the scenes of violence and rape. But this masterpiece is far more complex than a simple romp through a world of youthful violence. It's a rare example of film-making that demands that the viewer actually think. Real horrorshow all around, Oh my brothers.
Whatever I once loved about this movie, I've since outgrown it.
Kubrick never fails when it comes to delivery some incredible imagery, sound design, and his overall direction. A Clockwork Orange may feel a little disjointed but ultimately its real horrorshow exploration of morality and violence grabs you whether you want it to or not.
Chilling look into human conditioning and how to treat and fix the crime problem thinking of the criminals mental state. I wouldn’t find it hard to believe if they tried this stuff today and the public would be okay with it Want to watch this one a lot more in the future
As I watched 'A Clockwork Orange' for the first time in several years, I gritted my teeth at the despicable lead character of "ultraviolient" Alex - a murderer, rapist, and psychopath. I thought to myself that this film should be worth 5 stars, if only the respective protagonist weren't such a foul excuse of a human being. But then I remembered the golden rule: Stanley Kubrick doesn't do anything by accident. The greatest films are the ones that can be more closely equated as ~experiences.~ We as the audience find ourselves in a paradoxical discomfort similar to our anti-hero. Alex, who lusts for violence, agrees to undergo an experimental therapy to "cure" him of criminal urges. In a nutshell, that boils down to him having something like a super-panic-attack every time he tries to commit violence. Meanwhile, we as the audience have a natural inclination to seek a redeeming or relatable quality about the person whose story we're following, but find ourselves contrarily disturbed by a pass-time that a lot of people solely categorize as entertainment. Along with endless phallic imagery, Kubrick makes a bold statement by intentionally including all sexual activity to be associated with rape, and thus violence. This coincides with the coincidence (?) of Beethoven's music being included in the background of Alex's therapy, thereby making him sick at the sound of his once-beloved symphonies. I had to take several breaks in the midst of watching this. Don't forget that it's actually healthy for you to be perturbed by some of the things you see.
The closing credits with simple text and one bright colored background.... Yes please.
Definitely horrifying but also an experience that's hard to forget. I'm not sure if that's good or bad.
Commentary
Alex be like: can I borrow a egg
I always have a harder time getting through the last forty minutes of this than the first 80. Darkly comic to the point of savage— as the back 3rd starts to mirrior its first, it starts to feel more like a philosophical exercise than a film that grabbed me by the bollocks — instead of laughing at the jokes, I start thinking, “isnt Mr. Kubrick quite the clever fellow?” and I’m taken out of the world he’s created. Seems to have fallen just a touch in my eyes with subsequent viewings over the years.
wtf is going on  my gulliver is hurting  so why has this so crazy.
A cold, dystopian nightmare. Kubrick has a particular way of visualizing his films as I've noted several times now. 'A Clockwork Orange' truly feels like a dystopia, looking completely out of its time and instead placed somewhere in the future. It is a tough film to categorize... it's a biting social satire with dramatic moments, but also feels like a very darkly humorous comedy with a horrifying rape scene set to "Singin' in the Rain" thrown in for good measure. I would argue the film still comes across as being very modern today, much less in 1971. I come away with new observations and a new perspective every time I take in the film, and because of that the film has surpassed its initial controversial reviews to become the cult classic it is today. It's not Kubrick at his best, but it might be Kubrick at his most entertaining.

Was inspired to revisit this after listening to the most recent episode of the Unspooled podcast, hadn't seen it since my college days (early 2000s), as a teen when I was getting into movies this was one of my first favorite Kubrick films (along with The Shining), I even had a poster on my bedroom wall, it's a fun a movie, especially those first 45 minutes where all the iconic scenes take place (the ultra violence), I always forget that the bulk of the film deals with Alex's rehabilitation, but honestly that is where the true meat to the story lies, this is a masterfully constructed film, its imagery is just as potent as its allegory, the use of music and 70s wallpaper designs is incredible, and the prison scenes with Chief Officer Barnes seem like a dry run for R. Lee Ermey in Full Metal Jacket. "Shut your filthy hole, you scum!" Not one of my favorite Kubrick films anymore, not even in the top 5, but that speaks more to the strength of Kubrick's body of work than anything about the quality of Clockwork itself, ya droogs.
This fantastic 1971 crime film based on the novel by Anthony Burgess follows the young protagonist Alex, who is fascinated by committing violent crimes such as robbery, rape, and assault, as he is arrested and is mentally altered by a brainwashing experiment known as the "Ludocivo's technique" created by the government. This film is definitely not for the faint of heart, as it features many disturbing and somewhat explicit scenes of violence and rape. However, this film is extremely entertaining, and will keep the audience's attention easily. There are many odd and shaky camera angles used throughout the film, and lots of interesting lighting choices. I would reccomend this film to viewers who want a very twisted and disturbing but also intelligent and creative film.
Malcolm McDowell and Jack Nicholson need to be a film together.
I like the exploration of personal agency in this film. Is there ever a circumstance where someone's ability to choose for themself should be taken away from them?
if i hadn’t read the book beforehand, i probably would’ve hated this. but i’m really glad Kubrick decided to stay faithful to this one (sorry Stephen) and the extreme violence and sexual content actually made the themes hit home harder
It's much more but obscure. It shows how the human brain can be manipulated, in a way where it manipulates the audience. Simply telling how the brain is ticking. It's not for everyone, because it's so offensiv and sometimes even disgusting. So maybe I'm one of the "not everyone" and therefore I couldn't enjoy it, that much.
No time for the old in-out love, I’ve just come to read the meter.
Makes sense Dim and George would turn out to be cops.
Where do I start... the complexity of the sets in the movie... from the narration.... to the execution of the nadsat language from the novel.... I absolutely love this movie. No scene in this movie was unnecessary and every scene was beautiful and intricately created.
Imagine showing this movie to Beethoven and asking him what he thought of Kubrick’s use of his ninth symphony.  He’d be all “Warum bewegt sich dieses Gemälde?”
Kubrick truly is one of, if not the greatest of all-time.
Kubrick’s punk rock film. It was the shortest film shoot he’s ever done and it has a rushed, sloppy look to much of it (long, luxurious zooms and dollies notwithstanding).  I never realized how funny it is.  If you take the entire thing completely seriously you are missing the tone of the film.  Yes, it’s artistic and yes, it has something to say about humanity and morality, but it also has dick jokes, slapstick, gratuitous nudity and violence and overacting for comedic purposes.  In my mind I composed a very long dissection of the film and its purpose and the ending and the film’s status in the world of 2018 but I realized  A) it would be too long and boring  B) this film has been analyzed and over-analyzed to death for the past 40 years.   Basically ACO is Anarchy In the UK.  A very British scream about the decline of civilization and warning against creeping totalitarianism with a charismatic young lead who’s also very dangerous but still funny.
I've seen this film multiple times, but I still struggle with it. I can appreciate that it is a great movie, but do I actually like it? I honestly don't know.
Alex, milk, beautiful movement, classical references, clear plot, a must watch movie before you die.
A young chelloveck givin an ol devotchka a bit of the in-out in-out yesss?
surprisingly turned out to be my favorite kubrick film? not sure how that happened
Malcolm Mcdowell once said:  ‘a clockwork orange makes an unpalatable character palatable’  ...but it’s 2018 and we don’t sympathize rapist
Up until now, I've always considered this to be a masterpiece of social commentary and dark humor, but on this rewatch, I was struck by just how dated and ridiculous it is. Kubrick serves up a dystopian future that appears as if Western civilization just stopped during the Mid-century Modern design movement and melded with grey British Milton-Keynes apartment blocks, then he populates this retro-mod-socialist world with a bunch of 2-dimensional stereotypes of hapless authority figures, ineffective parents, and pathetic delinquents wearing false eyelashes and jockstraps on the outside of their long johns. The "ultraviolence" practiced by these aforementioned criminal slackers is almost exclusively targeted towards women, grotesquely played for laughs, and choreographed to cheesy, Moog-y electronica courtesy of Walter (now Wendy) Carlos. I guess this was pretty shocking stuff back in '71, but today, it wouldn't frighten anyone outside of a Mennonite compound. I found Malcolm McDowell's performance particularly annoying. His use of "Nadsat" seemed egregiously false and unnatural, and his constant smirking and mugging didn't convey any sense of danger, but seemed more appropriate to some sort of pantomime. If you plopped Little Alex down in the middle of Chicago or Los Angeles today, some MS-13 gangbanger would probably pop a cap in his ass within 5 minutes. It isn't all a waste though. The questions it poses about free will being necessary to truly choose between good and evil, the inability of prisons to rehabilitate inmates, and how society transforms criminals into authority figures are just as pertinent today as they were back in '71.
Oddly not as impressed with this as I was last time I saw it in my 20s, but also really feeling like I need to watch it again soon.
i feel like this one gets way way way more praise than it deserves because of its director. the least kubrick could've done was present it from an angle that didn't feel sympathetic to these awful awful things that happen. ew. the author of the novel said it best himself: "We all suffer from the popular desire to make the known notorious. The book I am best known for, or only known for, is a novel I am prepared to repudiate: written a quarter of a century ago, a jeu d'esprit knocked off for money in three weeks, it became known as the raw material for a film which seemed to glorify sex and violence. The film made it easy for readers of the book to misunderstand what it was about, and the misunderstanding will pursue me until I die. I should not have written the book because of this danger of misinterpretation..."" anyway it's really really pretty to look at.
Wake up in the mornin' feelin' like Alex DeLarge Grab my droogs, I'm out the door, I'm gonna be in charge Before I leave, brush my teeth with a bottle of milk Cause when I leave for the night I'm gonna cut some silk I'm talking makeup on our eyes, eyes, Beating up other guys, guys Breaking into people's homes, homes, Get arrested, playing our favorite symphonies Getting aversion therapies, Trying to get a little bit tipsyyy... Don't stop, make heads pop Droogs, blow some people up Tonight, I'm-a fight Till we see the sunlight Tick-tock on the clockwork orange But wait, nothings rhyme with orange...ohhhh...ooo oo o oohhh...
Kindly take your "but you didn't get it" and shove it.
I thought I had watched this all the way through before, maybe when I was 16 or 17, but I hadn't. I guess this is fine? Maybe it's lost its shock value over time. Kubrick's weakest film that I've seen so far. Why is this always considered in the best movies of all time? It's in the Letterboxd and IMDb top 250 lists. Why? Just because it's a Kubrick film? Ugh. I have so many questions.
Cured of his sanity.
Honestly, I hate the aesthetic. The dialogue recording style is grating. I get what Kubrick is going for with a lot of this, and there's some admirable themes and iconic imagery, but I'm not sold on the execution. On the whole it was far from my favorite of his work.
I was a little confounded watching this now. Not about the story, but about how much I like it. I've seen it before, probably 20 years ago, much younger and liked it. (I read the book back then too.) And today, I still dig Kubrick, and even more enjoy things with a philosophical bent -- what is moral? -- but then so... why didn't I enjoy this more? I'm not sure. I think perhaps the irony is just pushed to such an extreme, call it ultra-irony, that it loses its touch. It feels like a cartoon, and perhaps just a little subtlety would have brought this back for me.
This movie covers a lot of complex themes and does it really well. The protagonist of the movie is unlike any I have seen before. The films makes the audience ask questions about, good and evil, free will, morals, and what is the price we are willing to pay to live in a "free society".
Alex DeLarge is the anti-hero of Stanley Kubrick’s classic dystopian fantasy, A Clockwork Orange. He is played with charismatic creepiness by Malcolm McDowell. He inhabits a grotesque London of the future, or perhaps an alternate-present. Alex leads his band of droogs (friends) on a series of antisocial and ultra-violent escapades. We look to the particulars of these crimes in an ultimately fruitless attempt to decipher what makes this guy tick. He brutally beats a street vagrant—perhaps he is motivated by contempt, or perhaps by a perverse desire to rid society of its more unpleasant elements. No, he then takes on a rival gang, doing similarly heinous stuff, though it is clear he does not care about saving his rival’s victims. Perhaps he’s seeking power, feeding his pride. When we get to the writer’s home, we witness Alex gleefully ransack a man’s home, beat him to a pulp, and brutally rape his wife all while singing ‘Singin’ in the Rain.’ While he does steal some money, greed hardly explains such repulsive and dehumanizing behavior. We do get some glimpses into Alex’s home life, and there’s certainly some bad parenting that has shaped Alex, but the film more-or-less avoids some kind of Freudian explanation of how his mommy and daddy made him a monster. Alex is a sociopath, plain and simple. Kubrick manages to sustain our interest in Alex by starving us of any alternatives. His companions, his family, his authority figures, and even his victims are either just as bad or impossibly remote. His corrections officer for example is clearly sinister and predatory. His parents are harmless, but are clearly so disconnected from what Alex actually is, that their obliviousness is an enabler. The writer and his wife, the victims of his most brutal act, are stultified caricatures. They don’t seem real. While not particularly evil (in this scene), they are certainly not good, and they are rather bland. While Alex is completely wicked, he is never bland, speaking to the audience articulately, imaginatively, and seemingly earnestly. Alex then has no competition for our interest. This perspective makes the first forty-five minutes of this movie a highly unpleasant experience. Following Alex’s relentless antics is ultimately degrading. By offering such a limited perspective, Kubrick is depriving us of choice. At this point, alarm bells should be going off: deprived of choice? Why, that’s the whole point of the movie! How brilliant this must be! And I suppose this line of thinking works—to an extent. After all, we will shortly find out, as the movie’s dialogue will clearly tell us, that depriving a being of free will is too high a price to pay for fighting crime. You see, Alex will soon be arrested, he’ll be institutionalized, and later will be selected for the “Ludovico technique.” This technique uses drugs and aversion therapy to essentially reprogram Alex, giving him severe illness associated with violent or sexually aggressive acts. The prison’s minister objects to the technique, as stated above, because of free-will concerns. The now-meek Alex is released to society, but things don’t go as planned. His parents have replaced him, and the rest of society is eager to take revenge. Beaten and tortured, Alex attempts suicide. This turns public sympathy his way, and he becomes somewhat of a celebrity. The government reverses the programming in exchange for his help with propaganda. The point is, we are led to believe, that there are important insights, and provocative themes at play here that justify Alex’s anti-heroism. These themes, I am told, are things like the nature of free-will, the importance of individuality versus the need to protect society, nature versus nurture, totalitarianism and institutionalism, to name a few. I don’t buy it. The suffering Alex undergoes in the last act of this movie is not a matter of his lack of free will. Rather, he suffers consequences of his prior acts. His inability to harm the homeless man doesn’t cause violence; the vagrant, in fact, seems willing to let him pass on his way, until he recognizes him as the man who had beaten him. Perhaps the free will does come into play in the fact that Alex lacks the ability to chose to defend himself. But in that case, the commentary is not all that insightful. Here, it’s an imbalance of free will that causes the suffering, ie the vagrant has the capacity to choose to beat Alex, but Alex lacks the choice to defend himself. Of course this is a rotten state of affairs, but more because of the unfairness than anything to do with the state of human nature. There is a strong case to be made that the capacity for free will is essential for human happiness. This is part of the theistic response to the problem of evil; that despite the fact that will often causes suffering, our capacity for free will itself is essential in order to avoid suffering and seek happiness. This movie never deals with any real ideas, all it does is set up sloganeering straw men and knock them down. It thrives on the more extreme manifestations of evil, but never considers virtue; never considers what it means to be good. It just retreats to a sort-of cult-worship of individualism. Ultimately, what we’re left with is rather brutal: the first act is Alex tortures society, the second act is government tortures Alex, and the last act is society tortures Alex, with a coda that suggests the government will team up with Alex to get the last laugh. It suggests some broad themes, but never really delivers. It’s as philosophically deep as a book-jacket summary of Beyond Good and Evil. This pretends to be a film about morality, but never gets past its own attitude. We’re left with an attitude of individualism and an attitude of constraint, but nothing of substance at the center. Early on, I referred to the movie as a classic, and I stand by that, even though I don’t like it much at all. Normally, a classic means something that stands apart among its class, something that has earned special recognition. As much as I object to this movie—and, really, I hate it—I can’t ignore its impact. It clearly resonated with audiences, not just upon its 1971 release, but it has endured. It means something to multiple generations. That doesn’t mean I’m wrong; an enduring reputation doesn’t mean a movie is necessarily good. But I do believe that I should approach this with humility. I don’t like it, I don’t connect with it, but I recognize it means a lot to a lot of people. My goal here is not to convince these people that they’re wrong, but simply to express my point of view.
not what i expected but in an oddly good way. basically about good vs bad and law and order but in the most unique way
So, here’s the thing. The book by Anthony Burgess is one of my favourite if not my favourite piece of literature. Even though I adore Kubrick and will forever praise his directorial genius I will never forgive him for not including the final chapter on the book in the movie. I was so upset by that decision that it very nearly ruined the film for me. However, I do think it is an amazing movie if you manage to separate it from the original source. Which I can’t. But I do recognise the impact it has had and I do think it deserves its place as a classic.
Having read the book before going into this film, i have to say I was not dissapointed. I believe that this was a very well done adaptation of a frankly shocking novel. The acting and visuals were spot on and had the same tone as when I read the book. The performance in this film was practically flawless in my personal opinon. Frankly, i love this film.
I watched this to see if I can predict what type of story "A Clockwork Orange" is. I'm quizzing myself because I want to perfect this ability to categorize stories. I got this idea from the book "The Seven Basic Plots," which suggests every story in human history falls within one such plot. I didn't anticipate this being among the most grotesque and disturbing movies I've seen. And unlike many other grotesque and disturbing movies, in this one the violence seems to exist for its own sake. Characters don't really change, the plot doesn't really move forward, and I guess I failed this quiz and also am a bit haunted before bed now. I wouldn't want to be around Stanley Kubrick on Halloween.
Rewatched for this week's episode of Unspooled. I've often thought about how Kubrick made 2001 as his sci-fi movie, Dr. Strangelove as his satire movie, and the Shining as his horror movie, and they happen to be among the best sci-fi, satire, and horror films ever made, respectively. In that spirit, A Clockwork Orange feels like Kubrick's B movie. It has the feel of an exploitation film, with gratuitous violence and nudity. Although much of the violence and sex is crucial to the story, there are places where nudity is seemingly thrown in just to be there, which really gives it a 60s/70s sexploitation feeling. Secondly, all the performances are quite a bit...extra. From Aubrey Morris's portrayal of probation officer Mr. Deltoid flailing and grabbing Alex's crotch, to Patrick Magee's Mr. Alexander screaming at Alex at the table, to Malcolm McDowell himself in the exaggerated chewing scene that closes the film, it feels like everyone was instructed to be broad. Whether or not this was the intention, it gives the film a cheesy B movie quality in my opinion. And to be sure, it's among the better B movies, but I still struggle with whether that means it's great. I downgraded this a half a star upon this viewing, though I still think there are a lot of interesting filmmaking choices to talk about. Maybe someone in the podcast or on the Unspooled forum will convince me to reassess and give that half star back.
I think I’m settling on the realization that, with few exceptions, Kubrick is not the filmmaker for me. Too didactic, too much thumbing his nose at the audience, too many performances pitched at wildly different levels - from horrible overacting to completely non-emotive.  But what about this film. To start, I don’t know what to make of his specific choice of style. Lots of sex and horrific violent thorough (yes, I think he’s conflating rape with sex...topic for another essay).   But, he’s making a clear choice, particularly in the first half, to make it all look so...cool, for lack of a better word. (Believe me, I’ve tried to think of a better word) Tall shadows. Slow motion fighting set to Beethoven. Perfectly lit and composed shots.  Attractive actors. The rape scene at the beginning is literally set on a lit stage with the motions of the people looking almost like a West Side Story dance fight.  Why the contrast of horific acts with such stylized filmmaking?  What is the intention of this choice?  Clearly there are options on how to depict this if the intent is to make us horrified. If I’m feeling generous, I’d guess that he’s saying something about the casual introduction of sex and violence into art and where the boundaries are or should be.  Not sure if it’s this, or he just can’t resist making things look all stylish and cool.   For my art theory:  I mean, the  murder scene has a duel between a phallic and a statue of Beethoven. And then his cure also leaves him unable to appreciate his favorite art. A bit on the nose, frankly.     But I don’t think he does much with these ideas. It seemed abandoned at the half way point- somewhere after the unnecessarily long scene where the prison guard exchanges receipts with the doctor (thumbs nose at audience). The end half is a distorted morality play where he is visited by all his past victims. And then the government regulates the deranged work of a writer of subversive literature and makes an alliance with Alex to appease the masses. Feels like Kubrick is making one  last salvo at this art commentary, this time pulling government into the mix.   In the end, a bit of a mess. Half baked ideas without really committing to any of them. But I’m sure I just don’t get it ,man, cause Kubrick is a super genius who’s just filming three dimensional chess.
A Clockwork Orange is a landmark dystopian film from acclaimed filmmaker Stanley Kubrick. The film follows Alex de Large as a small gang leader who commits crimes, gets imprisoned, and becomes reformed and rehabibilitated. The film's usage of on screen violence and graffic nudity and sexual acts have garnered substantial controversy. The film, sonically and visually is quite brilliant. Like many Kubrick works, the attention to detail is remarkable. Every set piece, every frame, and every use of dialogue is crafted nicely. The dialogue, is quite unusual. The vocabulary is abnormal and unique, using words foreign to way normal people speak. The wacky work choice is just so strange to modern viewers, it definitely takes time to get used to. The character of Alex is a very iconic one. Malcolm McDowell delivers a great performance which headlines his career. His transformation or the lack there of, goes hand in hand with this film. The film is as nightmarish as it is humoring. The script allows some comic aspects but the cold story grounds it. The film is very striking but still leaves something to be desired. The thematic elements, social and political topics, and disturbing imagery are all explored well in detail. The film just isn't lasting for me. It's an extremely well made film, but it doesn't rank as highly as other Kubrick films.
Where's my Basil?
HORROR x52 Challenge (2018) - #41: Rewatch #01 “It's funny how the colors of the real world only seem really real when you viddy them on the screen” A Clockwork Orange will cause your tick-tocker to race. An absolute sinny horrorshow for the ages. Kubrick understands how to make the viewer feel like a detail in a overwhelming landscape of strack and terror. This is easily one of the most misunderstood cine’s I’ve ever encountered, and to a degree I can viddy why. It’s as if your omny has to be tuned to the correct channel before being able to appreciate this zammechat worldcast. If you haven’t experienced A Clockwork Orange, I suggest you pour yourself a tass of the old moloko and nachinat right away. Listen closely to the warbles and prepare for some ultraviolence.
My entry for 1971 for my series on the defining films of the New Hollywood Movement: Personal Thoughts: It had been over a decade since I last watched A Clockwork Orange, but rewatching it for this project, I found that my feelings on it are more or less the same as they were the first few times I watched it; it's certainly a very unique movie, and one that I have a lot respect for, but not really one I love, unfortunately. To get my negatives out of the way first, I suppose I could mention how it occasionally tries just a bit too hard to be shocking and "edgy" (such as the end credits using the actual original recording of "Singin' In The Rain" after the film radically, let's say, "recontextualized" that particular song earlier), or how on-the-nose some of the film's delivery of its themes are (you could even say it's a bit (gulp) Nolan-y at times in that regard) but those are minor issues when put next to my main complaint about ACO, which is how unnecessarily over the top its general sensibilities are. Part of that may be due to the style of the film feeling occasionally self-indulgent, but Kubrick's direction here, for the most part, is rather effective in its trippy, nightmarish tone, so that aspect of the film definitely helps more than it hurts on the whole; rather, the main problem is with how ridiculous and exaggerated so many of the supporting performances in the film are, especially in the second half. You see, when comparing Clockwork to the rest of Kubrick's body of work, I feel that the various over the top bits of acting in something like Dr. Strangelove actually contributed something positive to that particular film, as they served the movie as a whole, and worked to illustrate the inherent absurdity of "mutual assured destruction" as a policy of national defense. Heck, even the extremely under the top performances in 2001 served to demonstrate the theme that mankind in that film had become jaded and lifeless, even in the wonderous future they inhabit. On the other hand, the needlessly exaggerated histrionics of Clockwork, whether it be the obnoxious simpering of Alex's probation officer, the random, abrupt screaming of the chief prison guard, or the incessant quivering of the writer's barefaced rage (whose actor actually asked Malcolm McDowell if his performance was too over the top) don't serve to do anything but make the film more tedious to watch, makes the characters feel phony and inauthentic, and only removes the film even further from the reality that its attempting to comment on, which, when you consider the already heightened, futuristic dystopia it takes place in, was an entirely unnecessary decision on the part of Kub. Besides that main quibble, however, I have to say that A Clockwork Orange is still fundamentally a pretty good movie on the whole, and one well worth watching for any film fan, as the production design maintains a nice balance between urban decay and sleek, alien futurism, a contrast that we really don't see enough of in sci-fi, the themes, while, again, are occasionally too obvious and self-conscious in their delivery, still pack some potent messages on the nature of free will, whether nature or nuture is the more important factor in determing the kind of people we become, and whether true inner rehabilitation and change is possible for human beings, and the style of the film works wonderfully for the most part, with Wendy Carlos's sinister, disorienting synthesized score striking an appropriately dystopian tone, the sequences of Alex's intense, kaleidoscopic hallucinations get us more intimate than we ever wanted to with the droog's sick, twisted brain, and John Alcott's cinematography is constantly, unusually kinetic in its movement without ever drawing too much attention to itself. My complaints about the overacting aside, A Clockwork Orange is still a unique as hell, one of a kind experience otherwise, and one you won't have to have your eyes pried open to stay awake for, that's for sure. Significance To The Movement/Cinema As A Whole: Despite his directorial career beginning well before the start of the New Hollywood era, Kubrick still showed 2001 was no fluke, and that he was more than keeping pace with the rest of the movement with Clockwork, as, besides the film's aforementioned experimental, surreal overall style, which makes it feel the most "New Hollywood" of any of Kubrick's films from the period, and the fact that it was one of the highest-grossing releases of the year, it was also nominated for four Oscars including Best Director and Best Picture, showing that the Academy of old was actually much less conservative at the time that it has become in recent decades. That fact is even more impressive when you consider just how much nudity, rape, and the ol' "ultra-violence" the film contains, which actually netted it the dreaded "X" rating at the time, and which, in addition to to the film's anti-government, anti-authority bent (which kept it in perfect spirit with much of the rest of the movement) results in yet another transgressive, boundary-pushing New Hollywood film, and arguably the most iconic one of its year, which is saying something, as you'll soon see below... Other significant New Hollywood films from '71: '71 saw a ton of other notable NH releases, including Robert Altman's McCabe And Mrs. Miller, a gorgeous, haunting Revisionist Western (and before you ask, I did bother to watch it before I wrote this, thank you very much), Peter Bogdanovich's coming-of-age tale The Last Picture Show, one of saddest, most emotionally devastating films I've ever seen, and my new personal favorite from the year (and also just one of my favorite films, period), Sam Peckinpah's grisly home invasion thriller Straw Dogs, Hal Ashby's Harold And Maude, a macabre, morbidly funny tale of a particularly odd May-December "romance", and a pair of notable police thrillers in the form of Don Siegel's iconic, influential Dirty Harry, and William Friedkin's Best Picture-winning The French Connection. And all of that's without even mentioning Alan Pakula's proto-erotic thriller Klute, Clint Eastwood's directorial debut Play Misty For Me, George Lucas's cold, dystopian sci-fi THX 1138 (which also his cinematic debut as well), Mike Nichol's Carnal Knowledge, or Jerry Schatzberg's addict drama Panic In Needle Park, which featured the first starring role from some guy named Al Pacino; you may have heard of him.
what. the. actual. fuck?
I feel like I need to rewatch this to truly judge it. Can’t wait to listen/watch some analysis videos of this later today. My initial reaction is wow. I think Kubrick is truly exploring the essence of Nature vs. Nurture here. This movie has really made me realize how much Kubrick enjoys exploring duality in the human essence
“this movie is a bit unusual really"  – my confused and slightly alarmed roommate
I liked this so much less this time around. I just felt that it didn't have much to say, however visually stunning it might be. If you're going to be about violence I feel like you need to have something worth saying.
he need some MILK (i thought of this and then saw that someone else did too and now i’m sad)
Seriously? Did I miss something?
Stanley Kubrick’s ‘A Clockwork Orange’ is a controversial, provocative and offensive masterpiece about the art of violence. This is an interesting film to study if you’re new or familiar with Kubrick’s filmography. Most people that have already seen the film hold some strong opinions regarding this story with a wide variety of responses to the darker material displayed throughout. The film is often regarded as one of the most controversial films ever made and there’s some genuine truth to that statement. After revisiting the film, I still have some minor issues with it, but the experience is undoubtedly a satisfying cinematic revelation. Kubrick has a unique method in which he tells his stories about violence without actually exploiting them or exaggerating them. In ‘Dr. Strangelove’, violence and war is frequently discussed but we never see a violent act until the final flurry of atomic bombs exploding in the background. In ‘2001’, HAL 9000 terminates an entire crew in a chilling way as we see a computer screen indicating the loss of life. Now, with this film, Kubrick actually shows us a story centered around violence, but directed in an artistic way that is still impressive to this day. The film centers on Alex, the dark soul of a leader with his gang of 'droogs’ set in a near future dystopian version of Great Britain. The gang moves from one location to the next terrorizing their victims, putting them through outrageous acts of violence including fighting, rape and murder. When two of his ‘droogs’ refuse to follow Alex’s path of destruction, he turns on them and beats them senseless. There’s a turn of events against Alex as he’s taken down by the medical industry who decides to “reform” his formerly sociopathic tendencies with a controversial treatment. Once Alex is cured, he faces a chain of humiliating evets that continually beat him down. He’s now being attacked by his former associates, the police, even some of his prior victims. Sometimes the cure is far worse than the illness as Alex learns the hard way that karma can indeed be a cruel bitch. There’s a level of appreciation to the affection and habitué concepts of the story, as well as the types of questions it raises for us as the audience. The film lends itself to many psychological ideologies about freedom, choice, good versus evil and selfishness which is quite thought-provoking. Despite the complete inability to relate to Alex as a character, there’s a carefully crafted layer of self-exploration that I’ve always found fascinating in this film. Malcom McDowell’s performance as the lead felt hauntingly authentic, there’s isn’t a moment where his character feels like he’s pretending, or even acting for that matter, it’s very convincing and commanding. Kubrick's direction is handled masterfully throughout the film and it shows, his presence is made in every frame as the overall presentation of the film does a remarkable job of sucking you into this horrible dystopian world with a great attention to detail. The film’s only real detriment is due to its own controversy which is indeed disturbing in nature and not intended for everyone to see, I understand that. The disturbing tone of the film is vital to its execution, it doesn’t hold back at all, even during the fighting, killings and especially the rape scenes which makes it an incredibly difficult film to watch let alone recommend to others. I find rare films with such a disturbing nature like this fascinating and is one of the reasons why I can always appreciate a filmmaker that isn’t afraid to hold back. Cinematic storytelling can be thought-provoking and immoral, but a lot of complaints about the film is that it goes too far and damages the viewer, to each their own there. Kubrick is a filmmaker that should be studied as his films offer incredible transcendent experiences, ‘A Clockwork Orange’ just happens to burn a hole in your conscience in the process. As I said before, the criticism the film receives for being controversial and offensive is understandable, I may not feel that same way, but I get it. I understand the strong opinions about the film as they are all over the board with reactions. After this recent rewatch, I still consider the film to be one of Kubrick’s better works and should be given a screening by any cinephile or aspiring filmmaker that’s willing to give it a chance. See it for yourself, don’t let any outside influence dictate that decision for you. Like most of Kubrick’s films, relying on someone’s opinion doesn’t really do his cinematic experiences any justice as a lot of his films are self-exploratory. I wouldn’t just watch it only because it’s controversial or offensive, you should watch it for its darker essence of artistic merit. Overall, ‘A Clockwork Orange’ is a dramatically difficult to watch but visually impressive social satire. The film has comedic moments, torturous scenes, deconstruction of musicals during a horrifying rape, it’s a hybrid of material and definitely not an easy film to categorize. It may feel out of time and out of place, but it’s a stunning portrayal of the art of violence and nearly impossible to take for granted. Kubrick’s approach to this subject matter is handled excellently with masterful direction and thought-provoking concepts of this dystopian version of the near future. This is a film that can and should be studied, this is a film that demands multiple screenings, this is a film that challenges your perspective on art and violence, this is pure, modernistic cinema.
The power of the internet is powerful
Proof positive above all else that Kubrick had bigger yarbles than you, if you even have yarbles. Read Anthony Burgess’ book in high school and first saw this in college. Disagreed with the notion that it glorified violence but wondered if I still would, and if so why. I still do, and the answer is that Kubrick knows precisely how much distance to place between you and his subject: what to show, what not to show and exactly how to do both. Everything that you do see is exaggerated beyond belief, from the supporting performances to the wide angle lenses and especially the production design, a deliberately garish bastard child of brutalism and pop art. However, Kubrick keeps the camera cool and collected, and even when he puts it in the thick of the action it feels somehow removed. Interestingly, we’re never really with Alex anytime he follows the old ultraviolence through to completion; we cut to the next scene after he wraps up “Singin’ in the Rain”, and in other cases Kubrick moves to a safe distance to spare us the details. Even in the attack on the old woman, arguably the most Kubrick lets us partake in the proceedings, the killing blow is depicted symbolically rather than literally. It’s a clever strategy, one that lets the audience see Alex’s evil without turning them off from following his journey. Yet despite that, and despite Malcolm McDowell’s extraordinary charisma, the Nadsat conlang of Burgess’s text keeps you from empathizing with him; it’s hard to connect to a guy when you have to actively figure out what he’s saying. With all these pieces in place, Kubrick has free reign to mount maybe his single most daring movie, boldly transposing Burgess’ questions of morality and free will to make the fullest exploration of his own themes: power, control and dehumanization. It’s a deeply disturbing vision, one only accentuated by his post-2001 comfort with ambiguity, so is it any surprise it set off people’s alarm bells? Argue over its validity or coherence all you want, we’ve been doing so for almost fifty years now and we’re not stopping anytime soon. Real horrorshow.
Loved it. Malcolm McDowell’s performance is really something to behold. I can imagine being given a role like this at 27 years old must have been quite the physical and mental undertaking. Also, I loved the “easter eggs” thrown in. And no, I’m not just talking about the one in the music shop scene. If you know your Kubrick, you’ll pick up on some more obscure ones.
70s interior decorations: the most disturbing part of this film.
I liked this more than I liked The Shining, can’t wait to read the book. Never would I have thought this would be one of my new favorite psychological thrillers.
This movie is horrific and wild trip. Even crazier now than when I first saw it. Still it’s hard not to love a bit of the old ultraviolence.
What if Monty Python was dark, tedious, and shitty?
this is a movie about how white boys are the root of all evil
No, a clock works with gears! Art direction, cinematography, camera work: nice The script and any time the characters converse in their silly British way: yawn
Yeah, I have no idea. It’s violently unpleasant, but extremely stylish and uses music super well, and it has a provocative message that it explicitly spells out for you at the expense of having literally anything else to grasp onto. I’m sure it’s much, much better than I’ll give it credit for
A rich and disturbing dystopia with exceptional attention to detail in production design and costume, incredibly edited, great soundtrack and extraordinary performance from Malcolm McDowell.   While there is a lot of graphic content in this film, for me, It’s the film sympathies that makes this such a highly disturbing experience. From the beginning, the film imbues Alex with a sense of charismatic everymanship. We follow him and watch his horrific acts, and the film continues to treat him his way. We follow him through the corrupt and immoral prison and rehabilitation system as his sadistic spirit is crushed, we follow him in his desperation and fear during his comuppances. We are horrified, at ourselves and the society on film, because we remain by his side.  We understand him and his world and that is what makes him terrifying. For me, the film is ultimately great because it centers the questions of freedom and order on a character rather than a society. 🥛
I’d been dying to see this film for a while. As a film major, it was quite criminal that I HADN’T seen this yet. So leave it to my Film History class to show it as curriculum!  First off, let me just voice the fact that I was not disappointed. This movie was just as weird as I anticipated it to be.  Kubrick’s use of imagery and sound really helped contribute to just how bizarre of an experience watching this movie was. From the sexually charged milk bar Alex and his droogs frequent, to theseemingly trashed apartment complex Alex lives in, to the almost overwhelming synthesized background music, everything about the sets and sounds had me consistently wondering what I was supposed to be watching. I’m aware A Clockwork Orange was supposed to be an overwhelming film, and it certainly lived up to that standard. Next to that, aside from it’s surrealness, the movie was also really successful in making me sympathize with a character who would otherwise be seen as villainous. Alex was a rapist, an assaulter, a murderer, and a vandal. Yet after he went through the therapy, and after everybody he wronged came back to make his life hell, I couldn’t help but feel bad for him. He probably deserved it, but at the same time, I couldn’t help but root for him a little. It was a very odd sensation for me; I normally have a low tolerance for people who commit those kinds of acts, but Kubrick did well in making sure I felt something for Alex.
Rewatched for the umpteenth time because Bowie’s Nadsat song from Blackstar got me in the mood.  Still wonderful, still hypnotic, still has a woman dying from giant, artsy, ornamental Penis. In fact, I’d dare go so far as to say giant, artsy, ornamental penis/10
A pretty faithful adaptation on Anthony Burgess’ novel that also happens to be a cinematic masterpiece. Visually striking, sickening, thought-provoking, and intriguing, this is one of my favorite Stanley Kubrick films and one that I’ll have to rewatch to pick up any details I may have missed during the first viewing.
A crazy world for a mixed up time, don't mess with the symphony. A film that takes you outside yourself and inside a mind that is at once mad and sane, knowing and yet naive. Powerful and needing more than one viewing to appreciate just what it is you've just seen
What didn't click Stanley? What didn't click
An amazing movie. It’s very dark, disturbing and....ultra violent. One of Kubrick’s best films, and one of the best character studies in film. A must watch.
Stanley Kubrick is a true master: every shot was amazing and I couldn’t take my eyes off this journey through a fucked up society and mind.
Much more enjoyable on second watch, and a bit more clear in my head, but I still feel I can't like "A Clockwork Orange" as much as the majority. But it still intrigues me and I'll probably be back to it. This time I got a new appreciation for the cinematography and that fucking score. Simply incredible.
This is the third film I’ve seen from Kubrick and he continues to prove that he’s my favorite director.  A Clockwork Orange presents a dark and disturbing futuristic scenario where groups of hoodlums roam the streets at night, assaulting anyone who crosses their path. The progression of the story and the way it made me feel was remarkable. It honestly felt like a different film going into the second act but I loved it so much. The fact that I could still feel sympathy for the main character after everything he had done just proves the genius of this film. Kubrick is 3 for 3 so far where perfect films are involved, and I’m hoping this streak will keep going. Please check this film out, but don’t expect to feel any sort of positive emotion. 10/10
An absolute masterpiece that I simply can’t praise in my own words.
Technically? Brilliant, Kubrick ennit? Ideologically? Not so much. Confused ain't I?
🏴‍☠️🔸👁🃏🕑🔶 Clockwork Orange:    "..has the appearance of an organism lovely with colour and juice but is in fact only a clockwork toy to be wound up by God or the Devil...”  it isnt the best movie ever...it’s the weirdest.
heck yes. as dope as i thought it would be.
the part of my brain that registers bastard men as attractive didn't turn off :// Alexander DeLarge call me :///
Absolutely nothing needs to be said about this. It would just seem trite to go on about it being a masterpiece-which it is-and if I added any more to what every one who's a fan already knows, it wouldn't make it any more or less true.
Stanley Kubrick did that, period but doesn’t mean I liked it. A thought pervoking movie that is real disturbing and graphic, it really deals with important topics but it’s a slog to get through. Violence is bad, but brainwashing someone so they can’t get violent at all is also bad and problematic. Criminal reform is hard to achieve, but the way things played out in this movie was not it. Gotta give points to Stanley Kubrick for the ambition on display as always.
It's a very important work of art. High points: Everything. It's flawless. Low points: Nothing. It's flawless.
Some nice Kubrick shots and compositions...BUT overall probably one of my least favorite Kubrick films.
stop making like seriously criminal characters hot i'm going to lose it! nice satire and also nice posing of ethics in psychology
My dad says this is the most sick and twisted movie he's ever seen, yet I think this is my favorite Kubrick film, thereby saying it's one of my favorite films period. Yikes. Engaging from start to finish. The closest to reality, yet with enough detail to give it a fantastic nature to it. Alex is perhaps the Anti-Hero of all anti-heros. If I were still in school and I were just *forced* to write a comparison or change over time essay regarding some characters, I'd look at how Alex influenced the character type of the Anti-Hero [namely that of Hannibal in The Silence of the Lambs??]. I digress. The use of violence in the movie is quite different to what we see today. Rather than make everything hyper-realistic or ultra-grotesque, Kubrick pulls some fancy tricks. He speeds things up. He overlays circus music over the acts. He inserts bits of comedic dialogue. He uses a wide-angled lens, from Alex's vantage point mostly, to signify a POV, which gives the viewer itself a sort of detached look at the violence. Put that with everything else and it almost makes the violence come off as a charade, separate from the reality of what's really going on in the film. Still, some of the violence makes me ill and no, I'll never be able to listen to Singin' in the Rain thanks to this movie.
This movie was immensely disquieting to say the least. A very compelling story. The main character, Alex, has got to be one of the most complex and intriguing movie psychopaths. Love this movie.
well.... i had to watch this for a film studies project and um the cinematography and plot was really good so i guess i liked it??? alex looked like evan peters which was strange so thats all i got folks
one of the weirdest films I’ve ever watched but I still liked it I think, kubrick had a very unique and creative mind  *if they ever remake this (hopefully not) they really need to cast evan peters as alex because that resemblance is mad
the concept of how a violent government perpetuates a violent society is very topical in today’s political environment, but Jesus Kubrick you really dislike/hate women huh?
it’s just... gratuitous.  Directing and cinematography? Great.  Narrative? Long, trope-y, shocking for the sake of being shocking in some parts, doesn’t really work nowadays.  I’m sorry Kubrick, but not a fan of this one.
A Clockwork Orange isn’t even a horror movie but somehow it manages to disturb me more than any horror movie ever could.
Morally repugnant and juvenile; inarguably, one of the worst things to happen to the medium. (Burgess's animosity towards this is entirely justified in my eyes.) Disheartening that generations of film-goers will grow up enslaved to the ludicrous notion that Kubrick is some infallible genius. He isn't.
lol I’m learning about classical and operant conditioning in psychology class right now
Well, I wasn't floored. There was violence that nearly 50 years ago felt controversial, today it feels okay. There are a few standout sets and scenes, and it's now felt like watching a master direct in peak form. I watched the Shining the day before and the Shining is still in my thoughts. This surely won't hold a large place for me, mainly because the characters growth or decline wasn't something I cared about, violence for fun never makes a character appealing, I had hoped I'd say more layers out of the personality, the narration given sounds numbed, or as if I'm in on something. I did, initially, find three fight scenes not brutal but pointless, and pointless violence can frighten.
Michelle Handleman’s Must Watch List #3  The set, the score, and the cinematography were the best things about this film. Other than that I wasn’t really into it.
absolute bangey wangey my brothers and sisters
"It's funny how the colours of the real world only seem really real when you viddy them on the screen."  This was one of the first films I watched when I started to get into film in sixth grade... and it terrified the shit out of me when I was that young. It still does
Really forgot how unsettling this movie is, whoa man
This film is fantastic and all, but I'm just so curious about that Vampire version of Alex. I swear if there was just one full scene with him as a vampire, this would be the best film ever.
I'm not sure what to say about this movie other than that the 2nd time watching it I understood everything much better. Which oddly enough goes for every one of Stanley Kubricks films
Am I a bad film hoe or is this...not good?
I’ve been thinking about Alex saying “eggiwegs...” for like two days now.  My mom once told me this was her favorite movie, which is just about the coolest.
The cogney accents are stronger than I remember
One of the greatest movies of all time in my opinion. Liked it after the first watch, absolutely loved it after the second time. It's so shocking and horrifying that it's somehow so addicting. Could not watch this movie enough.
Now I see what all the hype is about! Kubrick created a masterpiece. It was in your face, it was frightening, but I loved it. Anyone who loves to see karma bite someone in their ass would love this classic. You would also love this film if you enjoy absolute craziness! It is not politically correct at all so soft eyes probably would not care for this film but damn what a watch. The vision and camera work is incredible, but I mean what else do you expect from Kubrick? Hell of a movie for its time, definitely a must see.
This movie makes you wish you've seen it sooner. Everything about it is godlike, the pacing, the downward spiral of Alex's life, the flawless ending. Highly recommend
This movie is fucking sensational. Released in 1971 and banned in many countries until 2000 - A Clockwork Orange is as vicious and hypnotic as ever in 2018. Start to finish, this film just instantly blows me away. The narrator, Alex, is ferociously menacing and purely evil, yet still you can't help but be pulled into his world viewpoint and even feel sorry for him in places. How the visuals of this film come together with its immersive score and superbly crafted narration is a delight to behold. There is no dead weight, no throwaway moments. Everything feels perfected. The film's events are also completely realistic and natural. I have seen this film many times, but it is still impactful and horrific in places. It is also nice to see the entire film turn upside down in the second half. If you haven't seen it, then you've been living under a rock. And if you have, then going back will only remind you of its great power.
Am I your typical film student yet
alex: I came here to drink milk and kick ass... and I’ve just finished my milk
Another day, another film that tries to get you to sympathize for some terrible white man
I would not recommend reading the book before watching the movie, as I did. It's not a bad book by any measure, and I would absolutely recommend it, but Kubrick does a much better job of telling this story and espousing these ideas than Burgess. Apart from the portrayal of music and the parents, this surpasses the book in almost every way. Reading it first took much of the shock and confusion away from the film, and being that the film is far superior, this is very disappointing.      Even though I knew it was coming, I was still physically sickened by the first HOME scene.    I'm especially impressed by how Kubrick was able to encapsulate the last 10 or so pages within a single shot.   I'd like to watch this again when the book isn't so fresh in my mind, I imagine I'll enjoy it more.
A vile, grotesque, and relentless examination of the most barbaric and primal state of humanity. The score is ominous and perfect. The visuals are incredible, Kubrick’s futuristic dystopian aesthetic and combined with gritty and often snuff-like cinematography make A Clockwork Orange one of the most uncomfortable and detestable masterpiece ever created in the history of cinema.
nope. i am a firm believer that no film ever needs to include rape scenes, and kubrick is no exception to that rule. it’s just not okay. there’s a million other ways that it can be communicated without showing it, and it’s totally inconsiderate of survivors of abuse. not to mention the way women are objectified in general in this movie, yikes. people will undoubtedly say ‘but this was 1971, we can’t judge it by today’s standards’. but guess what? we can actually. it wasn’t okay then, and it isn’t okay now. sure, it came out a few decades ago, but if people keep giving films like this 5 stars, talking them up, and hanging the posters in their college dorm rooms then they are still as much a relevant cultural icon as any film that came out recently. and then the messed up messages it sends keep circulating in the world. we have to hold art accountable, even if it’s influential and lots of people like it.
This movie narrates a story of Karma: all the actions return to the doer, without any merci.
I continue to be struck by how much the man inside the Darth Vader costume once resembled a brolic Austin Powers. An incredibly immersive dystopia, this. The psychologist in the hospital with the word bubble test made me realize stan kubes predicted "space hair" two years after woodstock. Srsly tho it's real horrorshow how I'd almost rather have this world than mine due to its general lack of guns
Nothing I can say will do it justice, but alas, A Clockwork Orange is a brilliant satire on government and free will that is both entertaining and thought provoking in equal measures.  Grade: A
good thing i'm lactose intolerant
“Singin’ in the Rain” is better in this than in Singin’ in the Rain
Clever and organized but, compelling? Not really.
My ass hurts
Although I liked the music, the allegory and symbolism, the first half and the fact that it's a technically fantastic film, it really didn't hit me in any remarkable way. I really didn't feel anything, some parts were just straight up stupid and some of it was quite boring.
Mind, blown. Not for the squeamish. Or illiterate.
i wish i talked like this    turkey
I hate to trot out the old "________ is as relevant as ever..." refrain but is any movie apter for reexamination in our infinitely screwed up socio-political moment than A Clockwork Orange? In an age of ever-present white male violence and governments actively looking to reprogram its damaged populace with its own levers of cultural brutality- aided in large part to psychiatric drugs intended to suppress rather than substantially reform- Stanley Kubrick's 1971 tightly wound confection of unpleasantness continues to enact its terrors on eyeballs hopelessly laid bare to a world on the brink of collapse. Our definitions of authoritarianism have undergone significant revisions since the early 70s yet the acuity with which Kubrick critiques institutional terrorism as a reaction to, or quite possibly a root cause of, societal ills remains bone-chilling in its accuracy. However, this is not to suggest that A Clockwork Orange's rejection of its existence on an ideological spectrum vacillating between the tyrannical and the anarchic excuses the film for the flawed vision of the world's enactors of political violence it at times smugly dramatizes. The distance with which Kubrick frames his adaptation of Anthony Burgess's novel throws us into the action with little in the way of guide rails or signposts. Do not get me wrong, I love it when art challenges me personally without telling me exactly what or how to think. However, I also expect the work in question to take some measure of responsibility for the actions or expressions of the elements in play, something that I never feel as if the movie ever accomplishes much less expresses any interest in attempting. If anything, the remove with which Kubrick engages in the material grant an ever-refreshing modernity to a film that could easily date itself as little more than a talented auteur taking a stab at the flower children running amuck and the necessary measures employed to keep them in line. As it stands, A Clockwork Orange has stood the test of time as an unfortunately timeless valentine to dystopias large and small. Yay?
this shit wild but
I'm speechless...It's one of the weirdest films I have EVER seen and at the same time one of the most beautiful too. Malcolm McDowell gives easily his best performance as Alex, one of the most cruel but interesting characters of all time. Cinematography is very beautiful and directing is indescribably great. Anyway, I know this film absolutely isn't for everyone but please give a change for it, because it's so important piece of the history of motion picture and one of my favorite films of all time. 10/10
I'M SIIIIIINNNNGING IN THE RAIIIIN
While I can call this his weakest film overall, especially given the fact that I loved 2001: A Space Odyssey and The Shining, Stanley Kubrick's approach to A Clockwork Orange (1971) offers plenty of interesting visuals and a stylized way of seeing the story of one teenage boy learning the consequences and the true meaning of ultra-violence. Granted. The rape scenes were overkill and there were some many scenes I thought were so over the top and lame, but looking past aside those issues, the film can be watchable after at least 3 times.
It seems like this is one of those movies you just HAVE TO HAVE SEEN--right up there with STAR WARS and GONE WITH THE WIND. The thing is, I'd never seen it until it was in my FilmStruck library. Of course, I had read the book. Of course, I knew every reference David Bowie made to the work (so, droogie, don't crash here). Of course, I "got" every reference to this film as it was portrayed in other media...like the seemingly-endless references to it, in the 90s, on "The Simpsons." I just didn't know how DAMN GOOD it would be until I actually watched it. I didn't know how TERRIFIED it would make me. As a lover of classical music, this hit me more than anything else: Ludwig van's Ninth was a symphony highly influenced by the Enlightenment. And it's beloved by Alex, this child of a future, this evolved (but in what way?) being. And, to enlighten him, it's used to condition him. AND OH MY GOD THAT SCARED THE CRAP OUT OF ME.
I appreciate this more after distancing it from the novel
A controversial classic to be sure, but a classic none the less. One of the best book adaptations out there
A very good professional piece of cinnie. I viddy much enjoyed viddying this. And I talk like this now, my brothers
This was a less subtle Kubrick for me. The acting and directing were top notch, but the themes were too point blank for me. Still a good movie though.
It’s a shame I didn’t understand one thing of the book, because the movie is so great!!!
Really wonders what happens if we humans lose or right to be moral beings Such an amazing and profound movie, one of my favorite movies of all time
it was sick
In my opinion, Kubrick's greatest film. Period. Full stop. The cinematic features of the film and Malcolm McDowell's performance make this a film no movie buff will want to miss.
I think there’s supposed to be like seven sins or some shit but let’s be real the only sin that exists is rating this anything other than 5 stars  There’s also a really great short little documentary about the movie on the blu ray give it a watch if you’re a fucking worthless friendless piece of shit like me :)
Bursting with social commentary on topics from prison reform to gay rights, this film is one of Kubrick’s finest. 9.5/10
DISCLAIMER!!! I’m a sick motherfucker. So a sick motherfucking movie is just gonna click with me. I’m sorry, it’s just going to happen. I don’t know what else I can do for you.  This is one of the most weird, crazy, and “was the director on drugs” movie I’ve seen in a long time. For the first thirty minutes, you have absolutely no idea what’s going on. I love it. The opening scene gets me hooked immediately, with its distorted “For the Funeral Of Queen Mary” piece by Henry Purcell. You put that masterpiece with a scene of four weirdos with hats, and eyelashes, drinking milk on furnature made out of naked women manicans. That’s how you get me interested, IMMEDIATELY. The next scenes include beating up a homeless person, a rape scene, a gang fight, a rape scene, a teenager sleeping with a snake to Beethoven, an old man grabbing a teens balls, a sex scene, a fight, and almost another rape scene. AND THEN THE MOVIE BEGINS!  When Alex goes to prison, I start to feel really interested in him and what’s going on around him. This guy who seemed just like an absolute psychopath is started to show some composed personality. While this is happening I’m hoping that he becomes a better person, but while I’m hoping this, it seems the people around Alex get worse, and now it feels like Alex is the definitive protagonist. When he leaves prison his life becomes a living hell and suddenly I just fall in love with his character and I want him to succeed and it breaks my heart when bad thins happen to him.  I have no idea what this movie is about. It could be “is religion the only way to good morality” is it “the government is more evil than the evil doers themselves” is it “men are naturally born evil” Either way, the music is the best out of any movie and I know I’m being a little bit biased because my favorite piece “William Tell Overture” is in it. Three times, but this movie is super entertaining, in a way super meaningful, and I love the main character and his setting.  This definitely isn’t the fourth best movie in the world, but it certainly is my fourth favorite. I can rewatch it everyday. 5/5.
funny this works. largely because of mc dowell. appropriate for vacation with more and more violent films.
How much up it’s own ass can a movie truly be? Jesus christ.  had a lot of good elements working for it, but i think brady corbet doesn’t know how to manage them in a more humble and honest way of storytelling. a star is born dominates.  (i’m also drunkenly writing this)
The ending (or lack thereof) was ass. I really enjoyed everything else tho. But who knows! Maybe tomorrow I’ll wake up with a different opinion, or on a second watch it will sit better with me. The main thing I want to know is what I have to do in order to get Willem dafoe to narrate my life
BABY AVEC CASH  While also serving up an aggressively nihilistic middle finger to the very notion of humanism in the 21st century, Vox Lux raises its other middle digit towards the expectations and desires of conventional cineastes everywhere (as evidenced especially by the many oblivious — and not so oblivious but still sore — reviews on this very site), and I am here for it. This movie represents 21st century culture in a way that feels so, so depressingly, joyously, right. The antidote to A Star is Born’s pastiche of basic, moralistic takes on the same subjects. This review is dedicated to anyone who doesn’t like Natalie Portman’s performance, especially if you found it jarring, unlikable, or otherwise inaccessible. Scavenger Hunt #45 11/30 6. Watch a film with an actor/actress you dislike (Jude Law)
The fearless depiction of a school massacre remains one of cinema’s final frontiers. It is a subject matter so sensitive and easily exploited that when Brady Corbet opens his second directorial feature, Vox Lux, in 1999 with a gunman walking into a classroom and pulling the trigger on the teacher, the movie essentially says: Yes, this is going to be a provocative piece of filmmaking that will do justice to a taboo subject at long last. Corbet has come up with a terrific premise about an unlikely kind of celebrity that could emerge from a national tragedy. What’s disappointing is he turns that premise into a very cliched Behind the Music episode. Celeste (Raffey Cassidy), a survivor of the shooting, becomes an overnight sensation when she writes a song about the trauma and sings it at a funeral. The movie, however, is far more interested in showing Celeste perform and rehearse several numbers in their entirety than developing her character. Handed with little material to work with, Cassidy gives a wan performance, as if she were still playing the paralyzed daughter in The Killing of a Sacred Deer. And as written by Sia, the songs are fine, but every time the movie turns into a glorified music video, the story is at a standstill, which Corbet compensates by inserting overwritten narration from Willem Dafoe. After making an awkward connection to 9/11, the movie jumps to 2017 and finds Celeste, now played by Natalie Portman, as a jaded pop star complete with substance abuse issues and an estranged daughter (also played by Cassidy). Vox Lux links Celeste to another horrific act of violence, only much more tangentially this time, and Portman’s dressing room tantrums are at once generic and overacted. The movie then abruptly closes with a 15-minute concert sequence which manages to make the sight of Natalie Portman singing and gyrating to EDM in a catsuit shrill and tedious. In the end credits, Corbet dedicates the film to Jonathan Demme, which may explain the indulgent music scenes. Judging by Vox Lux, however, it appears Corbet may have taken stop making sense way too close to heart. Grade: D
🎶 i-, i-, i-, i- 🎶 🎶 i-, i-, i-, i- 🎶 🎶 i-, i-, i-, i- 🎶 🎶 i-, i-, i-, i- 🎶 I. Loved. This. Shot on gorgeous Kodak 35mm film stock that was treated so well!!! In the last couple of years most movies shot on 35mm end up looking identical to digital. Negatives are so cleaned up these days they end up erasing the precious texture and grain but Vox Lux got it soooo right. I read an interview with DP Lol Crawley where he mentions purposely underexposing and forced processing the film to invoke the specific reality the script and performances played in, and when films have that level of detail they immediately have a special place in my heart. This is a fucking gorgeous and stylish horror movie, and the story of a woman who’s character traits are usually given to male roles. Natalie and Stacy Martin are great, but I think the real standout performance here is 16 year old Raffey Cassidy. Sure, this movie has its flaws, but there’s soooo much here that works so well for me not to give it a perfect score. The editing, sound design, Scott Walker’s compositions and Sia’s pop ballads?!?! I was not prepared.
A movie directed by the little brother from Assasination Nation. Corbett did it for the lols. I’m 100 percent here for this mean, bitter, cynical assault on the senses, despite the lack of any real resolution. I’m not just speaking in the narrative sense though, as that seemed like it would be a given, but rather how let down I was that the movie was more about throwing out whatever messages it could moment to moment rather than actually having something coherent to say about gun violence or pop music or toxic celebrity psychology or any number of issues that it sets it sights on. It’s a big dumb mess, but hey so is America! So is pop music! Right guys? Is that my take? TBH it just might be! I love Portman, her face in this has such a specific angularity that makes everything she does seem so uniquely ill-timed and misguided. Just like in Jackie or Black Swan, she channels her characters’ grief into a million different little deviations from sanity in an incredibly watchable way. Also love my greasy king Jude Law and sad vanilla wafer Stacy Martin. All of these actors are so acutely attuned to the tone that Corbet is trying to set. The pitter patter of his self conscious, literary, kind of full of shit dialogue makes you feel like everyone on screen is supposed to represent something wrong with the way the world is. It’s honestly insane and I kinda can’t believe he pulled it off, especially on such a grand scale. Not for everybody of course, me and my buddy who was equally enamored with it could feel the air rushing out of the theater as we were watching it, and we were the only people seeing it. Desperate times, desperate measures maybe? Or maybe I’m just a sucker for Sia, in all of her relentless and vindictive glory!
... I can’t imagine what Celeste stans must be like.
When's the concert tour DVD coming out?
Natalie Portman is STUNNING in one of the best performances of her career (sorry, Black Swan). Takes a while to build and can be only slightly pretentious at times but otherwise is a fascinating, mesmerizing and dark look at America's obsession with celebrity and a life shaped by violence.
the best of 2018s “hey this is how an artist is an artist” movies. raffey cassidy and natalie portman are really good in this. Not a big fan of the opening but everything that came after it in act 1 was very interesting to watch and was really entertaining. Act 2 was not as strong but still really good i just wish they kinda set up that thing they reveal at the end more.
I really like a lot of things about this movie on paper.. but the execution on really all of them, is just incredibly bland in my opinion. I love slow dialogue driven movies. But a lot of the nuanced themes and messages of the movie didnt really feel earned or impactful.  I really wanted to love this movie, I was really looking forward to it. But I have a lot of issues with the script and directing. Some of it felt pretty corny, I honestly just wasn’t buying it, the transformation of Natalie Portman’s character from who she was to who she became. The best part about this movie to me was definitely the opening. Pretty disturbing and effectively done. But once we started getting to the pop industry side of the movie, it just all felt incredibly dry. This is coming from someone who listens to A LOT of (indie/art) pop. And loves a good character study or social commentary especially if I feel there’s a lot of depth into it. But yeah.. I didn’t get much out of this at all. Which is a shame, I wanted to love it. I just didn’t find anything really exceptional in the movie, I think Natalia Portman gave a great performance with what she had to work with, but ultimately her potential felt squandered, to me.  I love her in really everything I’ve seen her in, except this, but I don’t lay the fault on her shoulders at all.  Again, a lot of the narrative and commentary works on paper to me but I don’t feel like the movie executed it well.
It was a lot. But in the best way possible. Haven’t seen anything this refreshing in a while. Shocking. Heartbreaking in its absurdity. Also Natalie Portman was amazing?? Not a question, but a confused exclamation.
Had fun dancing in the theatre
WHAT..... this was just uhhhh. not necessary whatsoever. natalie portman was the only thing that made this film watchable. the direction is god awful. and a few scenes made me want to walk out of the theater. Don’t listen to anyone comparing this to I, Tonya. it’s not similar at all lmao.
While a film with a lot of flaws, the pros outweigh them considerably
this one's a bit of a head-scratcher for me. on the one hand, the music's great (sia's impact!), the visuals are specTACular (the title and end credits are delicious to look at), willem dafoe's narration adds a surprising amount of dramatic heft to the story, and it's one of the most ambitious, intense, and thematically daring films i've seen this year. on the other hand, its emotional impact is a bit stunted (mostly due to an anticlimactic finale), natalie portman's unhinged performance verges on unsympathetic and grating, and i wasn't sure what to make of the film's quasi-critical, slightly half-assed take on pop music and the commodification of tragedy. i was never bored, but i was never fully invested either.
If you managed to stop this movie right before the Act II title card, this would be one of the absolute best films of the year. Corbet crafts an outstanding thesis from a very good question: are we turning our victims into superstars? It explores some really remarkable ideas about celebrity and tragedy in a creative, exciting way. An hour into this, and I was ready to call Brady Corbet our next great filmmaker. And then they jumped forward in time and these themes just kinda... stopped? Suddenly, we have an interesting, yet meandering character study on Celeste at 31, now a mom and a full fledged superstar. Natalie Portman absolutely SLAYS in this role, but for what? Between Act II and Finale, Vox Lux becomes a fine enough film, albeit one that squanders its initial promise. The absolute biggest ball drop here is the lack of payoff involving the terrorism subplot. Celeste becomes a popstar based on a song she wrote after a school shooting she survived. She becomes a transgressive Gaga/Madonna figure, and then a group of terrorists shoot up a beach seventeen years later... dressed as characters from a Celeste video. But that’s merely a detail used as a way to get Celeste to say controversial things to the press and it never pays off. It’s not fair to judge a film for what it’s not, but when a film so strongly builds itself up to be something it ends up not being, it’s hard not to feel short changed. The entire Finale, regardless of the strange shift in message, is breathtaking. It’s Natalie Portman actually becoming a convincing popstar on screen, stage presence, lights show, pyrotechnics... electrifying. If only Vox Lux were as tightly put together as Celeste’s stage show.
everytime i watch this is gets better, natalie and raffey nailed it. WHY is this not getting any attention for awards, they were robbed truly
ambitious but feels unfinished. i feel for celeste though (awful dancing and emotional trauma).
Does Vox Lux eventually crack under the weight of its own ambition? Absolutely. Did that climax need to go on for as long as it did? Not really. But holy shit this thing was just ballsy enough to win me over. I knew as soon as it finished that I wanted to see it again. It also has one of my favorite musical scores of the year.
Even though I’m in love with Natalie Portman, I set that aside whenever I watch anything she’s in so I can give it a fair review. I just love all her stuff by coincidence.  This is so daring, complex, shocking, rough, divisive, and beautiful all at the same time. I knew I was in for something different going in, but still had no idea what to expect. Truly harsh critique of pop/celebrity culture. I’d rank Portman’s performance up there with her roles in Black Swan and Jackie. You don’t like her at all, but somehow you still sympathize with her.
How anyone liked this is beyond me. In the opening minutes, director and writer Brady Corbet uses a school shooting as a jumping off point for a film that honestly has nothing to do with domestic terrorism or violence. In the painful process of trying to create an interesting character, Corbet trivializes modern mass shootings and horrid violence, specifically against children, leading to one of the most embarrassing and self-indulgent films I've seen all year. If Corbet is trying to say something, that something is not present in this film. Is this film about terrorism? Not really. Is this film about mass shootings? I think it wants to be, but it's not. Is this film about being a celebrity? I guess, but it concerns itself a little too much with terrorism for me to feel like that's the whole point. Is this film about the link between tragedy and stardom? Maybe? Is this film somehow trying to purport some sort of thesis that connects pop music to terrorism? I sure hope not, because that's fucking stupid and offensive. Is this movie a critique of pop music, and is trying to use terrorism as a means of saying that pop music shouldn't be taken seriously? What the fuck is this movie trying to say? Also, nothing happens in this movie. I'll rewrite the script for you, right here. Celeste survives a school shooting, she writes a song about it and becomes a pop star. Fifteen years later, she performs on stage. The end. All of the scenes in this movie do nothing. They don't inform character, the dialogue is pointless and makes the characters unbearable, and the music is bad. This movie throws out a bunch of concepts and does nothing with them, and if you're going to try to make school shootings a key concept of your film, you better portray it in a way that's respectful and not confusing and misguided. What the fuck is this movie? And it's so self-important and up it's own ass. I was on the edge of my seat in the last thirty minutes because I was so excited to stand up and leave the theater as soon as I saw the first credit roll. The only redeeming factor of this movie is some cool cinematography. The performances are good, but the characters are truly awful. This movie has nothing to say, but it wants you to think it has everything to say. Truly insufferable. 2018 Ranked
A film that starts with a bang and ends in a fizzle, 'Vox Lux' impresses before it disappoints. Featuring a brilliant set of twin performances from Raffey Cassidy, along with a collection of mannered tics masquerading as performances from Natalie Portman and Jude Law, the film offers cinematic highs and lows in an uneven, uneasy mix. Brady Corbet is sure of neither story nor theme, delivering occasionally powerful set pieces that fail to come together in a meaningful whole. Corbet juggles multiple narrative balls here, some with great skill, but cannot quite create a meaningful pattern in the trajectories of each, nor in their crossing. The expository voiceover by Willem Dafoe doesn't help, layering the plot with portent undone by the purple prose. The vapid sounds of Celeste's music also ring false - for an artist ostensibly motivated by trauma, she traffics in surprisingly unmemorable bubblegum beats. Still, there are moments where Corbet and his troupe – especially Cassidy – shine, sometimes making us forget the distressing pointlessness of the entire affair. But then we return to the music and our disappointment, and wonder, what was the point of the shocking opener if it all just ends in stale pop tunes By the end, Corbet’s hyper-stylized 'Vox Lux' proves to be purely a concert for one, a thematically hollow mix of grad school philosophizing and exploding glitter.
Damn that was intense!!!! Can’t tell if the songs are good, purposefully bad, or bad. Oh well.  The Hologram music video seemed lit as shit.  Most importantly : this year, concerts were shot so superbly in movies. So good.  Most importantly : the acting was amazing Raffey Cassidy and Natalie Portman are God’s There was a q&a w the director and Portman afterwards and that was sick
One of the more underrated films of the year. I'm pretty sure it was Executive Produced by Jackson Maine.
Prologue: Stupid Choice Act 1: Bad Act 2: Interesting I never became interested in the screenplay, the choices Brady made with his camera are enticing. I'm willing to look at what he offers in the future, but as a screenwriter I'm not sold. The actors being reused at the same ages, over reliance on subtext, narration, and supernatural hints really kept me from me from getting into it. I wouldn't say it sucks empirically, but as a single viewer this unfortunately sucked to watch. Of note: had 3 walkouts.
Natalie Portman said FUCK the NRA.
first want to preface this, it’s not for everyone. Brady Corbet’s profile of desensitization and dismissiveness is flashy, uncomfortable, and insane but ultimately it’s one of the most visceral experiences I’ve had in a theater.
I loved this movie and don't ask me why.
I don’t know if this was good it’s stressing me out but what I can tell you is Natalie Portman is a goddamn thespiAN
Saw the q&a this time. Natalie was THERE. Brady CORBET was thERE. They answered it of the questions I had about the film including the music... the process of WRITING the music and setting. I think it was better this time and even faster than last time. Although I do not think it’s the best movie of this year, I thinks VERY rewatchable and super fun to talk about. Not done. The subtitle “a 21 century portrait” is so accurate now that I have thought more about the film. I can see myself seeing it again in the near future, which I can’t say about many films. Other than Lady Bird.
gave me a panic attack !
Kinda mixed on this as a whole, but decidedly un-mixed on the opinion that the concert sequence is absolutely haunting and it should win like 10 Oscars on its own.
Fascinating examination of modern society through the lens of celebrity, mass media, and terrorism. The deadpan narration from Willem Dafoe lends the commentary a chilly detachment. Also, this film is a lot more honest about its disdain for pop music than A Star is Born. That, plus being more wildly ambitious in reaching for the zeitgeist and passing the Bechdel-Wallace test make Brady Corbet’s Vox Lux the superior work. Deadass.
So Vox Lux..... there was some stuff I liked but, the rest was not good. I enjoyed the parts with younger Celeste more then the Natalie Portman stuff to be honest.
I first saw this at the Chicago International Film Festival back in October and I really liked it. I didn't quite love it, but I've been thinking about it since I saw it, and after a second viewing, I can confidently say this: Vox Lux? More like Vox Fux. I love this damn movie. It's harrowing, hilarious, gleefully up its own ass, and cynical as hell while somehow managing to feel emotionally true. The Willem Dafoe narration is great too, framing the movie like a Behind the Music episode and adding to the self-awareness. There's a sharp balance between retrospection and immediacy that feels makes it operate in an uncanny grey area between the glitzy Eurotrash of latter-day Nicolas Winding Refn and—prepare for a blasphemous comparison here—some of the themes and progression of Bob Fosse and John Cassavetes. I'm not saying it's refined as the latter two, of course, because this movie is kind of a glorious mess. And that's kind of the point. Defining the 21st century by endless tragedies and the hit-or-miss art we use to numb the pain is a pretty bitter viewpoint, but Corbet makes it work. The trauma, the glassy-eyed pity, the way we thrash around to evade our pasts—it sings volumes. Oh, and I wasn't sure about it on my first viewing, but that pointedly generic choreography towards the end is a riot. Original capsule review here.
Liked parts but I personally could care less about the life of a pop star.
This shit was fuckin nuts. I kinda loved it. I’m really pissed no one is talking about this movie. Natalie Portman is phenomenal. As are Jude Law and Raffey Cassidy. The music is awesome and so are the costumes/makeup as well. People need to see this film
Entirely up it's own ass, pitched (both performance wise and tonally) completely wrong, has no clue what (if any) point it actually wants to make, and yet there is some fun to be had in its guileless pretense. This is a film that will ominously zoom in on the New World Trade Center as horns blare to remind the audience that POP MUSIC and TERRORISM are all part of the cynical and gross American culture. The audacity and clumsiness of stuff like this are kind of fun to chuckle at as Corbett makes a rather entry level Social Studies class commentary about the music industry. But credit where credit is due. It looks amazing, the score by Scott Walker and original songs by Sia are fantastic, and Willem Dafoe makes a great narrator. Kind of an insult Jonathan Demme though.
so ..... uhhh the end of the movie  was underwhelming but the first act and second act saved me from hating it
yes i saw this in theaters three times in a single week... AND!!!!!!! the q&a was amazing and really answered questions i had about the film, and natalie portman is so beautiful and intelligent :,))))
One of my most anticipated films of the year, and one of the biggest disappointments. Natalie Portman and Raffey Cassidy gave great performances, but the editing (to many montages), and the narration (why?), ruined it for me.
Well, that was disappointing! The entertainment industry being used to exploit tragedies isn't exactly a novel concept, yet Corbet and co. treat it such. In this film, the worst tendencies of filmmakers like Winding Refn and others are on display, and Natalie Portman gives us her best Nicholas Cage impression. The best scene in the film takes place within the first 10 minutes, and it's all downhill from there.
God damn, there's a lot to unpack. Just go see it.
Bowling For Columbine 2: A Star Is Born
I don't know what I was talking about in my first review, this film is perfect. It's shocking and confusing and subverts all expectations in the greatest ways. A second viewing is absolutely required for Vox Lux.
Did Celeste receive counseling at any point? She may want to consider it. A hot mess of a movie. Some of it I loved (the music, the cinematography, Raffey Cassidy), some of it I really disliked (the narrative didn’t totally gel for me, Natalie Portman...sorry guys). But it’s definitely the kind of bold filmmaking I appreciate and an excellent conversation piece. And ABBA makes a brief appearance in a montage so there’s that.
the other girlies WISH they could pull off a perfect critique of 21st century culture and the nuances of modern pop music
It wasn’t until about halfway through this movie that I realized how weird of a guy I am. There I am sat by myself in an empty regal theater in my bullshit liberal arts college town. Anyway, I loved this movie. Without saying too much, Corbet’s sophomore feature is just as enigmatic and fascinating as his debut. I will say though this is much better than Childhood of a Leader. It’s so well shot, acted, scored and definitely very well directed. The tone Corbet creates in this movie is just so unique and hypnotic. Aspects remind me of Gaspar Noe’s, I Stand Alone and of course Haneke’s stark style of filmmaking makes an appearance.  I love this film buts its really hard to talk about after seeing it just once, especially since I’m dancing around tons of aspects that I valued seeing so much without knowing what was coming. Hopefully, I’ll see it again in the next couple days but I just look forward to experiencing this film again.
brady corbet wants to be hanake so bad and y'know what? i fuck with that. maybe one day he will be. but for now we've got this, and i mean, it tries. songs are dope af tho.
????? i don’t even know what to say?????? this was so crazy from start to finish. if you’re planning on watching this, don’t read any reviews or articles about it!! act 1 was so dark and unexpected, some ppl walked out after the first 10 minutes (understandably). this reminds me of assassination nation (kind of) where the shock factor is what makes this movie so good to me. i think if i were to watch this more than twice i would not enjoy it very much. i feel like the ending was too abrupt, but also it fits so well with the entire movie. also...the feeling her performance in act 3 gave me...thank you so much i’m now a #Celestenator. hi miss natalie portman you were so good in this!!!!!!   It doesn’t matter if you’re Michelangelo or Mikey and Angelo from New Brunswick
This movie knocked my socks off. I don't know how else to say it. I was expecting a sort of high-camp take down of fading pop stardom, and that certainly is embedded in this season of socially-induced trauma masqued in a narcissistic haze of unbridled emotion, but there is so much more to unpack.   The unexpected first act immediately set me off balance in a way I found at first exploitative, before, much later, realizing the true genius behind such a set up. However, long before all that, I was calmed by the dulcet tones of our narator, Willem DeFoe, playing as much the self rationalizing voice inside our star's head as he is the omniscient narrator he initially appears to be. Therein lies what's transcendent about this cinematic experience.   Everything about this film comes out you loud and fast and in your face. It's big in everyway it can be. Most of the time you think you see exactly what Corbat and Portman are up too and you are pretty sure you've seen it before, better with more nuance and complexity. However, just then a piece will click into place and you'll realize there actually was more there under the hood than you were giving them credit for, and, even when there isn't, you just have to applaud everyone's commitment to go for it as hard as they do.   PS Have I told you I'm a sucker for character studies of oversized narcissists? This might explain a few things.
a star is stillborn
They should have gotten Robyn to write the music!!!
Stunning,the choices made in this even from the silent end credits made me speechless.In my top 3 for the year.
Maybe it was ahead of its time
38 A twentieth century portrait.  In dedication to Jonathan Demme.  Demme wouldn’t dare put his name on this ostentatious trash. There’s nothing worth than an overwrought art film, let alone one as unoriginal and slapdashed as this one.  La Dolce Vita this is not.
This is an incredibly artistic and impressive film. At times stark and jarring... well not even at times, there’s a lot of stark and jarring, but the absurd honesty it has in itself is so appealing that I couldn’t really bring my self to dislike any of it too a certain degree. I do personally still prefer A Star Is Born, but I think they are very different movies with very different things to say. I’m somewhat dancing around the deeper discussion topics because I want people to see it for themselves. Portman is incredible, as always. Like seriously, was there any doubt. Raffey Cassidy was fuckin wonderful! And holy shit Jude Law! Jude law juuling! Jude Law acting! He was great!!
I don’t think this film fully accomplished what it set out to do.  That being said, Natalie Portman is everything.
Yo dude someone get Brady Corbet on the line, tell that woke king his movies are too good!! Also ask him if he’s ever been to a concert because I’m not so sure  🅱️OX 🅱️UX BEST PICTURE 2019
Vox Lux is so strange and risky that I can’t help but applaud it. The multiple odd choices makes this stand out as one of the most interestingly set-up films I’ve seen lately. It’s presented as a chronicle of a pop star’s career and, you totally get that, but it does so much more. Surprisingly narrated by the venerable Willem Dafoe, we are jolted into the world that is being presented. Quite literally. I nearly lost my seat. Raffey Cassidy captures us with innosense and a naive sense of who Celeste is.  After making our way through such unique and interesting time lapses, we are once again pulled into another chapter in her life. This works in a similar way to the first half, but loses the innocence and trades it in for raw vulnerability.  Natalie Portman does what every actor desperately strives for: transformation. While I can’t commend her singing voice, it truly doesn’t matter. It’s not about the music. For Celeste, it isn’t about the music. It’s about the fans. More specifically, how the fans make her feels. This film is about Celeste and no one else. Of course there are some wonderful performances by Jude Law, Stacy Martin, and Jennifer Ehle. However, we all came to see what Natalie and Raffey give to create the role of Celeste. Vox Lux doesn’t care what you think. Vox Lux is here to put on a show. How many of you have cried yourself to sleep at night?
Our cultural institutions feed on the moral rot beating at the heart of everything, smearing voided blood across their face. We are humanity’s afterbirth. As the earth catches fire and its oceans drown us, we will suffocate while sublimating every horrorible truth in service of our decadence. In one billion years, the universe will have forgotten us—our smallness, our conceited ambition—and once again be still.
Bradley Cooper and Lady Gaga? Not this time. Natalie Portman? Always.
UM THIS IS A LOT.
THERE ARE NO WORDS
Independent cinema’s take on a Star is Born, but so so so much more. A movie hasn’t left me this excited in a while ✨  update: it’s 1:02am and I’m still processing the opening scene of this film. I don’t think the adrenaline has warn off yet. 😯💭
baby avec cash this film transcends review
This film is so bizarre, but I’m so on board with it.
I'm not sure if I loved it or hated it...
Completely not what I was expecting it to be. I did not expect the origin angle they took with Portman's character but I thought it was amazing and incredibly powerful. This movie is just directed to greatness, especially the final concert scene.
idk....i loved it???? it was dark and twisted and desperate and weird and completely out of left field and raffey cassidy is a POWERHOUSE
So.... was the music supposed to be bad?
Natalie Portman is amazing as this character, but Raffey Cassidy in dual roles as the young version and her daughter really brought it all together.
The chaos hurts. So we try to drown it out, to speak up, to communicate some kind of meaning, to scream against the dark, to shout until it doesn’t hurt anymore - but the chaos is still there, and now it’s just noisier. Vox Lux combines modern American pain and modern American hope into one big unwieldy package, crafting a gorgeous film that might be just as brilliant as it is messy. Still not entirely sure what the film’s trying to say underneath all the shock and flash, and it’s definitely pretentious, but who cares when it feels this good. Or, rather, makes me feel this bad.
Intoxicating. I have next to no interest in the material, but the fairly straightforward story is complimented (enriched, even) by Corbet's unconventional formal approach that immediately disarmed me and left me stunned throughout. It's complex, bold, moving, and haunting. I'll likely get more detailed after a rewatch.
I feel like I loved it but also would never care to see it again?
No one told me the back half of this was basically a Kanye circa 2010 biopic. So of course I loved it (and I'm sorry about that). Not sure I'm totally sold on Portman's performance in this (which is surprising, because I almost always love her even when I don't love the movie)... but everything else? It worked for me, I don't know what to tell you.
Vox Lux from director Brady Corbet is one of the years best and most beautiful films. A cynical look at modern pop culture. It sucks, it’s not unique at all and only exists to serve the brainless masses. Celeste (played by Natalie Portman who is hamming it up) during her lunch even talks about how her music videos are bad. 21st century pop culture is nothing more than a temporary escape from the horrors of the real world and Celeste’s music (which is indistinguishable from one another pop songs) is the gateway. On top of this there are a lot of moving pieces with this film. So many that it should not work but somehow does. I could talk for hours about how tragedy creates stars, the relationship between stars, their relationship with their own children and many other things. Corbet’s style of film-making is perfect for this story. Lot’s of visual storytelling going on for those that can read into it. Intentionally artsy and bound to be hated by the masses. Not much more to say. I would recommend watching Vox Lux with as little information going in as possible. It’s funny, dark and a good look at our world all wrapped up in one of the years most mesmerizing movies. The fact that this is playing on the smallest screen at my theater while Immortal Engines and the 100th Spider-Man movie are both on 10+ screens says it all.
celeste is in the illuminati
Stunning, but disappointingly empty. (a parallel to general pop music?) This is the portrait of a pop icon on the level of Lady Gaga, Katie Perry, Rihanna, etc, but whose inspiration and comeuppance blossomed out of violent tragedy similar to the real-life event of the Columbine shooting. I should start by saying that I liked it, especially everything visual. There were some pretty ballsy creative decisions made here, not the least of which was to roll the damn credits ten minutes into the film over a great driving montage. "Critics are raving" about Natalie Portman + Jude Law (who are both precious and did great), but anyone who saw this knows that Raffey Cassidy is the real star here.  [sorta spoilers ahead]  The thing is, the intended climax was so empty/unsatisfying that when it was over I almost laughed. There's a very serious revelation given by the narrator right near the end that was so interesting to me, and I thought: "Yes! It's gonna pull a last-minute 'Black Swan' and slap me sideways!" It did not. The most compelling parts of this movie are watching Celeste deal with the aftermath of the shooting and begin the road to stardom, and I think opportunity was lost in the jump from 2001 to 2017. And the fact that the second shooting of the film had no lasting impact or connection to the main story is such a WASTE. Did the writers not know what they truly wanted to say with this piece? Was the vision so unclear?
Natalie Portman is unsurprisingly out-acted by the actress playing her younger self and her daughter (don't ask.) The decision to age only one character over a period of 18 years was curious at best, and distracting at worst, but still not as bad as the pretentious voice-over narration or the grating pop music at the center of it all.
Y’all. I’m losing my entire GAY MIND!!!! Talented, brilliant, incredible, amazing, show-stopping, spectacular, etc.... it’s not a cautionary tale about the art of celebrity as much as it is a modern retelling of Faust (which is made pretty clear at the end). It’s not a story about the loss of innocence as much as it is a story about not growing up. And it’s not a catchy pop song as much as it is a night at the opera. It attempts to be an amalgamation of pop culture in the 21st century told on a biblical scale and for the most part, it succeeds.  I totally get why people aren’t liking this; it’s cold, it’s uncompromising, there’s not a single sympathetic character.... and the biggest complaint seems to be the jarring shift between the first act and the second, but if you’re asking me, all of it works. The intimate and quiet nature of the first act is replaced with chaos in both visuals and dialogue to really convey where this character is now and what she’s become, and Raffey Cassidy completely sells both acts alone. Sorry to be a bitch.... but this really is everything A Star Is Born wishes it was.... many will deny it but it’s the truth!
Them gyrations
The choreography is awful and the last songs are awful but it makes sense. Everyone’s performance is AMAZING but Natalie Portman is the highlight of the movie.
The creation and life of a pop star as 21st Century America, with figurative (and possibly literal?) apocalypses bobbing around the margins. Horrifying and darkly funny. Features competing scores, one by Sia and one by Scott Walker. Okay!
VOX LUX is an interesting, if not incredibly flawed breakdown of the degradation that occurs on the road to pop-stardom. We see a young, idealistic woman who uses music to shape her perception of tragedy become a rambling, Madonna-esque conspiracy theory idiot over the course of the film’s 90-minute runtime. Unfortunately, we only get to see this as a juxtaposition, as a jarring 16-year jump that comes an hour into the film skips over the transformation process that, frankly, may have been more interesting to watch than what actually makes it on-screen. Additionally, a consistent VO pervades the film, filling in backstory and betraying any sense of subtlety that may have come with it. Nevertheless, this film does quite a bit well. The gun violence at the center of the film is incredibly timely and sobering, while Corbet accomplishes his goal of f showing the shallow nature of pop via his protagonist’s flippant, insincere attitude toward real-world problems that would have previously engaged her. Her complete disconnection with reality is one of the more fascinating aspects of the film. Additionally, Raffey Cassidy is excellent playing dual roles in the film as young Celeste and, later, Celeste’s teenage daughter. She absolutely knocks her role out of the park and, in many moments, actually upstages Portman. Part of the issue with Portman’s performance is her actual on-stage singing and dancing work left quite a bit to be desired. I’m not sure if it’s on her or the choreography team, but it actually takes the viewer out of the film a bit, since it’s difficult to buy this person as a pop icon. Perhaps that’s the point? Maybe Corbet is attempting to make a point about the diminishing musical abilities of pop talents as their stature grows? If so, the point almost feel tangential. Overall, VOX LUX was quite watchable, but it doesn’t contain nearly as much satirical bite as it thinks it does.
that ending sequence is the best movie moment of the year. also an infinitely better popstar movie than a star is born FIGHT ME
A nasty tantrum of a film, rife with tragedy. Beneath all of its extravagance it makes a statement that's deeply troubling and timely, so much more disturbing than I'd anticipated.
This is felt like a Natalie Portman appreciation movie.
This is definitely not for everyone, but I actually liked it a lot. Sure the relation between gun violence and pop superstardom explored here won't sit well with a lot of people, but I got what the director Brady Corbet was going for even though the relation is not completely fleshed out. Brady's direction is sharp and the visuals were great, even though this movie has problems I see great things from this director. The songs in the movie are okay, only Wrapped Up, Alive, and EKG are worth listening to really. SIA really should've wrote stronger songs because other than those three the songs in this movie were not it. The performances from Natalie Portman, Raffey Cassidy, and Jude Law are great. This is one of Natalie's best performances I've seen from her, though not the best as that's reserved for Black Swan and followed up by Jackie. Natalie was really serving some serious Black Swan vibes, particularly when she was at her show and the red light was hitting her. Natalie really did more choreography during her concert than most of the new pop girls do today. The fact that Celeste really resembled in some aspects the shooter at the start of the movie at the end is a bold statement to make. To say that Celeste herself has turned into a monster by the end has some merit, but to say she and the shooter are the same is crazy. The fact that I did not get to see Natalie Portman sing Wrapped Up fully in this movie is a sin, although the movie did close out with EKG so I can't be that mad because that song is a bop and is a nice song to end the movie on.
"I think I need some new stuff to counteract the old stuff." There's not a lot of new stuff here, but the old stuff works well enough that it doesn't need much counteraction. Yes, teenage girls who get a taste of fame can be recklessly impulsive. Ditto teen stars who grow into young adulthood in the glare of the spotlight. What writer/director Barry Corbet (an actor himself) cannily does is skip over the 16 years in between the filming of Celeste's "Hologram" video (on the same day as the 9/11 attacks) and a copycat terrorist shooting on a Croatian beach that happens to coincide with the kickoff of her comeback concert tour and let the audience catch up and fill in the blanks as best they can.
Jesus fucking christ. So ambitious, absolutely unhinged, and frightening as all hell.  First half is a bit tighter than the second (Raffey Cassidy KILLS it) but overall fantastic filmmaking and Natalie Portman’s terrifying, unconventional performance saves the second half from sagging too much. The ideas are haunting and fascinating, and it’s smart to offer more questions than answers- no one has any sensible answers for the tragedies we live through day in and out.  It doesn’t completely stick the landing but damn does it stun in its execution. We need more films that are willing to try something this bold.
Vox Lux offers some insightful messages about using pop music as a method of healing from tragedy. But overall, it's overzealous and tries too hard to leave a lasting impact. Read why here (Full review): popculturereviews.com/2018/12/14/vox-lux-review/?fbclid=IwAR2bqtE44xD26syO43l_PUQTSQPcu9OxcwjwmoMQzjzPL1NdSry5cRp6usc
I settled in to a theater with one other person as the light dimmed to what would be one of the strangest, disturbing, and odd-beat films of the year. The darker side of fame and appeal that is relatively unexplored in A Star is Born is what gives this its defining qualities. The sickening, ultraviolent, depiction of pop-stardom separates itself from the musical genres in a macabre fashion. Brady Corbet’s film works to establish pop-culture and its existence in a world of violence, questioning the connection, if there is any. Right from the visceral and gritty opening prelude, one knows that Corbet is trying to work on establishing Celeste’s mentality especially in the wake of tragedy, but works to almost show how culture is working to cover up and shed new light on something that spawns out of it, rather than allowing grieving. It truly is a film about maturity, tragedy, coping, and innocence, but Corbet wants to show you how one’s mentality works when not given the chance to learn how to deal with these topics, and the effects it has.  Sia’s handprint is everywhere in the film, and I’m quite fine with that. Her records are some of the best pop coming from our FM and internet radios, and her way with lyrics is nearly poetic. These songs feel hastily written, but effective nonetheless as that is what the film tackles with. Pop music is not supposed to make you think, but to make you feel really good. That’s what Celeste tells the audience in a situation of statuatory boundaries, but the lyrics within the film really work to solidify that idea, which is why the soundtrack is really only worth listening to after the film. Portman’s singing is fine, but Raffey Cassidy’s tracks are more fleshed out, signify the change in standards that Celeste’s career has had to adjust to.  Keeping with the discussion of the music, Scott Waller’s score is effective, bare, and but forgettable by the time we get it the stellar performances throughout the film. It works to provide a state of unease in the film when it needs to, and allows scenes to not fall to awkward silence. The non-diegetic music is simply just that though, meant to exist outside the story for the sake of it being there. Shooting on film works to the advantage of Corbet, as the drab, washed out images really make the performance at the end of the film feel fake, and strange in comparison to the end of the film. The bright colors are clearly not Celeste as a human being but as a persona, and it is a smart nuance with regards to cinematography.  This is not completely Portman’s show (and I’ll admit, she is probably the only reason I saw this movie), as Raffey Cassidy really holds her own, keeping the same dry delivery and performance that she exhibited in Lanthimos’ The Killing of a Sacred Deer. Stacy Martin is great in her smaller role, and the narration by Willem Dafoe was worth noting as well. As much as I think Portman could grab a nomination come Oscar season, I doubt it will happen. One can dream though.  The films major fault comes in its editing and story telling. While the themes introduced within the first third are expanded upon in a stellar fashion, the second half slows the tracks, showing a day of Celeste’s life with no regards to what was set up before. It flips its story on its head in the second and third act, almost jarringly, with no intention of really expanding on what was set up before. It works to it advantage as it is able to both compare and contrast Celeste from the beginning to the end, but it comes at a cost of the story, and the pacing. What was a mildly paced thriller on fame and innocence slows to a strange drama on the acceptance and attitude that fame presents on the psyche of the character. It is almost sloppy, but has the benefit of the film being a character portrait rather than a full story about the fame itself.  This will continue to be divisive and ultimately will fall out of the small public conscious it has formed now with the next month or so, but I really think that this film succeeds by mixing visceral and graphic violence, innocence, over sexuality, and how the pop music scene affects culture, even in the face of tragedy. Psychologically, it is gripping to see Celeste grow and change, but it comes at a cost. I highly recommend this, as its gritty take on the story that A Star is Born has continued to tell is both refreshing and outside of the box. Possibly one of my favorites of the year.
Watching Natalie Portman dance on stage in glittery outfits and sing pop music is what initially caught my interested. Thankfully, there is a bit more depth and darkness to Natalie Portman's characters rise to stardom. The dream-like presentation and ethereal atmosphere assist in capturing the viewer full attention during the entire course of the movie. From the opening scene until the ending, the experience of watching the main character exist in their broken state is quite entertaining.
Suggested tag line : A (slightly pretentious and moderately successful) 21st Century Portrait (with potential and a glittery Natalie Portman).
wrapped up was the only good song but go off i guess
Natalie Portman is the baddest bitch in the room.
i mean this in the best way possible... natalie portman gives a tom-hardy-as-venom-esque performance
It’s only not my worst of the year because I’m a sucker for creative credits. Got super close to walking out of the theater when Natalie Portman’s character started pouring out all this “we live in a society” garbage dialog at her daughter in that god-awful accent. This film is perfect for people whose favorite movie is Enter the Void. I’ll raise it half a star if the point of this film was that I was supposed to hate every second of it.
The opening sequence was really, really good. Every sequence thereafter? Really, really not good. Look, Natalie Portman does a good job, and Raffey Cassidy does an even better job with the material. And yeah, some of the Sia-penned songs are kinda fun. But as a finished product, I found many of the scenes to be tedious and aimless.
I was the only person in my theater’s screening of Vox Lux, making the experience all the more intimate. I’m still not entirely sure how I feel about this film, but there are moments in this that left me utterly spellbound. Brady Corbet’s direction felt incredibly nuanced, and I enjoyed the way he framed his shots and unconventional structure to the film. Natalie Portman was, unsurprisingly, magical. Someone who truly surprised me though was Raffey Cassidy. She’s such a force to be reckoned with here and her ability to command a scene, both as Celeste and Albertine, is insane. I am so excited to continue to follow her career as an actress. Where the film falls a bit flat for me is in its second act, however. The shift in tone feels abrupt and took me a while to get used to. Additionally, the ending didn’t hit as hard as I was expecting it to. Nevertheless, this film showcases some of my favorite performances of the year and despite its overall messiness contains several moments of brilliance that will continue to haunt me for days to come. Corbet's approach to the subject matter was genuinely enthralling and although I may never understand the statement he's attempting to make with this "21st Century Portrait", it sure was one hell of a ride. I look forward to revisiting this at some point and seeing if/how my feelings change.
Jesus Christ. I should hate this movie. It's cruel, uncaring, and barely has a third act. However, the filmmaking in this is utterly hypnotic. A 112 minute pop-infused nightmare sent directly from Hell that blew me away. Neon is absolutely insane for giving this a wide release and I'm so glad they did. (Side note: Celeste's music literally sounds like she could be a PC Music artist)
Rating: B+ The filmmaking is bruting. The music is fresh. Natalie Portman is a gift from God. She truly is the best actress in the world right now. This completes the trifecta for her portrait pieces with “Black Swan”, “Jackie”, and now “Vox Lux”. She is a powerhouse. And that finale. Woo!
Part social commentary, part satire, but fairly inconclusive - director Brady Colbert's latest trek into obscure territory entitled “Vox Lux” raises questions about fame and notoriety in one of the strangest films of the year.   Split into chapters, with a dry narration from Willem Dafoe - “Vox Lux” charts one popstars insane journey into stardom starting in 1999 and ending in 2017.  Full review at TheOnlyCritic.com
YEAH LOL THIS WAS PERFECT NO 🧢  Probably Natalie’s best performance yet, not sure yet though. This film is much more than just a story about a pop star. It’s a film about a mother, sister, and survivor. The writing really conveys the emotional aspects of these characters and it had me so involved. Brady Corbet really solidifies himself as a real director with this one and I can’t wait to see what else he does in the future. I’m really shocked this isn’t getting more praise than it is. The movie has such a unique directing style that I love so much, the title cards, the narration by Willem Dafoe, etc. it all payed off for me. I can see how some people may be let down by the third act, the movie kinda just ends unexpectedly which may bother some, but I left very satisfied. This was probably my most anticipated film of the year once I saw the trailer and met and even exceeded my expectations. I’ll probably get around to see this one more time before it leaves theaters.
There are two tragedies in life.        One is to lose your heart's desire.   The other is to gain it.  Still a great movie that is doing a lot with a lot and I am captivated by almost every minute.
the sound editing was bad for like 50% of this otherwise pretty movie. i wanna throw mad props to my main man lol crowley. nick kroll and john mulaney never should have mocked you at the spirit awards last year
Vox Lux was an experience I wasn't prepared for. It was an interesting take on stardom in the current cuotural climate that in my opinion A Star Is Born (2018) completely missed in it's second half. However, this film was missing the heart and anything that could be considered a satisfying end. The two films I would argue are best seen together, Vox Lux then A Star is Born (2018.) If there is one thing I can say about Vic Lux, it's that I'm still here thinking about it the next day.
A lot of people are gonna hate this, but they’re wrong. It gave me the same sorts of feelings as watching First Reformed. It may feel “pretentious” but it’s a lot smarter than that gives it credit for.  Also might have the best opening credits sequence ever?
‘People have been bringing me down for yearrrrs’  The real Star was born. Vox Lux is not what you think. I’m going to say right now that Natalie Portman was already snubbed of best supporting actress. I have not seen a performance so passionate In YEARS. Every single frame that she is in, you’re feeling at least 3 different kinds of emotions at once. It is nearly impossible to describe this film. The main things that come to mind are masterful, crude, devastating, and psychedelic. Go and support this IMMEDIATELY.
Haha, this really thinks it's something. Not sure if serious? Mostly had a blast, though.
Natalie did the MOST and I loved it.  This movie was ridiculous and I loved it?
one of the few movies I’ve seen this year that truly radiate a single filmmaker’s vision and passion. I feel like the opening is shocking for the sake of being shocking but after that’s its pretty smooth sailing. Really makes you think; I might even need to see it again, but I’m not sure I can stomach a rewatch.
The worst. Tries to tie real world tragedies to pop music and Portman is trying way too hard. Hated this. Almost walked out. Double feature with the far superior Spider-Man: Into the spider verse.
People will hate this because it shoots for something great but manages to only flirt with success. Above all, the precision and form inspire, and I'm thrilled to see where this new voice of cinema takes us. Also...Natalie Portman is a national treasure, how and why is she so good?
hi can someone please tell me why they liked this because i just...i dont get the hype. natalie portman was incredible in it but like...thats it
natalie portman with the best female performance of the year. i said what i said
Loved this film would be five stars except the last 10 mins of Natalie Portman’s awkward dancing took it down half a star.  But this is a super cool film about terror and celebrity.  Go see this instead of ASIB.
this film has everything, but very rarely does it actually come up with something. I’m so disappointed with the plot line- what was the point? however, the visuals were absolutely stunning and created a experience almost liminal. it just needs a bit of re-editing and it could be perfection
Stars aren’t born in "Vox Lux." They’re baptized in hellfire and draped in silver sequins. Their turbulent personal demons, rebranded as their innate charm, are meant to draw 30,000 to an arena just to see a spectacle unfold. If only there were a show. READ FULL REVIEW ON AZCENTRAL.COM
I literally have no idea how to rate something like this. The AV Club used to have a rating that was "A/F" for content that was perfectly challenging and genre redefining but getting there in ridiculous and sometimes off-putting ways. This feels like that. The opening "Prelude" is vile. If you wanted to walk out of the theater during this sequence, it would be 100% understandable. On the other side of that coin, if the filmmakers want to make the case that shooting that sequence with such realism and putting you in the crosshairs of a school shooting is necessary - in order for you to take the traumatic journey with this character - sure. They can make that case. "Act I" is just fine. "Act II" and "Act III" are phenomenal. Portman only enters the film halfway through but she steals the entire thing. Why do other actors try? Portman is the most transformative actress in history. I have said this before with Jackie, but she’s an icon. "Finale" for me was the worst bit here. It's necessary in context but I guess it was too drawn out for me.
Just an awful awful awful, deeply mean, cynical film. There's next to nothing to write home about here. The score is exceptional, respect to Scott Walker. Jude Law is very cool and hits a Juul at one point. The film also has a predictably progressive perspective on pop music. That's really it. Everything else is shallow, if not outright embarrassing. Brady Corbet is a film boy who has been patted on the shoulder one too many times, and as a result, feels he has carte blanche to make insensitive, exploitative, and mean-spirited films. His entire career is the result of one too many childhood trips to Europe, where he probably feels "more at home at" or something. I am not a fan of him. I am also incredibly saddened to report that this is easily (re: EASILY) Natalie Portman's worst performance; this is coming from someone who still thinks she should have won for 2016's JACKIE and has been criminally miscast for most of her career. Here, she adopts a shrill and inconsistent Long Island accent while she waxes poetic about phoniness and her failures as a mother. Whatever. I went into this anticipating a trashy pop film, but here I am at 2:30 AM pissed off that this movie was dumb and bad and not fun.
"What the hell do you think that was about?" - One of the three other people at my showing of Vox Lux Wow. All I can say is wow. This film completely floored me. I was expecting A Star is Born, but we got something completely different. Both focus on the life of a pop star, but Vox Lux goes in a completely different direction, one that I wasn't expecting, and one that makes it so much more memorable. Natalie Portman is one of my favorite actresses. I've only seen a few films from her, but from the ones I have seen, she has blown me away every single time. This is no different with Vox Lux, with Celeste being a character unlike anything that I have seen her in before. She may have only been in half of the film, but she was a superstar, just as Celeste was. Every scene was electric with her, especially the final sequence at her concert, which is one of the most stunningly directed scenes of the year from what I've seen. Raffey Cassidy does double duty here, playing young Celeste, as well as her daughter, and does both seamlessly. Some of the film's best moments are in the first act, and Cassidy has some of the best monologues as well. Celeste's character is very relatable at times, and towards the end of the film, becomes somebody that nobody wants to become, creating a very interesting character arc altogether. To say that I was on the edge of my seat during the film would be an understatement. From the film's opening violence, the film is relentless. Similarly to Widows, this film keeps the interest going, even if the film does slow down a lot. Luckily, due to the fantastic performances and gorgeous cinematography, this film stays engaging throughout the entire show. Once I started thinking about what was going on, I started developing unease, especially when entering into the second act. I got a similar sense of anxiety, similar to the feeling of watching Funny Games or The Killing of a Sacred Deer, which ended up inducing a panic attack in the end for me, which was heightened in the final scene. Luckily, once the film was over, I was able to compose myself and am doing better now. Unease flows throughout the film, and you truly never know what is going to happen next. Vox Lux is one of this year's most original concepts, and has some of the strongest performances as well. It's a shame that this film is only being played at two theaters here in Vegas, since it's a film that is going to resonate with many people, even if they can't fully understand adult Celeste's choices. It's a beautifully shot film that actually makes you think about what the film is about, especially with the final narration giving even more food for thought. I may not have a complete idea what the film is about right now, but will be very interested to see how others have interpreted Corbert's vision. I hope to see this film another time on the big screen, since it's the only place that you could fully embrace what Vox Lux has to offer.
I’d heard that this was controversial in an arthouse sort of way. I don’t get it. The Snowman was more arthouse.  A total mess. A total mess I was feeling for the first act and bored of during the last. Not nearly as unconventional as it thinks.
“simply put, it was a hit”
i’m surprised that i haven’t seen much talk about the incredibly gruesome opener this has. probably the hardest thing i’ve had to watch in the theater all year, even worse than anything ‘Mr. Sophistication’ was capable of, or Olga’s dance in ‘Suspiria’.. a beautiful ambitious mess that doesn’t manage to stick the landing- the first half of the film is great, while the portman half is significantly and glaringly less so. as someone who’s been in NatPo’s thrall since ‘The Phantom Menace’, what she’s doing here is....really Not It. it’s downright grating, and if you don’t love her even half as much as me it will probably ruin this for you. maybe its because she plays Celeste at her most sympathetic while portman plays her at her least, but i thought raffey cassidy was much more compelling. still, i very much enjoyed the gimmick of her younger self and her daughter being played by the same actress, with the portman version of celeste operating as this grandiose abomination, totally removed from herself.  and as for the actual singing & dancing... think ally maine on SNL
Prelude and First Act are pretty damn good, you’re pretty much completely broken while also trying to recover a massive comeback I felt the second act was good, but I really didn’t care for that time leap as I wanted to get to experience Celiste’s journey to becoming star as it was disappointing, but still manages to be good. The finale for me was underwhelming, you got to scatter your music numbers because if you put it in all in one long act, it gets boring. Best part of that entire finale is DaFoe’s dialogue which honestly opened my mind with what the writer was going for It’s a solid movie, with majority of the film be mainly long takes of dialogue so if you can handle that you’re good to go. Excellent performances across the board
I don't feel well after watching this movie. The first scene establishes that this is a very feel-bad movie.  The camera work was A+ and I absolutely adored whatever film grain effect they used on this. The aspect ratio was an interesting choice as well.  Natalie Portman plays an absolutely despicable character who I somehow felt increadibly sorry for. The irony in that is that I initially went to see this movie knowing absolutely nothing about it, specifically because I like Natalie Portman so much (especially after Black Swan) but ended up leaving the theatre wondering of she had just delivered a performance on par with or possibly even better than that film.  Definately don't go see this if you think it's just an edgy "star is born" though. The movie opens with a graphic depiction of gun violence and it just gets more uncomfortable from there.
The film ends on an ugly and pointless stage performance from Portman’s character, and the first name in the credits is a dedication to Jonathan Demme.  I hope nobody has the gall to call this original while Sean Price Williams is still alive and working.  Natalie Portman is flailing. I lost my shit when she tried to pronounce “pterodactyl.” On that note, that diner scene is super long and so are a bunch of other scenes. For what? Where does it take us? It makes scenes feel like showcases for “acting” in lieu of having them actually be directed.  Why does the voiceover explain things that I’ve already gleaned from the film three times over?? I had a good time with it. Guys, it’s bad. But at least I could laugh at it. I cried laughing when 9/11 happened. All of Portman’s temper tantrums were hilarious. Jude Law owns. The music video/tunnel/motorcycle stuff is gorgeous. Please nobody make cultural criticism/satire through the guise of fiction without giving a shit about your characters. You can make your points without solely using people as ciphers. It’s possible to just like pop music, too lol wtf @2018.  Just please.. never ever make stuff like this.
"Vox Lux" is an ambitious and bombastic exercise in commenting about fame, popstars, and success, and draws parallels of celebrity with terrorism and tragedy. There's a lot of on-the-nose dialogue and situations that scream Corbet's commentary, and he fires his messages rapidly with reckless abandon, never taking the time to flesh out any particular one beyond the surface. I must admit I was less than impressed by Raffey Cassidy's performance in either half and both adult and young Celeste never seemed to come across as remotely the same character. The film is bookended by its two most shocking/entertaining scenes, one involving a shooting and the other being Portman's stage performance. The shooting is executed with violent surprise and impact, while the concert is handled beautifully, with outstanding makeup, lighting, and costumes for Portman. Perhaps by nature the film was made to be just as grandiose and vacuous as one of Celeste's own pop songs, complete with asides and Dafoe's narration, but Corden clearly has things to say about Celeste's rise and perpetual encounters with tragedy; the incorporation of said ideas just comes off as sloppy and unrefined. I won't lie though in saying that regardless of how trying many parts of the film could be, I was intrigued from start to finish. And Portman puts in a worthy enough performance as an unstable diva to warrant a watch. Her stage presence in the climatic finale is an absolute delight. But yea, there was zero reason to have Raffey Cassidy play both young Celeste and Celeste's daughter, while having Stacy Martin's character remain the same.
The first twenty minutes is really good for me. Everything works and we get a great idea of Corbet's style. The movie FALLS apart pretty quickly after that point which is certainly disappointing. I was hoping for it more to be like Haneke but that doesn't seem fair to criticize the movie for something I wish it was. Jude Law is a god though and him struggling to put on his very tiny sunglasses was very good.  DONT JUST COMPARE THIS MOVIE TO STAR IS BORN. IT DOES NOTHING FOR EITHER FILM
terrorism is bad and pop music is, based on this movie, also bad
So like...I was super hyped for this movie and I don’t even know why. Maybe because Scott Walker was doing the score and I really wanted to hear how that would sound from the guy who made this. Maybe it was because Natalie Portman and Jude Law are great actors and I wanted to see Raffey Cassidy emote, unlike in Killing of a Sacred Deer. I couldn’t give a reason, but this was probably one of my most anticipated movies this season and I felt super weird about it.  I don’t really want to say anything more than I have to about the opening scene, but it felt very real. And it was, uh, a lot. It may well be the most disturbing thing I’ve ever watched. Thus began a 110-minute odyssey of complex emotion, the ramifications of people changing, and the blurred lines between good and bad intentions. It’s a movie that continually throws up little red flags, again and again, and ends on a fever pitch. The more I think about it the more I think this may be my favorite movie of the year, but that doesn’t change the fact that this is a difficult film that rewards patience and analysis with an enthralling character study rooted in modern culture.  This movie, like its central character, has so many emotions that can change from moment to moment but there’s something real and honest about all of them. At times funny, tragic, scary, and uplifting, this movie just hops from little moment to little moment, but every revelation feels important and powerful. This is a very crafted film, the kind refined from deep meditation on what it’s trying to say and how it wants to go about that, and by the end it’s definitely made it’s point.  I don’t even want to say I recommend this movie because it’s a lot to stomach and, honestly, wholly unenjoyable. With that said, this is an amazing artistic achievement that may capture American pop culture more than anything else I’ve ever seen, and even if I never watch it again (which seems unlikely) I will buy it and I will not forget it.
A messy movie for messy times.  Vox Lux probably bites off more than it can chew, but its aftertaste is unforgettable, if not extremely bitter. This is a movie about everything and nothing, that’s point is there is no point. It’s a reverse Trojan horse, where the twist ends up not being what’s hiding under the surface, but what’s hiding in plain sight.  Vox Lux suggests our problem isn’t that we’ve forgotten what the horrors of modern life look like, but that we’ve become so numb to them, they might as well all be window dressing.
Sue me! I loved it!
Could have been great and often times VOX LUX gets really close; this is probably the most conflicting movie of the year for me.  Spanning about 20 years, the film is split into three very different acts. The presentation of the entrances and exits—through text, narration (an omniscient and foreboding Willem Dafoe), interstitial scenes—was one of the most exciting aspects of the film. The beginning and end credits are especially well done.  Unfortunately, the exciting aspects of the film is followed by relatively uninteresting directing in most scenes—the production design is often impressive but Corbet never seems to be in command with his shot selection. The events of the film are often wild and crazy but the formal presentation seldom gets close to the same level—I found the camera to not be subjective enough. This may have been intentional so that Corbet could provide an unaffected look at Celeste but I think this approach gives prominence to the artifice in a way that is distracting.  I could never pinpoint if Portman’s performance was too on the nose or over the top—her accent was especially distracting. I gave her, being the incredible actress that she is, the benefit of the doubt. Looking back on it now, I think it is a very good performance, the scene before the finale is great acting and relieved most grievances I had earlier on in the film. That being said, I don’t think I would have been in disbelief in the first place if Corbet’s direction were more daring in dialogue scenes—I think that about sums up my feelings towards the film as a whole; all the parts that you could feel Corbet’s presence were great. There were moments where it feels that the supernatural (the subjectivity of Corbet) is in play and then the rest seems like a documentary which was disappointing.  The film is at its best when there is presentation of text on screen, Willem Dafoe’s poetic and strange narration, and especially the non-diegetic score which I was floored to find out in the opening credits was composed by Scott Walker (one of my favorite musicians, mostly because his songs and arrangements are so dissonant and cinematic). As a Sia fan, I found the songs to be rather lackluster (not bad but none of the songs pack a punch) but whenever the score came in I was riveted—there is jarring editing and imagery that just pulls you in but eventually lets you go once you get back to the story. I couldn’t get enough of those types of moments.  Corbet dedicates the film to Jonathan Demme at the end which is strange because during the live performance I was hoping to see something more akin to Demme’s direction—unfortunately, Corbet’s direction is probably more akin to Singer’s in BOHEMIAN RHAPSODY than Demme in STOP MAKING SENSE. That was one of the things I found myself doing during this film: imagining what another director would do with the great concept. If Lars Von Trier directed this film it would probably be my favorite of the year. Alternatively, I found myself thinking about what Josephine Decker (MADELINE’S MADELINE) would have done with this material.  Anyways, I really love the thematic material Corbet touches on, I love the character, the spectacle—the conceptual framework of this movie is something I am extremely interested in and I think it is incredibly relevant material. The reason I say so much (sorry for rambling) about it is because of how close it gets to being something spectacular. Unfortunately though, VOX LUX falls short more than it sticks the landing.  P.S. Jude Law is daddy (we stan a legend)
I can’t stop thinking about when I was around 7 I said my favorite actress was Natalie Portman and that still holds up to this day. she’s too powerful .... and i can’t stop thinking about this film.
Big thanks to the guy in front of me who was Shazaming songs near the end of the film.
I was dazed. The film starts in an insane and awful place and my blood quite literally ran cold and I shivered. And then, in a sick way I got excited. Because I haven’t kept up with this film so I don’t know how heavily advertised it is, but this film does not start anywhere close to where I thought it would. It starts in a hellhole. With Willem Dafoe narrating. And it clashes together different filmmaking styles and soundscapes and editing techniques and decided almost period acting choices that pair well with some of the almost period music cues. And it’s a whirlwind of barely controlled chaos. But it is controlled. By a skillful conductor at the eye of the storm in Brady Corbet. And what he creates is mesmerizing. As is Raffey Cassidy who bizarrely but impressively and skillfully plays both young Celeste and Celeste’s Daughter in the two halves of the story. And Stacy Martin, who plays her sister Eleanor in both halves. And then Natalie Portman plays Celeste in Part 2. With Jude Law as the Manager in both parts.   It’s insanely disorienting but only by design. You never get a second to catch your breath except in the long take, disgustingly uncomfortable and intimate conversational scenes between characters. You never get to sit and process because Celeste never gets to as the film takes on an unholy journey through her rapid ascension. And truthfully, THIS is the film that feels most most accurate and brutally honest in its portrayal of the American Dream and what it costs to take it. What it means to pursue it. What a Star requires to be born. This is a film that scares and I don’t want to talk to specifically about it because I know I have to see it again and that bone jarring opening is still with me....and I don’t want to give away anything in this awful awful brilliantly conceived film as I clumsily explore it. But this is something special. Something different. Something true. There’s a voice here. There’s a story here. It’s told in a way I never would have expected. It’s a kaleidoscope of feeling and memory. It feels like if A Star is Born was directed by Nicholas Winding Refn taking cues from 20th Century Women. I know how that sounds. It’s something to see. Corbet makes bold choices editorially and they really paid off for me. They won’t for many. It’s a specific film. But it’s to be cherished and seen and thought about.
112-minute long anxiety attack.   Natalie Portman is a marvel.
you ever see a film so good and so accurate and everything is so perfect you can’t form words in an articulate way? yeah that’s me right now!
Very scattered thoughts because I still can’t decide how I feel about this one. I didn’t hate it overall, but I can’t even really focus on what I enjoyed. First off, I have NEVER in my life seen a movie try so hard to be profound, and fail so miserably. Would be absolutely unwatchable without Natalie Portman and Jude Law. Raffey Cassidy needs to hire a new dialect coach and learn how to enunciate because I can barely understand anything she says. The film tries to do so much, but just comes across as flat and disingenuous. MAYBE I’m being too harsh because I can’t get past my initial disappointment. The connection between terrorism and pop music is so fucking hamfisted. The screenplay needed a complete overhaul. Also, I’ve never seen a film so beautifully shot and so abysmally edited. What’s his face needs to go to film school.
Natalie should really stick to rapping.
Everyone sees something else when they look at me like I’m not real like I’m a character in a movie he’s telling me that he’s forgotten me like it means nothing like it all means nothing three years of utter nothingness
So I missed the school shooting scene as I came into the cinema as soon as the opening credits started rolling, but I’m sure that didn’t take away from the raw beauty and relentless truth of this film. Natalie’s performance is one of the best of the year, and is definitely worthy of an Oscar nomination. I also adored the final concert performance. The film’s themes on gun violence, and addiction (!!!), were portrayed extremely well. Literally A Star Is Born but with Columbine.
Natalie Portman was great but I just don’t really care for the rest of the film. The opening sequence was starteling but what would follow just didnt continue the edge that we are first shown.  2018 Ranked
Temporarily lifting my ban on Using The Word “Pretentious” To Describe A Movie for this very special exception, which I quite enjoyed most of!
It looks great! I mean in a literal sense: the visuals in this were absolutely incredible, and my favorite part of the film. I also mean this in the sense that it sounds like a great concept: Natalie Portman as a broken pop star haunted by her trauma. I actually was super excited for this, but ultimately it just wasn't for me. I was surprised when Portman didn't show up until about halfway through. We were left with Raffey Cassidy (who I loved in last year's The Killing of a Sacred Deer) but I thought that there could've been a little more emotion in her performance. Her character does a lot of big things and I didn't really feel sold on a lot of her acting. I wish this movie was a little longer and perhaps done a bit of a higher budget so they wouldn't constantly gloss over interesting plot points with the narration (read very nicely by Willem Dafoe). The second half was a lot better than the first for me, mostly because of the addition of Portman's beautifully strange performance and her ??? accent. The concert scene looks absolutely amazing, but (this might be just me) the song's aren't very good? I was surprised I wasn't into them because they were written by Sia and I'm usually into her music, but the song's (both in the ones sung by Cassidy and Portman) don't sound very good to me. There's a couple stylistic choices that kinda felt a little annoying. I know I'm not the one to judge what a director finds to be a good choice for their film stylistically, but i think the decision to constantly speed things up in montage looked really strange (in a not so good way). That's really the only negative I have regarding how the film looked. The opening scene was very disturbing and probably my favorite part of the film. It's very disturbing and I think it presents the trauma Celeste, the film's protagonist goes through. If there's one thing some of the first scenes in the film, and the first half in general do well, is establish an interesting relationship between Celeste and her older sister. It definitely could have been more fleshed out, but it was one of the more interesting aspects of a film. I find the thesis of this story very interesting: how trauma can shape a modern pop musician. I just wish that it was explored a little differently so see how young Celeste morphed into older Celeste, because the two seem to be very different characters. I'm upset I didn't like this more. I love Portman and I thought the trailer was incredible. Maybe I'll like it more on a second watch
Amazing movie.  In my opinion Natalie Portman is one of the best if not THE best actress of all time. She makes you believe in every character she portrays - even as a kid she was totally stellar in every role she took on.  This movie is excellent and has a ton of hidden meaning! It’s moving as well
just so everyone knows this is the best film of the year. thank you and goodnight.
..... Lemme just say that Natalie Portman is absolutely phenomenal in this and Willem Dafoe narrating this was just bone chilling. The last 20 minutes felt like I was in a real concert, this whole movie is wild and keeps you entertained for the whole 2 hours. Aight bye
This film was magnificent. I really hate reading lengthy reviews so I’ll try to keep this as short as possible but essentially this film is about how the character Celeste (Natalie Portman) rises to become a star from a tragedy that happens to her as an adolescent.  Through the entire film I was comepletely in awe by how well directed it was , the stunning visuals, the score, and the performances.  But what REALLY stood out was how well Natalie Portman played her part. Though I’m not surprised at all by her impressive performance in this, it is still incredible to see her in her element.
Brady Corbet is an extremely talented filmmaker and has a lot to say in this film, Natalie Portman has never been better and that is saying something.
i don’t think this is going to work for everyone but its exploration of fame arising from the aftermath of trauma alongside the trauma from said fame i found riveting to watch. the film doesn’t try to apologize for celeste’s many faults or glorify aspects of her life that are pretty fucked up. the tagline of this being a portrait is so appropriate—it presents celeste as she is. the narrator, when he does have something to say, is documentary-like in his delivery. it’s not asking for a value judgment.  also: the use of raffey cassidy in the second half of the film was such a fantastic choice. the depth it added to those scenes is just [chef’s kiss]
Woof. Ok, imagine A Star is Born but it’s instead about Ray of Light-era Madonna who’s a survivor of Columbine for some reason that ties two more terrorist attacks into her life as a substance-abusing deadbeat. That’s it, that’s literally the movie. Oh and it’s a tribute to Jonathan Demme despite it having really lame live concert footage. Natalie is magnetic in this, she deserves GOAT status in the current state of her career. But this was just too bizarre to recommend or ever see again. I’m glad I saw it and was fascinated by how far it goes in certain aspects, but I’m not sure what it was going for in the end.
I’m at a loss of words so lemme just say that the first 10 minutes sank my heart into pure oblivion. I was shocked, polarized, disturbed, and taken 1000000% off guard by what the fuck this movie was going to entail. Might be some of the scariest and downright disturbing shit I have seen in a movie all year and I sat through Hereditary twice. More to come. Maybe. Idk. Give Natalie Portman and Raffey Cassidy the fucking Oscars already. Vox Lux fuxed with my head.
It’s so easy to read into this character, and that’s what sells this movie. Natalie Portman is great as expected, but so is the actress playing her young self, which came as a nice surprise. Certain aspects of this movie were very disturbing and unique, even though the plot’s trajectory is something we’ve seen many times before. I would recommend this one for sure.
This was such an interesting watching experience. The beginning promised greatness. The middle promised me lightness. The end promised nothing. In fact, it took back those promises and said YEET. What a weird film.
I'm not entirely sure of what Brady Corbet is doing here, but I'm pretty sure that he is mostly sure of what he's doing, and the people he's got on board with him seem sure enough about what he's convinced them that he is totally and undeniably sure of. Does that make sense? Kind of, right? That's the movie. Despite its touch-and-go unevenness, I'd be lying if I said I wasn't a sucker for some pretty-looking artbait about popstars that don't give a fuck and tragedies on the world stage and the certainty of having angles and unique arty visual sequences and Jude Law lurking in the shadows and some good music to boot Do I sound negative? I can't tell. That's not what I'm getting at, if I do sound that way. While it wasn't without its problematic technical and structural choices, I really enjoyed this film, which is more than I can say for the rest of the (mostly older) crowd at Philadelphia's Ritz East Theater, one of which stood up at the end and loudly proclaimed to his wife "This was even worse than First Reformed," so any chance of a friendship there is absolutely ruined. I digress. I'll be thinking about this one for a while and, really, isn't that one of the better things a film can do for you?

a star is born but for crackheads???
This is an absolute MESS. And I really loved it. Natalie is amazing, and it’s definitely ambitious. It’s such a great concept but I wish it was made by a better filmmaker!!  It’s such a heartbreaking exploration into how violence shapes us and how we try to make sense out of senseless violence. That ending really made me mad though lmao like what?
i keep seeing reviews and articles about how awful and unlikeable celeste is... and i have to say i really don’t get it. she survived a tragedy and was almost immediately launched into international stardom, and like anyone whose had to grow up too fast, she’s a little emotionally stunted from these two cataclysmic life events.  she’s not more unlikeable than a walter white/don draper type (which is painfully cliche to use as a comparison at this point, i know) and she’s a much more interesting music figure than ally or jackson maine in a star is born (another futile comparison as the two films couldn’t be more different). so the hate is a bit much of you ask me.  natalie portman and raffey cassidy knock it out of the park. also raffey and stacy martin playing sisters is something i didn’t know i needed?? the cast was really strong
Modernity is born from the destruction of tradition through tragedy. And Vox Lux explores this idea through the rise and decay of the “celebrity” in an almost anti-art art film. It doesn’t always show exactly what it means, just like Portman’s character, but it doesn’t have to. Is a highly scrutinized fame on par with murderoys infamy? Brady Corbet is not here to answer these questions, but to simply ask them at the most inopportune, uncomfortable, but perhaps equally most important time.
First five or so minutes of this film shocked the hell out of me and yet held for the movie this gritty and washed out aesthetic and vibe of the rest to come, much like the characters' evolutions, especially towards the end. +100 points for Sia's music and dope costumes as well.
This is what happens when you let film bros make movies. So bombastic it can’t even show establishing shots of New York City without intrusive percussion and overwhelming music. Brady Crobet just turned 30 this year. But this is a movie very much still steeped in the sensibilities of a 20-something cinephile. You know, the kind of guy whose highest praise for a film is that it is a “fucking masterpiece.” Crobet is clearly trying to make his “fucking masterpiece” with Vox Lux. I can imagine him being raised on a lot of the indie and foreign hits of the 2000s. He seems to respond strongly to that specific fusion of dizzying camerawork, dense montage, and aforementioned overwhelming music. He tops it off by adding some cultural commentary for the film bros to dissect in predictable ways online afterwards in order to complete their “fucking masterpiece” experience. But it’s all pretty bad and boring. Honestly, who would have thought watching someone else strive so hard for intensity and emotion in every stylistic choice could be so dull?
Its strength is clearly in its first half, but even the shift to a cynical pop star with a questionable accent can't quite derail the sporadically powerful commentary on the tenuous connection between fame and infamy.
A strange portrait that is both obvious and confusing, thematically resonant and idiotic. It isn't exactly the movie I wanted, but it's hard to think of a movie that better captures the time we live in. One where the culture is dominated by violence and the media's desperate need to churn our suffering into cash, to create heroes from ordinary people, leaving the people ruined. We suck but we are also kind of beautiful and so is this movie, I guess. Like the narrator of this film, it's sort of a Van Gogh, perhaps better appreciated after its time as a cult classic. For now though, watching this film is painful and funny not only because it sometimes falls into parody but because more often than not, it doesn't.
“A 21st Century Portrait” is how director Bryan Corbet subtitles his sophomoric effort, “Vox Lux.” I can think of a handful of films that are far more deserving of this subtitle, some of which I even saw this year: films such as “Sorry to Bother You,” Boots Riley’s surreal and phantasmagoric exploration of racism and class struggle and “Minding the Gap,” Bing Liu’s sympathetic portrait of youth, parenthood, and making ends meet in Middle America. Heck, given the recent revelations of Facebook’s relationship with Cambridge Analytica, how the latter harvested data from millions of users without their consent and how Facebook hired a lobbying firm to silence its critics, David Fincher’s and Aaron Sorkin’s “The Social Network” (2010) is THE “21st Century Portrait” par excellence. That’s not to say that “Vox Lux” is lacking in ideas, it’s just that Corbet doesn’t know what to do with them; he opts to throw everything against the wall to see what sticks, instead of thinking things through.

What a weird movie. It’s filmmaking style is very strange. Also super depressing. There’s some pretty visceral violence that I wasn’t expecting going into this. While I’m not usually sensitive to violence in films, this just caught me off guard and felt a little too real. I can certainly appreciate this movie’s commitment to its style. It was exectuted in a odd way but props to them for not holding back on it. Probably the only movie I’ve seen where the credits roll at the beginning. Interesting experiment but they’re rolling like over the movie so it’s a bit distracting.  Natalie Portman and Jude Law really shine. They’re so committed to their characters and they have really great chemistry on screen. I was also impressed with the actress that played young Natalie Portman. Her Portman impression is really great.  Story-wise, it’s got some really great themes. Familiar themes, but it tells the story well enough. I was unaware going in that Sia wrote the music, but you can definitely tell it’s her writing once you hear it. Overall a well told, if depressing, story with an off putting execution and good themes. But if you’re looking for something a bit more uplifting I’d go for Bohemian Rhapsody or A Star Is Born.
And The Devil made her repeat, This is ten percent luck Twenty percent skill Fifteen percent concentrated power of will Five percent pleasure Fifty percent pain And a hundred percent reason to remember the name
Arresting, if flawed, vehicle for Natalie Portman to shine. Gorgeous cinematography, set up, editing, soundtrack and tonal work here.
Laughably pretentious*. Literally laugh-out-loud pretentious, numerous times. Fun seeing this with a crowd. Thought I was in the wrong theater/movie for roughly ten minutes. Startlingly dark in places, including certain scenes straight out of a Bret Easton Ellis adaptation.  BUT...certainly far from boring or bland, and not least of all due to some excellent lead performances. Loved Portman, loved Law**. Portman’s half of the film was more enjoyable than the front half. Top two scenes: 1. Interview scene, featuring Christopher Abbott. 2. Diner scene, featuring wine-in-a-cup. Brady Corbet has gotta be insufferable. I would call his directing style, “film school troll.” Would love an interview with the editor about how easy this job was. *See: both the opening and closing credits choices. **Do we think Jude Law is upset that Jennifer Lawrence was given the “J. Law” moniker?
This movie is a lot.
As much about how an audience needs a star as it is about how a star needs her audience. "My little angels," Celeste says on stage, living for the applause of her fans, the people who keep her going even as she slides into the oddities and mediocrities of a new realm of pop. The years keep going by and she's still the same demanding, insecure young woman who is unsure of her identity, simply spouting what the devil himself has whispered in her ear. She'll never die, no matter what she says or does though. She's Faust, but she's got soul. Her soul lives on in the music, in the personas she puts on, in the words she writes and the music her sister provides her, in the jobs she continues to supply to everyone who puts on a show, who makes an album, who helps create this icon. Pop isn't as surface level as we know it; there's so much going on in the background, trauma able to show up at any moment, but at the end of the day, the show must go on. And so it does, not with a bang, but with the same flourishes and movements and style as every other icon, as every other concert. And though we've seen it before, and Celeste exists as an icon we all know (formed from the ashes of a number of identities), she may not matter to us, but she matters to her fans - from the teen crying that she's at a Celeste show (knowing this will be one of the best nights of her life) to the sister and daughter who are along for the ride, knowing in their heart that, at the very least, in this one moment, this woman know to be a deeply damaged mess is nothing but sincere in what she's presenting on that stage. Music is as much of a damnation as it is a salvation.
I started enjoying this movie about 40 minutes in when I decided it was a comedy. I laughed my ass off at it. If that wasn't the point, then it completely missed (I'm leaning in this direction). Every time Willem Dafoe's narration kicked in, it was comic genius. And her "show" at the end was Spinal Tap levels of awful. And the score with its foreboding chords before nothing bad happens. Very possibly the worst movie of 2018.
Bodies fall and the credits roll. The story is over before it's even been told. Jude Law shines. Everyone else shines too. The final concert plays and your head is so full of incoherent contradictions and all you want to do is be in the crowd, it looks so nice, it looks right, and maybe it is.
A girl in the wake of tragedy pushing forward the only way she knows how, the only way possible. Singing for others but still reminding them that she is God. A selfless act made to distract others from their own tragedies, our collective tragedy. A self serving act made solely to keep you alive. Inherent contradictions and confused values all bouncing around in the same mind concluding with certainty that we would all truly be fucked if it weren't for all this music. If the Devil is real he's what we deserve but even more alarmingly he's what we need. We don't have any solutions but we can sing and we can turn blind eyes and we can dance with the crowd; all of which are equally valid responses to the eternal state of grief we find ourselves in. And it's only good because if it wasn't we'd all be dead. And if we were all dead then we wouldn't have a chance to hear the music.
This thing really squanders any and all good will!!!
Me dancing along to Natalie Portman and stanning this mess! media.giphy.com/media/j7c8Gcxet30Iw/giphy.gif
I liked this! I think that Childhood of a Leader is probably my personal preference of Bradley Corbet's movies but I definitely applaud the guy BIG TIME for making movies like this. I think his movies are thought provoking and great!
everything about this was awful. Only gets 1 star because the SIA songs were jammin.
Natalie Portman is a showstopper in this tale of terrorism and triumph in the face of an affected world. Although the film has its brush with glorious narration from Willem Dafoe, too often Brady Corbet’s direction feels inauthentic and mannered, like Diet Lars Von Trier- eager to let us in on the horror and grit but too aware of how it will get us there pace by pace. Outside of the narration, the scripting also struggles to detail what it finds so important about this journey as well. Using art as a catalyst for exploring suffering isn’t anything new- luckily Portman’s insanity as older, questionably wiser Celeste is enough of a jolt to anchor the film to its pop finale. If only the rest of the production was on her level.
what an ugly mess. why did a man direct this
Obnoxiously long but the final 45 minutes is some damn fine action filmmaking. Also autobots designed as Nascar stock cars will never not be funny.
I wouldn’t say it’s as bad as the previous transformers film, but this was still bad
While it could have easily shaved off 30 minutes by cutting out the love triangle and the Patrick Dempsey subplot in general, and it does have a lot of the same problems that the last two films had (annoying side characters, a couple bloated action sequences, unfunny jokes, etc.), Transformers: Dark of the Moon is certainly the best of the Bayformers movies as far as acting and directing go (although I still prefer the last film to this one). Bay seems to have much more of a grasp on this one than he did on Revenge of the Fallen, making this one feel much more focused and fun. Shia LaBeouf is also quite good in this one, and it's by far his best performance in these films. The visual effects work is also spectacular as usual, and the action sequences are genuinely exciting, even if they feel a bit bloated. It's not a great movie by any means (or really even a good one), but I think there's enough good here for me to give it a positive review. GRADE: B-
4/10 (Mediocre) I honestly couldn't care less about this film, everything is just meh. At least the first two made me feel emotion, albeit the 2nd one in a bad way. This movie just exists, not terrible but obviously not worthy enough of even an average rating. I didn't mind the majority of things I saw over the runtime of the film, but still nothing noteworthy beyond CGI, honestly.
Let me just say this was an improvement but still not a good film.
The Battle of Chicago is INSANE, but... almost all the action is centered on the humans. The Transformers themselves don’t have as many standout moments as they did in the last movie. Some of them barely make their presence known. Shia LaBeouf continues to be great (his story about finding his place is really good, but it gets dropped too quickly) and the joke are much better than the last movie (there’s way less obnoxious characters too). Sentinel Prime is also a great villain. It’s still a fantastic action movie, but the smaller focus on the Transformers does hurt it a bit. Some of the pacing in the first act is really bad too.
Intelligent, thoughtful, visually unique, emotionally driven, and thematically powerful... is something that this film is not. But it's hella fun. 6.2/10.
“Now, we need a truce. All I want is to be back in charge. Besides, who would you be without me, Prime?” “Time to find out!” Most badass moment in this whole franchise.
Whatever
I can’t get over how shitty CGI JFK looked...
I literally just a few days ago stated I would never watch this film (or the fourth one for that matter), but I didn't realize I would be very bored at the same time FX would be airing it. This is pure garbage. In Bay's defense it is better than the second film, but to be fair 'Revenge of the Fallen' is one of the worst movies I've seen in the last five years. This is just a gigantic, expensive mess. I literally have nothing else to say. Just terrible.
While the first installment still manages to capture the spectacle of the giant robots better, Transformers: Dark of the Moon is entertaining enough in its second half to make up for weak characters and unnecessary subplots.
Dark of the Moon is bad film but, it’s kind of watchable.
It's often shocking to me to see really, truly great actors in movies this bad. Paycheck, I guess? The thrill of acting to a stick with a tennis ball on it?
I spent money to get this shit at redbox why was young me so stupid
I don’t know why, but I like this one a little better than the last one. I find the tie in with the moon landing interesting, even though they don’t really go that far with it. Sentinel Prime is probably the most compelling villain so far, but that’s not saying much. There are some nice looking battles, the freeway fight, and the Chicago building collapse in particular stands out for me. This one feels like it tries to build on the mythology more, delving further into the war on Cybertron and what each side wanted out of it. Also, I know he’s crazy now, but in this and the last two movies, Shia is actually entertaining. Not everything out of his mouth is a crude joke, there’s actually some wit(wicky) to what he is saying. But hey, look – here are those things again. An attractive female lead whose ass is hanging out the second we’re introduced to her? Check. Thinly sketched new Autobots with specifically human accents or physical attributes? There’s Japanese robot, Einstein robot, and British robot with a gut. Check, check and check. Juvenile humor? I can’t even remember but probably check. Also, Optimus Prime is a straight up brutal murderer in these. However, I don’t know if it’s just the sound of Peter Cullen’s voice, but he never fails to deliver an epic sounding declaration right after the chaos abruptly ends. You cut to the credits ALMOST thinking, man, that Optimus is a hell of a leader. Once again, this is just shallow texture in place of real characterization.
Shia LaBeouf’s character, whose name I still do not remember despite marathoning these movies, seems like the kind of dude who’d complain about affirmative action. I’m sorry your Ivy League education (that your parents paid for) and your presidential medal weren’t enough to land you a job. Maybe you should have done a N.E.S.T. internship or something.
Slightly better but not good fighting robots
Really cool how this came out shortly after the war ended, bold move by Kubrick tbh.
Powerful.  Fuck the every war and the Vietnam war and fuck every U.S. president ever.
Really enjoyed it the battle was unique and the acting is killer. 2nd favorite transformer film.
This is one of those movies that falls victim to its structure. Act 1 is sensational, a mini movie on its own. But once you get the conclusion and the second 1/3rd begins, it's almost like you're watching the beginning of a sequel and it makes that entire portion of the movie DRAG But having said that, the last third of the movie is amazing. It really felt like a war setting and the message at the end is very true. Shooting a gun whilst at war and killing someone defenseless at war are two totally different things. 8.4/10
It's pretty good.
It's the first time i needed to get smashed to finished a movie and tbh even after that i still think it's not a good movie.
Though the first half of this war film is great thanks to superb acting, noteworthy themes and a strong focus on characters however the really great first half is unfortunately let down by the second half as it is a lot messier and divulges into typical Vietnam war cliches while not even really have solid action scenes to make up for them. Nonetheless the film is still engrossing throughout, the cinematography is really good and the score/soundtrack is decent.
None of the positives of the first one. Just mind numbing action
Is every Kubrick film an adaptation P.S.  No better way to end it than with the stones
Yet another masterpiece from Stanley Kubrick.
It ain't getting any better. Mrs Statham really makes you miss the acting skill of Megan Fox.
One of my favorite war genres putting it on my 2nd favorite Stanley Kubrick films (besides 2001 of course) a bit slow but that’s all, decent acting and satisfactory direction and great writing.
Relies on caricature and spectacle, but it's the movie that Battle: LA was supposed to be.
Rewatched as part of the Moviedrone podcast after giving it to my co-host in our Homework section. Truly stunning with an amazing score and only Kubrick could add comedic moments in amongst the terrors of war. 85/100
Checking off the highest grossing films list is going to be mind numbing.
You guys ready to hate me?  I’m about to GO IN and rate a ton of movies I’ve seen but not logged- and will potentially never watch again. If I have any thoughts on the film, I will put them here:  Sorry for the spam!
testimonials of what happened in vietnam and the horrifying realization of what happens in army training i very much recommend this
Brutal events and beautiful cinematography coalesce into a singular idea. I think he was trying to say something about the duality of man.
Between the ages of 13 and 15 I watched this every weekend without fail. This is the first time I've seen it since then. Before I was like "haha Hartman calls them gay and hits them!", now to these old eyes it is utterly horrible. The 2nd half is much better than I remember. The sniper, despite being her only acting role, gives a completely chilling performance. Stunning.
this film is just incredible. it tells a story about humans turning into beasts, about men failing in holding their morals up right and about how a war can fuck up one's mind. this film also has a phenominal cinematography (especially some long 'oners' following the soldier from behind in the second half of the film are extremly nice to watch) and pretty good acting.
What the fuck are these films? Michael Bay is so talented at creating on screen chaos - there's nobody out there creating insane fight scenes like those we see in the third act of this film - and he's proven with films like Bad Boys and The Rock that he can make a film with a straightforward, easy-to-follow narrative, so why is this so messy? The editing is so fucking jarring, and the pacing is so rushed during the first half of the film, yet it slows down for the second half which is basically one long battle. I don't think I've ever seen another film that seems so eager to get the build up out of the way so that it can move on to the good stuff. The hour long Chicago sequence in this film feels so much like it's just Michael Bay playing with his toys, and the rest of the story is just the perfunctory set up to explain why everyone is there and why they have to fight. Who is this film for? It's 2 1/2 hours of incoherent plot, with acclaimed actors screaming at each other and giant robots brutally murdering each other; how did this possibly make over a billion dollars? It's a mean film, full of casual murder and cruelty, and yet it's silly nonsense about fighting robots: you'd think that would only appeal to a small subset of people, but apparently not! I get the feeling that Michael Bay enjoys making the technical side of these films (the stunt work is absolutely insane) but at the same time hates his audience and is making this series as a big "fuck you", which would explain why they seem to get increasingly incoherent and messy as the series goes on? "Want to watch robots blowing stuff up huh? Well fuck you, if you want that you'll have to try following this story you bitches!" I think I liked it? I admire the sheer level of technical skill on display, some of the action scenes are incredible, and I actually quite like Shia LaBoeuf as the lead (Mark Wahlberg is a poor, poor replacement) as well as some of the supporting cast, but Rosie Huntingon-Whitely is really bad! The pacing is so jumpy and jarring, and there's such a miniscule amount of story at the centre of this that's it's hard to get invested; you feel like you've been stranded in the middle of Michael Bay's overactive imagination. These films and their success are honestly kind of fascinating, and I'm really curious to see how they're looked back on in the future. P.S. The human bad guy, who betrays humanity to the Decepticons, lives in Trump Tower. Michael Bay was so far ahead of the game with his political commentary!
Just what exactly has to happen to a person that makes them become a drill sgt?  Sgt Hartman does possess some devastating one-liners though - if only he was just a little more angry he could’ve been a standup comedian. Imagine what he’d be like at home with his wife... “Let me see you put some suds on those plates honey! If you don’t get them spotlessly clean I’ll pull off your ears and piss through your head!” Or even, “When I count three, the blow-jobbing shall begin. Grip that thing correctly now! You will perform this act all night if we have to!”
I'm sick and bored so gonna rattle off a couple movies I watched on the plane and at home while sick and bored: Every American in this movie is a piece of shit. I fully agree with that sentiment.
suddenly I hate cinema
Insightful. The vietnam war truly sucked 🤦🏿‍♂️
michael bay as a 9/11 truther. government conspiracies stacked on top of one another, also might be the closest i’ve seen him come to liberalism considering his usual patriotic slant. movement characterized as chaos. this is obviously trash cinema, but that doesn’t change the fact that bay puts more thought into his cgi compositions than almost all of these other blockbuster filmmakers.
I was not high when I watched this movie.
I don’t love war films but it’s Kubrick so yeah it’s great
The fact this lifeless film has such an amazing supporting cast boggles the mind.
This is such a depressing yet funny movie. A movie only made by Kubrick could make me feel like this. It slowly escalates towards a more depressing nature and it's one of the best movies that show how war changes a person's mind and twists it. I feel like Kubrick often made movies about how humanity sucks and this is just one of them. It shows how pointless things are sometimes and how death is meaningless, but it's funny how it ends on a happier note. I love this movie and I would write something longer and more in depth, but I gotta watch Under the Silver Lake rn and take away Andrew Garfield's money.
Hear me out. The action is incredible, and it doesnt feel like a "shower me with cgi, I am a dirty pig" type of action. The movie is long, so watch it with a pizza or some other food like chicken wings or chicken tenders, get them spicy and really wet so you can lick your fingers to the bone. (Wash your hands afterwards, maybe you get a hot date and you don't want no stinky spicy fingers my homie). Okay, T3. It's just stupid fun, have a good time, eat food, enjoy the film for what it is.
- confession time i suppose: this has never been anywhere near my favorite Kubrick film. i always liked it, i thought it was good, and i've grown to think it's doing a lot of interesting things thematically. but it just had never really resonated enough to place it in personal canon territory. even so, this is probably the kubrick film i've seen the most, for various contextual reasons. - i have to say, watching it now for my 5th or 6th viewing, my feelings on it still mostly hold... for all but one portion of the film. and that's the ending sniper scene. i've now grown to consider it one of the most otherworldly stretches in Kubrick's oeuvre, rivaling some of the best scenes in 2001 or Barry Lyndon. this scene alone justifies claiming the 2nd half as blowing the much lauded 1st half out of the water as far as i'm concerned. - i also feel like this is one of the few Vietnam war films that completely and unambiguously portrays the U.S. military and its participation in that event as an absurd atrocity while managing to do so in an extremely well measured (tonally speaking) way. i do appreciate it quite a bit for that.
Kubrick continues his winning streak with this work of art. Full Metal Jacket is a pretty unique war movie. It’s unpredictable, features a great script and has Stanley Kubrick’s directing, so what more could you ask for?
'Full Metal Jacket' is an interesting film as Kubrick never really made anything else that featured such an incredible change in tone midway through the film. Most, myself included, prefer the first half focusing on boot camp as opposed to the second half war, but that's not to shine a negative light on the latter. The complete film is intense, tight, and comedic at times. While it may not be the most original film Kubrick made, or unique from a war-film perspective, what 'Full Metal Jacket' does better than its contemporaries is effectively communicate its message and themes.
Dark of the Moon is definitely an improvement over the previous film. The CGI and sound design are once again amazing. Unfortunately, the film is overlong, the story is thin, and the acting needs improvement. That being said, the last hour of the film is basically one long action sequence with some of the best action in the franchise.
I originally saw this a long time ago when it first came out on VHS. I didn’t really care for it all that much. In fact, it wasn’t really all that memorable. Two years ago, I saw the DVD at a flea market for a dollar so, since it’s Kubrick, I thought maybe I should give it a second chance. So, I popped the disk in the tray and the first thing I noticed is that the film isn’t in the letterbox format which is a bit of a bummer but there’s not much I can do about that. Anyway, I think I was right the first time. This just isn’t my kinda film. It’s so grim and never really comes together as a comprehensive whole. In fact, it just leaves you feelin’ kinda shitty when it’s done. I guess that shouldn’t be too surprising for a war film but who wants to feel like they’ve been kicked in the junk after a two-hour sit-down? Nevertheless, there are some good moments here so it wasn’t a total waste of time. I give this a 6 outta 10 and although I own it, I don’t think I’ll be watching it again.
Megatron goes from being the most dominant and powerful Transformer in the franchise to being one-shotted by Optimus. Fuck this movie.
A painfully visceral 2 hours of essential viewing
The ineffable charm of Sam Witwicky. One of my most anticipated rewatches. Particularly followable (for better or worse), but Bay’s direction remains anything but obvious.  Edit: the morning after, I find myself with a fatigued eye
kinda disappointed in that one. I mean it's an excellent movie and when it first came out it probably was revolutionary to some people but watching this one after watching other "war" movies feels weird....idk but maybe the message isn't THAT deep...war is complex, killing people is hard, what does a soldier fights for? kills for? is this necessary? are we the bad guys or the good guys? It definitely involves all these questions but isn't transcendent to me...Plus, I don't get why switching the movie so hard after the first part...Anyway, it's still very good and important but I whish it had a smarter plot (but I understand this version tho) :)
Blu ray watch  Still a bit disappointed
Only slightly less insipid, annoying, and convoluted than its predecessor. 3/10
Kubrick shows with this film why he is one of the most renowned directors of all time. Due to the breath-holding suspense and the phenomenal acting, this movie does not let you go.
Out of touch and confusing. The only thing that keeps you in the cinema are the action sequences.
“Seven-six-two millimeter. Full metal jacket.” PREVIOUS REVIEW I explained the premise and said a couple of quotes to my dad and he said it sounded really good so we watched it together, hence the extremely short breaks between rewatched. He loved it and gave it a 9/10.  Hot Take: The second half of this film is just as good as the first, it’s more rich thematically, just as funny, harrowing and entertaining and just as well made.  This is still one of the finest character studies, it has impeccable direction, phenomenal performances, a masterful script, with great editing.  Fun Fact: Vincent D'Onofrio gained 70 pounds for his role as Pvt. Pyle, breaking Robert De Niro's movie weight-gain record for Raging Bull. It took him seven months to put the weight on and nine months to take it off with physical training. 98/100 Would Recommend!
When a 31 year old film set during the Vietnam war feels just as relevant today by masterfully showing how young recruits are dehumanized into effective soldiers, and is made possible by iconic performances by R. Lee Ermey and Vincent D'Onofrio and the direction and vision of Stanley Kubrick. I talk more about Full Metal Jacket in episode 50 of the Red 7 Movie Cast podcast.

Cold, pretentious, and ultimately pointless, it has some fun moments, but mostly it just meanders and annoys. Kubrick's vison of Vietnam is overblown, and self important.
I don’t think I understood a single thing that happened ?? Also why does it have to be 2 and a half hours long 😩
The cold, detached stillness hangs heavily.
A truly truly fucked up movie. Used to be my fav Kubrick flick but I think the shining holds the throne for me these days.
The thing I find absolutely fascinating about Transformers movies is how obviously evil Optimus Prime is. He's so clearly secretly trying to conquer Earth. Its nuts!
Stress-watch
When you're in the armed forces, it's not FMJ, it's FML.
the skyscraper scene where they are flying all over the place literally is some of the craziest shit i’ve seen in any of these big budget cgi porn movies also adding tyrese shines as the comedic relief in every role he’s in... which i think is just fast and furious movies and this franchise.
I don't know what's up with me and war movies recently, but I'm loving it. No contest with Patton though, this is a new level of filmmaking. It also sports the absolute coolest title drop. One of the most terrifying shots ever closes the first part, and it's gonna haunt me forever. Love the mirroring shots before and after the first battle. In fact, the abundance of horizontal tracking shots i welcome, because they're all awesome. There is a SMILE at the end of the second battle and it's the best thing in the movie!! Every scene is so... layered? Like, each shot is so deep, but somehow looks flat. It's incredible.
Another great explosive movie. Good watch.
Would be a 5/5 if it were just Ermey and D'Onofrio tho
Optimus is a fuckin S A V A G E!
“Kiss me goodbye and write me while I'm gone Goodbye my sweetheart, Hello Vietnam.” The Good: On the surface Full Metal Jacket is an incredibly entertaining war film, but when you dig deeper there are layers of subtext that add whole new layers to the film. It’s really about the limits of a person “the duality of man”, loss of innocence and authoritarianism amongst so many other things. The most compelling aspect of the film was the toll that constant pressure and the promise of combat had on Private Pyle. The script is also extremely tight and has wonderful dialogue with a very solid narrative. Full Metal Jacket is one of the most masterfully crafted films ever. Stanley Kubrick is in complete control as per usual, the fluid and seamless camerawork was stunning and sweeping. Kubrick sets up the comedic tone with dark undertones that works well for the most part. The film while funny delivers some of the most tense segments in film history that have me holding my breath on the third watch. Full Metal Jacket is filled with excellent performances. Vincent D’Onofrio is as intimidating as he is hilarious. Each character had wonderful chemistry and identity due in part to the script, but mostly it’s the fantastic performances. The Bad: I have issues with some very minor performances that feel very out of place. I also felt there were a few moments were a humor felt very out of place and unnecessary.  Fun Fact: In the first part of the movie, in the sequences inside the barracks during the drill, a special lens was designed to keep every single Recruit in focus. Director Stanley Kubrick intended that no one was special and they all had the same treatment. 98/100 Would Recommend!
I really want to like these movies, but I don't. As eye candy, they look good, but they're shot so kinetically you can't see the eye candy. Okay, so, the Space Race was really because a UFO crashed on the moon, and we need to find out what it was. Fine, but please be consistent. This is how dumb this thing is: the first two movies were all about the All Spark. The Transformers can't fix Cybertron, so the bad guys want to turn all metal on earth into Transformers. Sure but when that doesn't work, Oh! Let's get the thing from the moon we've known was there all this time but have ignored for two movies! Brilliant! So now everyone wants the Matrix of Leadership to reach out through a wormhole to pull Cybertron to earth. Now, why exactly, if that was a possibility, did anyone even bother with the All Spark? Okay, so in the "turn your brain off and watch these things shoot up and blow up those things and eat popcorn" category, the final hour is... sufficient, I guess. Not good, but sufficient. Oh, and what was John Malkovich doing here? He's made out to be a major character, then disappears after 45 minutes? Man, this was dumb.
2 day rewatch I used to think this was a weaker Kubrick. What a fuckin fool I was!
This franchise should have died after the first film. Yet the second one happened, and so did this pile of garbage.
It seems like most things to be said about this have been said. The first half is a masterpiece. The second half pales in comparison a little bit but is still amazing. Vincent D’Onofrio and R. Lee Ermey are perfect in their roles. Every other great thing you get from Kubrick you get here.  However, there are two things I haven’t seen anybody say: 1) I love how everything in this is a little off. A little off center. A little diagonal. The camera is a little crooked. It really makes for an unsettling feeling throughout the film.  2) I gotta give props on a film in the Vietnam War for not having Fortunate Son Strong 8
unlike most people, i would consider this one to be the weakest of Micheal Bay's transformers movies. Now Mind you It is still a damn great movie but there are still some issues i have with it. For example , Ironhide's and Starscream's deaths were not well handled and felt like shock value for the sake of shock value. despite that and the pacing being off in places and some of the characters getting on my nerves or being underdevoloped, there is still alot to enjoy. my favorite aspect about this movie is Optimus Prime. I like that they show how betryal effects him and it is done well.
When people prop up these movies as "dumb fun" I despair at how low the bar for fun has become. It doesn't even feel like Bay had much fun making this. This is a passionless, dull, boring, bloated mess and I do not know why I rewatched it. My one genuine moment of enjoyment was during that bit where Shia yells about his car. Good stuff.
Um... a good Transformers movie??? Directed by Michael Bay??? Really???  Yes, if you are as surprised as I am, I actually do like the third installment of the Bayformers franchise.  No, I'm not high on that pot Shia's mom ate in the last one.  Now granted, Dark of the Moon is still a flawed movie. It still has the Bay-isms that plagued the previous films (the juvenile humor, an inconsistent tone between extremely serious and extremely stupid, an excessive runtime, and a bunch of plot holes, with the biggest being the alien cover ups which somehow go public between acts in the movie for the sake of... plot). The movie also adds an unfunny Ken Jeong, a new love interest for Shia's who technically a better actress than Megan Fox but the emotional weight of the two would have worked better with the original actress making the new relationship feel forced, and predictable plot twists.  So why is it that I enjoy this one when I don't enjoy the other two? Well, for one, it feels like Michael Bay, despite his faults as a filmmaker, actually took the backlash of the last two to heart and crafted at least a somewhat competent movie. Yes, it's stupid as crap, but the action is actually competently made where I honestly enjoyed the robot action and explosions, I found the writing decision to connect Transformers with conspiracy theories like Apollo 11 and Chernobyl hilarious yet kind of intriguing, Shia LaBeouf actually has a legit arc I somewhat cared about in this one (despite a stilted romance that works but kind of doesn't as I already mentioned), enjoyed the small appearances of John Malkovich, Frances McDormand, and ALAN FREAKING TUDYK (man that guy's underrated), and then there's Leonard Nimoy who provides his voice to the mysterious Sentinel Prime. Holy crap, is this one amazing character! Honestly, they should have made a movie solely with Nimoy's Autobot while he was still living and I'd be blown away simply for the casting choice. I can't talk about too much because Sentinel's development revolves spoilers, but let's just say it was refreshing to see a different side of Leonard Nimoy, even when he's voicing a CGI robot.  Man, I miss Spock!   Anyway, Transformers 3 is a watchable Transformers movie that has enough schlocky fun to satisfy my action cravings, even with many, many flaws. Easily the best of the bunch so far for Sentinel Prime alone.    66/100     "The needs of the many outweight the needs of the view." Wait a minute, I've heard Nimoy use that line before...
Once upon a time, I went with my parents to their work convention (that year it was in the ungodly location of St. Johns, Newfoundland - no joke) and spent a lot of time chilling in the hotel room. FULL METAL JACKET had recently come out, and was the featured selection on the pay-per-view channel. I watched the trailer for it a gazillion times, and even watched part of it scrambled (this was the 80s after all) so I could hear, not see it. Later, when I purchased the VHS and finally got to see it, I couldn't get enough of the early training sequences with Lee Ermey, but then sort of tuned out once the picture moves to Vietnam. Vietnam in FULL METAL JACKET looks nothing like the Vietnam in any of the other 'Nam pics like THE DEER HUNTER or PLATOON. Many veterans are quick to point out that fact as well, and a book about Vietnam films spends a chapter slamming this one because of that. But the barren, surreal look of the FULL METAL JACKET vision of Vietnam adds to it's mystery. It almost looks like it's on another planet. None of the helicopters used look like the ones from archival footage, and the lighting is strange and ethereal, especially in the final sequence where the platoon takes on a sniper. The real crux of the picture though are those scenes in training camp with Ermey completely stripping these men down of their ego and all the baggage they come in with, and sending them out the door as trained killers, courtesy of the of United States Marine Corp. He's so good at his job in fact, that his constant degradation and humiliation of the simple Gomer Pyle (Vincent D'Onofrio) gets the desired effect and then some. I have usually considered FULL METAL JACKET (along with EYES WIDE SHUT) to be among Kubrick's weaker films. JACKET has grown on me over the years, and this viewing is thanks to seeing FILMWORKER and in which this picture plays a big part in the narrative. I am going to dive into the commentary which features D'Onofrio and Ermey because that is one set I would have loved to been on, standing off to the side and seeing this chaos unfold. There is no way either of those two were not scarred during those moments. D'Onofrio is stronger than Modine even, whose character really doesn't do all that much outside of observing. But now, more than ever, the picture no longer grinds to a halt once the picture exits basic training.
After the utter disaster of Revenge of the Fallen, we come to the final film in the Shia LaBeouf trilogy that, while a massive improvement over 2, still doesn't quite beat the first film or even Age of Extinction personally. To be fair, this is a lot better than the second film. The pacing remembers to slow down every once in a while, someone reminded Michael Bay what a tripod is so the camera isn't constantly shaking around, Sentinel Prime makes for a much better villain than the Fallen, buoyed by a legitimately good performance from the late Leonard Nimoy, and they managed to make Optimus Prime on a jetpack actually awesome this time. However, many of the problems with the first two films are still very much present here. There is still far too much focus on the human characters, complete with an entirely useless human bad guy this time around. The Decepticons' designs still aren't distinct from one another at all, to the point where you probably wouldn't even know that Barricade from the first one is in this movie unless you looked it up on the Transformers Wiki like I did. The Battle of Chicago sequence is basically just a shittier version of The Avengers, and this film starts Optimus Prime down the path to becoming a murderous asshole in 4 and 5, even if him killing Sentinel is more or less justified. So yeah, Dark of the Moon, better than the last one, but it's still a Transformers movie. Onto Age of Extinction! Side note: It took me until this particular viewing of these movies to fully realize how utterly pointless Josh Duhamel's character is.
On second watch I have a new appreciation for "Full Metal Jacket". I still prefer the first part, I think is fascinating how the minds of the soldiers are slowly shaped in order to "reborn" as a killing machines. But now I liked a second part a lot more. The normalization of violence and the manipulation of the media was a lot more apparent on this watch, making this half feel like the aftermath of the first, which I didn't quite like on my original watch. Its not one of my favorites of Kubrick, but its certainly a different way to view the war and I can only appreciate that.
Same old action, beyond 0 plot. 40/100
I lost the will to live approximately 154 times during this movie but never more than when actual fucking Buzz Aldrin showed up to congratulate one of Michael Bay's big dumb robots for being an American hero
ME SO HORNY. Leads us and a battalion of grunts through their boot camp and onwards to them serving in the Vietnam War, there’s lots of different ailments during war. We explore them. It’s a film of two halves, literally. There’s quite a big contrast to me, not in terms of quality, but content. Although, the first half is much better, because it explores a different aspect of war. R. Lee Ermey and Vincent D’Onofrio are both fantastic in completely different ways and a lot of the time they both make you feel really uncomfortable, like the situation itself. It really focuses on the psychological tolls of war, and of people. It’s not only the enemy that can kill you, and it’s not only the enemy that’s killing Americans in this specific context. The second half of the film goes for a more traditional side of a war film, although it still does do it a little differently. It’s very comedic, doesn’t show too much gunplay and always tries to give us this conflicting feeling that some of the characters are fully open to and even almost happy about what they’re doing, but others are more prone to question what’s actually going on. It adds a human realism to the situation for me, and I appreciate the fact. Obviously from a film making point of view it’s next to flawless, but that doesn’t take away from one half being much better than the other for me. Also, does anyone else get really uncomfortable listening to these “killing machines” singing these upbeat songs together? It’s very macabre. I think it represents the tone of this film perfectly. I’m not a war guy, or a war film guy. This was great, but the quality of each half is a bit too mixed to award it any higher. Still, the first half is brilliant. 4.
This film is one of the rare cases in this segment where we will say that the film deserves the bad score it got, but we still dig it. Great action, ridiculous moments, goofy characters: what more do you want?
The first 45 minutes were easily the best parts imo
The action is just awesome here, plus Rosie Huntington-Whiteley is gorgeous that glass building being shredded by Shockwave is a perfect example of VFX done right !
I recently watched this again. Holy wow it’s good even though it was made a long time ago. Classic
Admittedly only watched this to make sense of all the references made in Community, but I was NOT expecting that level of violence, especially from TV’s favourite dads!
8/10: Great
Tired: Wanting a Come And See Criterion Release Wired: Wanting criterion to re-release the Robocop Criterion on blu-Ray
(Old impressions, not based on a recent viewing) I saw this in the theater with my friends and as the final fight was ending, my friend remarked "all that is missing is a shot of an American flag" and ten seconds later, that's exactly what happened: the camera tracked back and a somewhat burnt American flag entered the shot.
R Lee Ermey's insults are both hilarious and terrifying at the same time also I'm pretty sure this film hands down has the best soundtrack ever.
I liked the first Transformers film but the sequels I’ve endured have all been shite!
the first half of the film???? maybe stanley kubrick does matter
Robocop is an action packed, violent fun film with just enough emotional scenes in between and great characters and scenes to make it a classic. Percentage: 90%
Vincent D'Onofrio is a god. See also: Jarhead
The lack of inflection in the line "Bitches, leave" is so funny to me in such a particular way. Also, spot all the Twin Peaks actors !! I mean, what can really be said about Robocop? It's basically perfect.
Dark Of The Moon is a huge improvement over revenge of the fallen. It’s by far the second best in the series.  The performances are much better in this one. The plot isn’t all over the place like it was in the previous film. The action is pretty great in this one too.  And of course the special effects are really good. Although the first half of this movie isn’t that great. It’s not interesting and a bit boring.  Sams new girlfriend is okay at best. Her performance is actually decent if I’m being honest. But Chris Stuckmann said in his review for this movie that they should have let Sam be single.  And I agree completely with that. We didn’t really need another girlfriend for Sam to deal with and Scream her name in the final action sequence. The last half of this movie is just all action and it’s so cool.  But this movie didn’t have much of an ending. It just sort of abruptly ends. There is no end of trilogy goodbye here.  Overall Dark of the Moon was a hell of a lot better than I remember it being. I actually quite enjoyed rewatching the film.  One more movie to go in my rewatches of the Transformers films and then I’m done. I’m not reviewing the 5th one considering I already have. And plus I hate that movie so there’s that.  Grade: B-
The first 45 minutes is pure gold, the rest is also really good, however nothing beats the drill instructor!
This film was okay, but nothing more. It was way too drawn out and the action was pretty boring. The first half was much more entertaining in my opinion. Since I only heard bad of these films I was expecting this to be terrible but it really isn't. The writing decent enough and so is the acting. I also really like Shia Labeouf as an actor.
Stan Lee Cool Brick
A complete mixed bag. Quality ranges from great to garbage at multiple points. Sam at least has something to do, but the film is bogged down by so many unintentionally silly (albeit badass) moments.
This is my riffle This is my Gun!
Robocop was my favorite film of all time as a kid up until the 1993 release of Jurassic Park. As a kid, it was mesmerizing... I mean come on, it brought me #robots... The visual effects were as stunning as The Terminator or Aliens, and the story was dark and enthralling. My appreciation has only grown through the years. As an adult, I've appreciated Verhoeven's willingness to leverage his style to make a commentary on 1980s corporate America, and the demise of the Detroit-centered automobile manufacturing industry. The commentary is executed in the most genius and artful ways possible. The film doesn't need to preach its message. This is emphasized by obscure details like how ED209 represents a bulky and clumsy and expensive pile of junk, just as overfunded and overconfident as some American automobiles of the era. Robocop just really sticks its landing, but more impressive is how far it endeavoured to leap.
I like how blood thirsty optimus prime is in this one.
back in the 80s you had Superman, Batman, Terminator, and well Robocp.  Out of all of those movies this one stuck out the most to me till this day. There will never be a movie full of gore, cheese, one liners, and absolute futuristic technology that even today can’t replicate but comes close.  This is not a movie for the light hearted.. its mot a love story.  This movie is about hope.. revenge.. and what a true cop should be.   The scene with Alex Murphy getting shot to death is one of the most painful things I have ever seen.  The unrated version goes a few steps beyond.  Murphy is then dragged away by his partner to the hospital where they have the technology to try and keep him alive as a robot.   Grab some berers, grab some friends, grab something to relax you.. sit back and enjoy what could become today.. could become Now.   Dont watch the remake.. it lacks blood and gore which made this movie what it is today. Also if you dont like this movie.. please unfollow me.. dont need your kind around here
After the travesty that is Revenge of the Fallen, it's quite nice to see Transformers go back to being what it should be about: robots fighting robots. OK, so there's still too much attension paid to the human military characters, but at least this time around the human and Transformer storylines are a lot more woven together, so the movie, whilst still about 30 to 45 minutes too long flows in a way that the first two didn't. Rosie Huntington-Whiteley is an appalling actress, though. Clearly only hired so the film could provide some "eye candy" in the wake of Megan Fox's departure, when really the film doesn't need it at all. There honestly doesn't need to be a romantic subplot in films like this, and if you absolutely must include one, then hire an actual actress with actual acting skills, and not a lingerie model with next to no experience. Overall, Dark of the Moon is too long, very drawn out, and in places slightly boring. It's a damn sight better than Revenge of the Fallen though, which isn't hard to achieve, and actually ends up being a fairly good action flick.
I got to the first thirty minutes and I felt as if I had spent years with these characters. This film is one of the most heart reaching and disturbing films I have seen.
RoboCop is probably my favorite movie. It's a movie I never seem to get tired of. Paul Verhoeven and company saw the direction the world was heading and created a nightmarish dystopian vision of the future that we're basically living in today. With social services gutted and privatized, the media completely useless and inept, everything is sacrificed on the altar of "corporate growth". The future we all wanted was Back to the Future 2, but the future we got was RoboCop.
Stanley sat grinning at his type writer: me so horny...me love you... long time...genius.
Still one of my favorite movies. There are moments where I get goosebumps all over my body.
When I end up having the same problems with the majority of war films, I find it remarkable that this avoids them all. With a beautiful balance, deeply personal story-telling and moments of profound moral enquiry, Kubrick has created the most honest and utterly compelling piece of war fiction of the 80s.
I'm taking tonight to rewatch all the movies I need to for my Film Analysis final paper. I'm so excited to write about this film. I first saw this film at the beginning of high school and liked it, but as I got older and kept rewatching it, I started to pick up on all its deep themes of how fucked industrialization and capitalism can be. Like how did a film called "Robocop" become damn intellectual?! It's just so perfect, never before has a science fiction film been so unique. Not to mention that everything else aesthetically kicks absolute ass. The soundtrack is incredible, the makeup and costuming is so impressive, and for the most part, the visual effects aren't all that dated! Peter Weller just such a fantastic job with his performance as Robocop, especially with all the physically aspects. Every time I rewatch this film, I always find myself walking like Robocop, how does he make such an awkward walk look so badass?! This film is a definite favorite of all time.
Firstly i must say that in this movie the special effects are not boring, they are great. The two previous films made the special effects look so boring compared to this film, but luckily this movie changed the direction of the winds. And the action scenes are more powerful than in the previous films The writing has got better too. It's funny and serious just in the right moments. The acting has got better a little bit, but still it's not at the level it should be. John Malkovich is clearly the funniest part in the movie. And this movie has Frances McDormand in it, WAUH! The cast is great! And i am glad that they got rid off Megan Fox. It's very good to get a little bit the back story of the Autobots and Decepticons. The plot is strong and has higher stakes than in the previous films. As a whole this is the only actual good Transformers movie which gets better and better towards the end (well i haven't seen The Last Knight, but i doubt that it would be better than this film, but miracles can happen, who knows). If you wanna see an actual good Transformers movie go and watch this one if you already haven't.
Because "scumbags see the judge on Monday morning."
The Transformers movies got exponentially worse as they went on. However this one (initially meant to be the last one) kinda goes all out and so batshit crazy that I can’t help but love it.  Here’s just SOME of the crazy shit that happens - the entire moon landing is revealed to be a cover so we can go to the moon and steal some shit from a bunch of dead Transformers. The Autobots break into a nuclear plant in Not-Iran to star spangled freedom all over them. Alan Tudyk goes Bourne Identity on a bunch of Russian mobsters. A Transformers Vulture turns into a pink Bumblebee and brutally murders an entire family including a little girl. Megatron goes to the Lincoln Memorial, blasts apart Abraham Lincoln with a shotgun, and sits in the throne. A giant Transformer worm eats a building. I could go all fucking day, people.  There’s brief moments of inspiration shining through in this movie that shows what a Transformers movie COULD have been in the hands of a competent screenwriter and director. A lot of the Chicago invasion is actually pretty harrowing and brutal stuff, and really feels like this apocalyptic event is happening (even if they had to force in a melodramatic Linkin Park song). There’s a scene where captive autobots are executed that’s genuinely emotional and feels like something out of a war movie. There’s a shocking and surprising plot twist in this movie that I don’t want to spoil because even now it still kinda throws me for a loop. Even Laserbeak killing a family, while totally insane, is also pretty unsettling and helps sell the Decepticons as a real threat.  However for each thing this movie does that I like, there’s at least one thing I don’t. The story (while thankfully SO much simpler than the last movie) is still another Macguffin Hunt with an event from the past being the main catalyst. Frances Macdormand, god bless her for trying her damndest, is still given a lot of goofy lines and not a lot of depth beyond “interfering government agent”, and John Malkovich was just painful to watch. Some of the transformers are given a little more character development, which is nice, but most of them are still just giant robots with accents in place of personalities (those racist twins from the last one are gone though, thank god).  I know for 2 1/2 stars I’m being overly positive. However, like I said, so much bonkers shit happens in this movie and it gives so much effort towards being bigger and crazier that some of what they throw at the wall sticks and leaves a hell of an impact (also yes I’m biased I’ve been a fan of transformers since a kid fuck off). Optimus gets not one, not two, but THREE “kill them all” moments (the first of which he actually says “we will kill them all”), all of which are fucking amazing and still give me chills. Once again, on a technical level these films are undeniably impressive and the work that ILM and especially the Pyrotechnics teams deserves recognition even if these movies aren’t exactly high art. Or low art. Or pop art. Or really art in general (except that scene with Sentinel and Optimus Prime and the Matrix). If you don’t like the transformers movies then this won’t change your mind on them. Maybe one or two scenes will impress you or make think they were lifted from an alternate reality where the transformers movies are critically acclaimed blockbusters. It’s not a great movie. It’s hardly even good. But brief flashes of inspiration do shine through, and between those brief flashes are moments of such drug fueled madness (with a fair share of filler to be fair) that, even if you’re watching this movie to make fun of it (which is a good way to watch it) you will no doubt be entertained.
I will continue to ponder on how the first and second half of the film is connected, but for now I will admire the cinematography (competent tracking shots with the drill sergeant in the center of the frame and handheld chaos in the middle of battle), the duality of man (not only the helmet and peace symbol, but the contrasting tones of humor and death), and the heartbreaking depiction of war (that final shot will stick with me for quite some time).
This movie was soooo much better than I expected it to be. A shitty 80s action movie had no right to be that creative and interesting.
Sporting a suspenseful, thrilling first act that is only hampered in its awe by the succeeding events in Vietnam (save for the final scenes), this is easily the weakest Kubrick film I have seen thus far (and I've seen many). Where the psychological destruction of Pvt. Pyle draws the audience's attention significantly, the occurrences in the war itself seem comparatively dull and average at best. What's more, R. Lee Ermey's performance as the drill instructor supersedes that of anyone in his destructive path, making for character interactions that drive conflict and character development far more so than any lingering piece of...whatever in the second act. The film may have benefitted from being exclusively relegated to the training grounds and expanding the narrative of the first half such that those events would encompass the entire film. There are plenty of other, better stories from Vietnam told in motion pictures (such as Casualties of War), and this isn't one of them.
I lost it in the scene where “E 209” fell, because it wasn’t able to walk down the stairs..
그런데 이렇게 길었어야 했냐. But It really have to be long?
I love this film, don’t get me wrong, Stanley Kubrick is spectacular.  However.  It felt to me like the first half of film and th second half of the film felt like two separate shorter films. The first being about a training process following the story of a young trainee army member with a brutal leader leading to his eventual suicide. And the second: a story in Vietnam of how a journalist views the war scenes and captures the moments that effect the lives of everyone.  They just don’t link... However (again).  I love both parts so so so SO much that I still am rating the film 4.5*s and anyone who follows me is aware I rarely review a film at 5*s. Perhaps Kubrick intended to do this, or perhaps he thought they linked. After all films have many interpretations and readings that I could just have a niche view 🤷🏻‍♀️
I was not high when I watched this movie.
Not my usual type of movie. To be honest I didn't think I was ever going to watch this movie, but the night my brother and I came home from work my dad was watching it and we both just kinda...sat down and watched it with him because why not! We had a cute lil family night and he restarted the movie for us so that we could understand what was happening, and it was pretty darn good. It's not my kind of movie but I can understand why people would like it. That's about all I have to say. The first part was. Very intense. The whole movie is intense really.
I'm watching RoboCop (1987)...the original and the best. I'd buy that for $1 :D
Scared me as a kid back in second grade, showed me how cool cgi was.
Genius! It's not a dramatic war story, but it really moves you...
“That’s it buster, no more foreign aid for you!”
Always amazed at how perfect this is. Seamlessly blending action and satire from the second it begins to the frames right before the credits roll. The very beginning standing as a thesis statement for the rest of the film, the title card appearing seemingly out of nowhere and rolling out with the faux-smiling news anchors accompanied with the always hilarious Verhoeven staple commercials ("Pakistan is threatening my border!" "That's it, buster. No more military aid!") creating the perfect atmosphere for the perfect film. Don't believe me? Just take a look at Kurtwood Smith's straight-faced delivery of, "Can you fly, Bobby?" you'll see why this movie holds up so well.
I'm not a fan of war, but Vietnam has always fascinated me. Full metal jacket is one of the best depictions of the Vietnam war I've ever seen, its going after cacciato meets a clockwork Orange. Utterly beautiful and psychologically thrilling film.
The only Transformers worth watching.
A fantastic dark comedy about political turmoil in the not too distant future of the Detroit area. Robo Cop, the next generation of police force is put to the test to stop all crime, no matter the purpertrator. But what can a single Robot Cop do against the organized crime syndicates that plague the city? Can Robert Crop truly bring justice to the city which hates authority and oozes with corruption?
Maybe worth 5. The apparent lack of continuity in the second half takes away from it a bit but it more or less works to demonstrate Jokers shift from a recruit to a killer.
Gwon megatron (it’s obviously shit)
This might be one of the best '80s film of all time. Its a great action film, but its also a great satire. This film is as much a hybrid as the main character. I always shocks me a story with this ridiculous of a concept can be this good. It is inspiring.
I don't care what anyone says I think the second half is as great as the first half.
I don't know why but I'm mildly obsessed with the final battle in Chicago. The rest I can take or leave.
'Robocop' is an excellent satire on American culture, great action movie, gritty and super violent, it's funny, lots of people get thrown through glass, it's super enjoyable, what's not to love? Everything it sets out to do, it does it exceedingly well. It never takes itself very seriously, but it takes itself seriously enough to never undermine its own intentions. It also does a ridiculously good job of predicting the future - DVD's, GPS, Detroit is a dilapidated shithole, there's an awful sitcom that everybody thinks is great (like 'The Big Bang Theory'), etc. It hits all the right marks.
R. Lee Ermey makes a good war movie absolutely great. During the first half of the movie while the grunts are in training, Ermey gives one of the greatest performances by an actor in a war/military movie in all of movie history. The combat scenes are good but Ermey takes the movie to a whole new level. It comes across as comical, funny as hell, even if that's not what the filmmaker intended. Those sensitive to graphic language and gritty combat scenes will likely not enjoy the movie, but for the rest of us, this is a spectacularly good war movie and one that all fans of the genre should rank near the top of their lists.
Kubrick always has something to say and he says it loud and clear in this one. He balances the content of satirical humor and terrifying conditions very well here and it makes you laugh uneasily. And I think it is way more effective because of just that. It has some fantastic performances here as well, specifically from Matthew Modine and R. Lee Ermey. A good watch. I'd recommend it.
Personally think this one is the best and most memorable but still not the best movie ever. Fun and enjoyable and a little on the darker side in terms of Transformers movies.
There's a strong justification in the creation of the RoboCop in the malfunction of the ED-209 (which, by the way, the stop motion for is the coolest thing about this movie), because it would otherwise make no sense whatsoever. It still never strikes as a good idea, but I buy that these simpleminded, money grubbing company higher-ups would fall for anything in their 80's camp. I love that this future Detroit is just the 80's but it also has RoboCop and the ED-209, and I don't know if this was the idea or if the filmmaker's just didn't feel the need to craft a predictive environment, but it's as if the only attention on technological progression is reserved for weaponry, and the government is so focused on protection that it even grants the corporation power over the police force. That's as much as I can say for the world of this film which means that it's not a great sci-fi movie, the action is dull because hyper-violence doesn't equate brutality which means that it's not a great action movie, so that leaves its strongest facet as the character study. The greatest moment in this is when RoboCop strips his helmet, revealing nothing but the face of Murphy stitched onto a metal frame-- a pretty haunting image that leaves the man as a helpless prisoner trapped inside the machine. He never asked for this and there's nothing he can do to reverse it. The alternative, of course, was death, but you can see in his eyes that even he is unsure if that's preferred.
I don't like war movies and I seem to not like Kubrick's films. I don't see why this has an average 4 star rating? The film has not clear storyline, no comprehensive plot? I was bored to death in the first 30minutes and while it got a bit better, the plot was nothing you could feel with incredibly overrated
Great action movie. Sadly i saw the 2014 Robocop before this one, however I completely forgot about that one. It did taint my view of Robocop before now though. 4/6
I don’t understand why these movies continue to make money. Explosions are fun and all, but this shouldn’t be the standard of filmmaking Hollywood holds itself to.
What I Learned: There should be a sub-genre called 'future propaganda' Direction: ★★★★★ Acting: ★★★★★ Script: ★★★★★ Cinematography: ★★★★★ Sound: ★★★★★ Re-Watchability: ★★★★★ Hails of Bullets: ★★★★★ I Suggest: District 9
Really good movie. Watched it for class and it was interesting.
It’s a minor improvement over revenge of the fallen, it’s at least somewhat watchable and I’ll admit it does have one or two funny moments but I would never recommend this to anybody.
Reason to watch: Peak 80’s action. But also one of the strongest social satires and exploration of humanity and identity. Reason to not: The satire is most evident in the director’s cut, so you gotta go with that one, and it might be a little too graphic for the most squeamish.
All war movies suck, this one the least
Dun der der der derrrr, dun der der derrrr, dun der der der derr derrrrrr. Every time I hear that music with the relentless cow bell it fill me with joy as we must be watching the ultimately quotable, super satirical and hugely exciting cult classic Robocop. This violent Sci-Fi action romp still holds its own today and stands tall as one of my favourite 80's films. It was also the first 18 certificate film I owned on VHS. It has a fantastic and iconic soundtrack and some rather funny news reports and adverts that add a great edge to an already superb film. Although marred with difficulties in production this film is perfect. A brilliant vision. Even with Dick Joneses ridiculously long arms in the final scene it has firmly become one of my favourite films. Violent, visceral and ultimately entertaining. Isn't it time you gave it another go? I'd buy that for a dollar.
Full Metal Jacket is considered a classic and a masterpiece... I get that it's Stanley Kubrick but I feel like The Shining, A Clockwork Orange are better and way stronger and have more Kubrick's style all over those movies I just mentioned. Full Metal Jacket is have a strong first half and 2nd half but goes downhill for me near 3rd act gets little boring and slow I understand why they did it but I got little bored it feels like a different type of film in the 3rd act and also I did not know Vincent D'onofrio was in this film in till I look it up after finished this film the character he plays was unpredictable and kind of cool I guess he become Bug in Men in Black and Kingpin in Daredevil after something happens to his character... (Bad joke I know) That FUCKING BIRD IS THE WORD... Thanks Family Guy for making that song so annoying.. All jokes aside Full Metal Jacket is fun but not perfect and R. Lee Ermey was a lot of fun as well he has lot over the top comments what he says to other soldiers! I did like this movie I would see it again but not for a while it's a decent flick!
Isn't Transformers supposed to be fun? The first one was, and even though the second one went overboard with the toilet humor, it still had its moments. To this movie's, the story is better and more disciplined, though. The first 20 minutes set up an intriguing premise about the "real" reason for the moon landings. Yet it never really follows through with it. After that pre-title sequence it's back to the usual with Sam and company as they try to stop the Decepticons' latest scheme. For what it's worth, Michael Bay reined in some of his baser tendencies. Sam's parents get a whole lot less screen time, and he ditched the racist Autobots from the previous installment. Also, since he shot this in 3D this forced him to tidy up the camera-work and editing. The visual effects also top everything that came before it. There are some really jaw-dropping visuals that looked amazing on a cinema screen, and still looked pretty awesome on my HDTV. On the casting side, he got some more veteran actors to do glorified cameos and add legitimacy to an otherwise mostly talent-starved ensemble. However, Leonard Nimoy as Sentinel Prime was a stroke of genius along with an obligatory Star Trek quote. What didn't work in the film's favor was the tiresome and endless nature of the carnage and destruction. The last hour of the film is basically an extended action sequence, and it was a chore to sit through. The human drama is clichéd at best, insipidly stupid at worst. Michael Bay certainly doubled down on why the films have been so popular, but it seems like he forgot to make it a little more enjoyable. As a result, lengthy stretches of action were rendered boring and depressing. The score didn't help matters much either. Like the previous two, Michael Bay was content to use the kernel of a good idea and slather it with visual effects and mindless action. He knows his audience, to be sure, but his cynicism is on full display here. Transformers 3 corrects some of the more egregious missteps of its predecessor, but it unfortunately loses its soul in the process.
They really don't make movies like this anymore
It's so good I won't even compare the first 40 minutes to the next hour and 10 mins
Great
Absolutely fuckin’ baddass.
i really hate michael bay.
The stories get a little more far fetched but the film itself is better than the the previous one...
So much more than an action movie.
I've seen this before but it still remains my personal favourite of Kubrick's. It's a savage depiction of war and the story is told brilliantly through the eyes of Private "Joker" (Matthew Modine). Modine is excellent as Joker, especially in the latter half as we see him dealing with the emotional consequences of the war. R. Lee Ermey is also memorable as the profane and abusive Gunnery Sergeant Hartman. Vincent D'Onofrio also deserves a mention for his astonishing performance as Leonard "Gomer Pyle" Lawrence. The cinematography is stunning with great use of long takes and extreme close-ups to build tension.
Classic Science thriller which has lost none of its satirical edge or the power to shock and thrill. The music's so iconic too.
The deterioration of civilization and dehumanization of the characters can be seen as Joker comes closer and closer to the realities of war. We see this when Pyle’s psyche falls apart and he kills the instructor, the loss of structure in the group as Animal Mother and Cowboy argue over leadership, Rafterman’s laugh of hysteria after shooting down the teenage sniper. And ultimately, Joker gives the camera his thousand yard stare after killing the girl, showing that, like the rest of the group, he too has become demoralized by the war.
every week I get together with my buddy Chance to talk all things FAST & FURIOUS - the films, the stars, the drama!! the result is a podcast called PODFAST & PODFURIOUS. you'll never guess how we came up with the name. we upload to Soundcloud twice a week and can be found on iTunes/Stitcher with a simple search for Podfast. Minisodes drop on Tuesdays, while full-length Episodes come out every Thursday. we can also be found on twitter @PodfastPodcast in Minisode 28.5 (31:16) we subject ourselves to a supposedly "controversial" episode of the original TRANSFORMERS cartoon and find it to be imperialist propaganda. this is for kids?! plus, we pitch a potential JOHN WICK knockoff about a Jewish Nazi hunter played by Shia LaBeouf. in Episode 29 (1:08:16) it's Tyrese Time as we rip our sleeves off and rave about Michael Bay's instant classic TRANSFORMERS: DARK OF THE MOON. we're talking LaBeouf's mega-acting, Optimus Prime's bloodlust, JFK's invention of ass-eating and so much more. plus Sean Connery, Elon Musk and Mark Wahlberg stop by the show! it's a barn burner!
Man what a ride. The disorientation and insanity of the Vietnam War really shines through with some really great visual storytelling. If I had to quibble with it, the first half an hour completely eclipses the rest of the movie. Yet, having put this movie off for far too long, its gory conclusion was as disturbing as it was memorable.
I took a one week break from the internet and social media. That is why these titles where not logged correctly. I don't like social media. I had to get away. I am now giving myself permission to go back on, but I don't really want to. Now you're caught up.
"Pretty neat."-RoboCop "Stay in touch."-RoboCop "Buddy, I think you're slime"-RoboCop "Your move, creep."-RoboCop "Stay out of trouble"-RoboCop "Come quietly, or there will be...trouble."-RoboCop "They'll fix you, they fix everything."-RoboCop
Full Metal Jacket is the movie that made it possible for Vincent D’Onofrio. To become one of our most reliable character actor.
"... It's not over."  Megan who?
Maybe the most quotable movie I have ever seen.
An incredible film. Two different films in terms of story, the first half and the second half. Connected by the characters and how they shift and navigate this world. The whole film seems to be like this hellish dream world. We know this by the end of the first half and the end of the second half. It’s an incredible war film like I’ve never seen before.
Slightly cooler Transformers=slightly better than Revenge of the Fallen. Not by much. Not that fun to sit through, but you know, I like that building eating worm thingy.
A near prescient depiction of corporate fascism.
There’s a reason why this is in my top four favorite films I’ve ever seen. It’s a powerful and affecting tour de force. What’s awesome about this film is how unlike many other war films, it doesn’t ever feel like a chore to watch.  It’s always disappointing when you realize D’Onofrio has barely showcased his talent in the most recent films he’s done. He’s now almost an annoying actor to watch, which is unfortunate given how much he is capable of.
Flawlesssss!
RLM commentary is pretty epic
Great cinematography but I think the whole "war is bad and we probably shouldn't do it" message is a bit stale and obvious now. The first half was better and should have just been the whole thing.
Flawlesssss!
Kubrick excels in his use of appropriate music to improve a scene, better than Quentin Tarantino even. The confusion of war is well described in this thought-provoking film and the PT scenes were stellar in their attempts to describe the initiation that all military personnel go through. R. Lee Ermey steals the show and lifts it to a higher art form. A must-see for any war movie enthusiast.
RoboCop is the type of film that on first viewing can be marked down as a typical film of the 80s - a simple plot, a bit of action, an unlikely hero and a bleak take on what the future may bring. However, RoboCop is so much more than that. Paul Verhoeven has created his dystopian vision of Detroit and interwoven an entertaining and satirical look on society as a whole. I would put Verhoeven on a pedestal for these types of films which he has repeated through: Total Recall, Starship Troopers and Basic instinct. Ok, I was joking about the last one. Robocop gives us a human look at suffering together with the morality and ethics of what we can and should do with life. But it also makes us laugh in places while being appalled by the over the top tongue in cheek violence. I also love that certain scenes weren’t toned down by a faceless studio exec. This film deserves its 18 rating and is all the better for it. I’d definitely buy that for a dollar. The leads and support play their parts perfectly - Weller and Allen are the straight guys while most of the bad dudes are over the top caricatures of what a bad dude should be. Clarence Boddicker is one of the most despicable characters in film, but you have to love him. And poor Emil - even though he’s a horrible person, I still feel sorry for him... It’s just a shame that the sequels and remake are poor imitations of the original. I love this film but don’t think any review by me could do it justice, so I’ll hand over Robert Lockard @dejareviewer to give us more reasons why everyone should love his film: dejareviewer.com/2014/04/29/cinematic-chiasmus-robocop-is-almost-perfectly-symmetrical-film/
I don't like to admit that this is the last good one but it's totally the last good one.
You'd be hard-pressed to find a better action movie, sci-fi movie, or satirical movie from the 1980's than "Robocop". Is it dated? Yes. Is that a bad thing? Only if you think all movies should look and sound like they were made at the same time by the same kinds of people. Revisiting it for the first time in several years, I was struck by how many things that were meant to be satirical in 1987 -- the cops wearing full body armor and carrying assault weapons, the privatization of a city's police force, those pathetic excuses for newscasts, etc. -- feel like they border on documentary realism in 2018. Sure, I could complain about how the script relies a little too much on the Talkative Badguy confessing his nefarious plans in key moments. But why would I want to waste my time on that kind of reductive thinking when there's so much to admire here? Paul Verhoeven's masterpiece!
94 "I am in a world full of shit, yes. But I am alive. And I'm not afraid." The first act of this film never ceases to leave me speechless, no matter how many times I watch it. Hell, dare I say it has the best first act of any film ever. The whole training camp sequence is nothing short of genius writing and execution on Kubrick's part, at first glance seemingly unnecessary, but the more you look into it the more vital it becomes. The actual war part, while not as eviscerating and enthralling as the amazing training camp act, is pure war action--painful and unbearably frustrating.
Why is this so fucking long
A whole hell of a lot of fun. Pretty smart for an action flick, with some great dystopian future satire and dark humor.
love the use of the kubrick-zoom™️
“Dead or Alive, you’re coming with me!”
at first I thought this was gonna be comedy, but damn I was wrong
It’s perfect for what it set out to do.
definitely in the bottom half of the transformers film franchise, with plot twists that serve to discredit one of the best transformers characters in order to boost the role of another who before this film and the previous cartoon series was a literal nobody? Leonard Nimoy played Galvatron in the original film so anyone who is a fan would have seen the twist coming a mile away. Megatron sucks and sits around, only really getting good in the last minute before he dies but hey at least he gets to recreate the part in the G1 cartoon where he sits on Abe Lincoln's seat? Starscream and Soundwave go out like bitches, Soundwave by one blast through the chest upwards by Bee, Starscream by Sam Witwicky. SAM WITWICKY OF ALL PEOPLE. Also a lot of high grade actors (particularly those with connections to Coen Brothers movies) started showing up. Frances Mcdormand, winner of the best actress award at the 2018 oscars appears, as does John Malkovich and Alan Tudyk and the asian guy from Community and Hangover (I'm sorry I forgot your name, I loved you as Jerry 'Deep' Wang). This isn't a phenomenon linked just to this film, almost every film in the franchise features someone from a higher class of acting. We all know that Anthony Hopkins was in The Last knight but did you also know that The first movie had Jon Voight in it and the fourth one had John Goodman and motherfucking Kelsey Grammer in it. FRASIER WAS THE MAIN HUMAN ANTAGONIST but more on that at a later date. The only exception may be Revenge Of The Fallen since that just reused John Tuturro but I have a sneaking suspicion that there was someone else involved. Hugo Weaving doesnt count since he voiced Megatron throughout the whole first three films. It does however feature some kinda cool moments, like when Optimus plows through the decepticon horde with his jetpack, slowly losing pieces of it and his guns as he makes his way to Shockwave to finish him off with his Knuckle Dusters. Or when The Driller is eating through the skyscraper to reach the N.E.S.T guys and collapses the tower until Optimus saves the day. The fact that the decepticons actually manage to win for a moment and control chicago is cool and a decent enough plot point but the stuff with the pillars is dumb because they can literally recreate cybertron in under a minute but I do like how when it is destroyed, it resembles Unicron slightly since the whole original idea for the first 3 was to set up and use Unicron but now we might not even be getting him which is a shame since he is my third favourite transformer but then again no one can top Orson Welles performance in the G1 movie. The autobots are mostly boring, the only cools ones do nothing except for the minibots Wheelie and Brains, and once again Bumblebee and Optimus do everything. The decepticons are entirely overshadowed by Sentinel Prime despite bringing in a lot of fan favourites and classic characters, making them entirely expendable and redundant. The humans are a mixed bag, Sam Witwicky is dumb but I prefer his emotional connection to Bee over Marky Mark's 'im an inventor'-isms and bad parenting. Carly is only there to fill the void of Megan Fox and she doesn't really do much until the very end? Josh Duhamel and Tyrese are the same as they always are and Dylan Gould is an interesting idea but one that doesn't work very well in execution. Once again, Optimus Prime's ending film speeches are godlike and definitely in the top tier of emotional motivational speeches, I never grow tired of hearing them, his voice is blissful to my ears and the accompanying Lincoln Park song is beautiful since it gives a farewell to the original 3's use of their music at the end, though Torches, the song played at the end of TLK is just a bit more better and socially acceptable in my humble opinion.   "In any war, there are calms between storms. There will be days when we lose faith. Days when our allies turn against us. But the﻿ day will never come that we forsake this planet and it's people."
...no soul brother, too big...
Robocop is a f***ing national treasure.
Amazing first half, brilliant direction by Kubrick leads to a tense dehumanising atmosphere making it so the audience feels the gradual loss of humanity for the characters. Massive drop off however about an hour in after what should have clearly been the climax of the film
Just when I thought it couldn't get any worse than TRANSFORMERS: REVENGE OF THE FALLEN, then comes the third entry in Michael Bay's series. I'm not going to waste my time describing the "story" as it's clear the screenwriters didn't spend more than a minute trying to put something together. The only thing I'll say about the story is that they try to connect our robots to the moon landing in 1969 and claim that Apollo 11 had several secrets. If that sounds interesting to you then it's best just to watch the teaser trailer and leave the rest of the film alone. This introduction only lasts around seven-minutes and then it's back to the brain dead, idiotic, loud and incoherent mess of a movie. It's really shocking that no one has ever tried to come up with a story that you could follow but I guess to Bay as long as you have loud action scenes then nothing really has to make sense. Taking a look at the box office numbers it's clear not too many people object to the horrid mess that this film is. I'm not sure where to even begin but once again I just don't understand the need for a "B" entertainment film to clock in at nearly three hours. It's 154-minutes to be exact but even this is an hour too long. The first thirty-minutes are pure boredom, the next hour has one long, drawn-out dialogue sequence after another and the final thirty-minutes gets to all the action as Chicago is destroyed but by this time I was wishing a real alien invasion would happen and put me out of my misery. This movie is without question one of the worst big-budget movies ever made. The story makes no sense. The comedy is so bad that you can't help but wonder what anyone was thinking. Just take a look at the job interview sequences. Then you have the incredibly stupid parents who are back with even more failed attempts at humor. The performances really aren't any better with Shia LaBeouf really sleepwalking through his part. It's hard to believe that he could have been any more boring as the performance is just downright annoying as is the character. Rose Huntington-Whiteley plays the girlfriend and her performance actually makes Megan Fox look like Meryl Streep. The supporting cast includes John Malkovich, Frances McDormand, Patrick Dempsey, John Turturro and Tyrese Gibson but they too sink in this horrible material. TRANSFORMES: DARK OF THE MOON is just downright bad on all levels. The one saving grace are the wonderful special effects but these aren't enough to save the film.
With the character names you’ve got to think Kubrick was lining himself up to direct the Justice League - Joker, Animal Mother, Eightball, Rafterman, Cowboy, Touchdown, Payback, Crazy Earl. It's like he was made to make an ensemble super hero film.
Every time I watch this movie, I like it even more. The story is depressing because it may as well be set in 2018, but it's funny because it's basically like watching 1987 do an impression of 2018. This is evidence that action movies are perfectly capable of telling an interesting, meaningful story. I guess 'Die Hard' and 'Conan the Barbarian' are in that same category.
Slightly more watchable, due in part to the climax, but still a mess of a movie.
Duality
I've managed to see all of the transformers movies & can't tell any of them apart.
Best Vietnam War movie, I stake my reputation on it.  Maybe not, but like, I wanted to write something dramatic. Sue me.
Hot damn, I don't know how I sat on this one for so long but I'm glad I finally watched it. Not only does it have it's own sense of meta humor but the dialogue is hilarious and fun. "You're gonna be a bad motherfucker!" "Bitches leave." and of course, "Dead or Alive, you're coming with me." So so good. Annoying villains that get absolutely wrecked in satisfying fashion. It does have an ending that's so abrupt that it doesn't conclude the police strike subplot, but the last scene is just almost too badass to care. To my knowledge, the sequels aren't anything special, but I hope to watch them soon.
this movie was so disappointing. the second one is the best and you can't change my mind.
Urm idk if this is it Chief. Interesting commentary on the excessive violence of war but i didnt necessarily feel anything for any of the characters. I know Leonard was meant to be the first casualty of the war but the last half of the film felt very disjointed from its beginning to me. Also I see you Damien Chazelle taking inspiration for Terrence Fletcher I see you. My first Kubrick.
70 Watched: once
All films should end as abruptly as this. There you go, amazing film, bye.
It's Kubrick, that's about all I need to say.
As much as I abhor the politics I am a huge fan of crime exploitation flicks, but at a certain point this one turns it on its head and goes after the people in power in the end.
Actually the dark side of the moon doesn't exist lol
Does for the Mickey Mouse song what A Clockwork Orange does for Singin' in the Rain.
Netflix watch
unfortunately, i watched it.
“He had a dream.” we’re all a product of the machine, now it’s up to us to retain some piece of our identity amidst the corruption and do good.
No joke I found the robot violence in this is disturbingly gruesome.  Some of the decepticon deaths literally resemble liveleak executions. Still in the hospital so this is what everyone in the common area voted on watching. Their shared enjoyment of the whole affair made me sick for humanity.
"Meesa horny."  Any film with this as a line of dialogue should instantly set off alarm bells. But thankfully Full Metal Jacket doesn't go down the same route as a certain other 3 parter. This is a film very clearly made up of 3 acts, or chapters in Joker's journey as a marine; boot camp, life in Vietnam, and all out war. In each the soldier ideology is studied with a different setting and tone. There are a lot of parallels to The Shining to be found, though where that film covers mental deterioration over a short period of time, FMJ takes a longer and more grounded look specifically at the dehumanisation of soldiers.  "If you ladies leave my island, if you survive recruit training, you will be a weapon. You will be a minister of death praying for war. But until that day, you are pukes. You are the lowest form of life on Earth. You are not even human fucking beings."  Joker is the epitome of character progression within a story. As a rookie he must learn to become a cold blooded killer, but not a machine. He can kill all he wants, so long as he keeps his humanity.  "The Marine Corps does not want robots."  In that way the system is full of contradictions. We see more of these when Hartman promotes Joker for his individuality, mistaking it for steadfastness. Instead of stomping it out of him, he lets it fester, encourages it even. This contradiction goes against what a certain recruit and thereby the audience have been fed into believing: there are consequences if you struggle to --or can't-- adapt.  "God has a hard-on for Marines because we kill everything we see! He plays His games, we play ours!"  When Joker is shipped to Vietnam, he's lucky enough to not be involved in any combat, only reporting on it. Through his optimistic outlook, unchanged sense of humour, subtleties in body language and wearing a peace badge, Joker has clearly been sheltered up to this point. He has not committed himself to the war so is passively against it. When a marine from the deep end boasts of counting women and children as confirmed kills, Joker is sickened. But as events transpire and he falls deeper into the thick of it, Joker becomes exactly what horrified him in the first place. His peace badge becomes less and less visible, until, at the crux, it is totally obscured by his jacket collar.  I realise I have just rambled on about a new favourite of mine, but I honestly don't know how else I could do it justice. There's a lot more to talk about here, but I think it's far stronger experienced first hand. Once you've watched it it's really worth looking into, e.g. I didn't even touch on the soundly developed theme of losing innocence, or even Pyle. With so many collaborators in the making of this, Full Metal Jacket proves Stanley Kubrick's mastery of getting exactly what he wants. I'll need to watch it once more before I decide if I can give it 5 stars, but either way it's my favourite Kubrick.
Boy howdy is this movie violent!
I've heard for a long time this was the best Transformers movie. That sounded like faint praise. Okay the whole Chicago battle in the last 30 minutes blew me away. It makes the "good parts" of Pacific Rim look like dog shit and it's a sad reminder of how much Bay no longer cares. The shifting sense of scale and space and the spectacle of destruction is orgasmic. I forgot Bay was ever such a visionary artist. It's such a shame this movie is hilariously too long though. I actually really like all the tasteless appropriation of American history and Andy Daly has a great little part.
Nothing says an 80’s film without over-the-top acting & practical effects.
Dark Of The Moon may very well be the best in the series up to this point (for what it's worth) in terms of its action and effects, especially during the last third. The problem is that dragging an audience through an hour and a half or more of immensely unlikable characters, lame dialogue, confusing story elements, and Bay's typically obnoxious (though somewhat more subdued this time around) direction makes the overall experience an overly long, tedious chore.
Kubrick's most quotable Film. R Lee Ermey is otherworldly. The 2nd half is just as good if not better than the 1st. The Finale is one of the GOAT ones.
Fella gets shot right in his dingus, what’s not to love?
It's almost as if Michael Bay directs some scenes with a boner.  This is a Transformers movie, I don't need the camera ogling the body of your Megan Fox replacement.  Once again this just falls into the trappings of a mindless and uninspired action blockbuster. I still can't fathom how the studio let Bay direct all five. Lastly, what was John Malkovich is in this for? To play someone with a full head of hair? Too say hi to Bumblebee and then disappear for the rest of the movie?
I watched this in my school's computer lab when I was 16 and a buddy looked at me with confusion cause he saw I was watching this and asked me "is it any good?" and I answered yes. This is a good movie.
“ Well listen  chief your company built the fucking thing and now I’ve got to deal with it. I haven’t got time for this bullshit. “
Half of the part is always making me laugh, then the other half is suddenly turn into serious one.
One of the best sci-fi films of all time.
The lame humor of the previous movie is toned down, but this is still a bloated, filler riddled mess. The movie is slow, dull, and drawn out for the first half, then packed with fast cuts and mediocre CGI in the second half. marcfusion.com/2018/07/12/transformers-dark-of-the-moon-2011/

What can I say that hasn't been already said about this film except that it's damn near if not perfect film. A genre classic that has the perfect blend of Cyber Punk Sci/Fi , Action and brilliant Satire with an amazing cast and Paul Verhoeven and Rob Bottin behind the camera it all makes for a true classic.
This film is as good as the CGI JFK they create.
Perhaps it’s because I’m not real into war films or because I expect a large amount from Kubrick, but I didn’t like the film as much as I wanted to. People praise it, but, to me, I only cared about the first 45 minutes and afterwards I checked out. This may be because the structure confuses the messages of the film. I felt that that first half offered an interesting look at the idea that war is hell and how it changes a person. Full Metal Jacket is the movie version of Slaughterhouse Five but I find it hard to glean much more other than what the first half got across. Part of this confusion makes me wonder the origins of the screenplay and concept since it’s the most outwardly violent and explorative of human nature that Kubrick ever got. Although his other films feature violent characters (Alex, A Clockwork Orange; Johnny, The Shining), this one contains violent surroundings with men that aren’t all meant to be violent. I just wished there was more going on other than watching men die in battle and then Joker having to make dehumanizing choices.  Also- can we talk about the score? Of all the people, I didn’t expect a Kubrickian film to use music to set the time frame. It’s still great, but it’s odd.
probably the worst one iv seen so far
Took me way too long to see this. Outstanding war film. Can never go wrong with Kubrick.
Film #48: Film School Drop Outs (2018 Weekly Challenge) Theme: Cyberpunk & Tech Noir Well, this is prescient. I’d probably have nightmares about how terrifyingly familiar this all seems now if it weren’t for the high entertainment value that Verhoeven adds here. RoboCop has that satirical bent to it that makes it rather hard to bang out a solemn analysis of how humanity is doomed due to mass corporatization and the advent of surveillance states. You want to do it, and then you remember the scene where a man drives into a vat of toxic sludge and emerges with his skin melted off. It subverts your desire to bemoan the state of the world because, in the moment, you simply want to cheer on Murphy for retrieving his lost identity so that he can take down the men who so cruelly robbed him of his former life. In fact, there’s an interesting push and pull between disliking the concept of a RoboCop and sympathizing with one, which extends to our present-day ambivalence about policing and its problematic culture. But again, the film tells you not to overtax yourself with contradictory feelings. Your prime directive is to enjoy this adventure for what it’s worth, and then deal with your anxieties at a later time. So who knows, maybe the existential dread will creep up on me by Christmas Eve! As someone who was only peripherally aware of a RoboCop franchise before this, and who is not especially crazy about cyberpunk, this all went down better than expected. Verhoeven’s cheeky use of news bulletins as interstitials was one of his many quirks that raised the film in my estimation, and the graphic violence—while not excessive—helped double down on the story’s tragic elements. It’s quite an interesting coincidence that I watched Bonnie and Clyde before this, because the way they handle their tones is quite similar. Both utilize graphic violence for shock value, but also take a more comic route for scenes of high intensity (like, for instance, when Murphy throws Boddicker through three sheets of glass for no particular reason). The films are about twenty years apart, and yet you can see some of Bonnie and Clyde’s influence (and, in turn, New Hollywood’s influence) on this sci-fi spectacle even now. I also hear there’s a sequel in the works, and I’m already terrified it’s going to be the most self-serious thing imaginable. Verhoeven was really the perfect choice for this film, and anyone who can’t match his level of subversion is going to fall flat on their face. I can tell you that right now.
Transformers: Dark of the Moon. Bayhem Marathon.  “We will kill them all.”  I need a friend like Deutch. 2 things: Michael Bay shot this with regular 35mm film and 3D cameras. Having seen this in 3D when it came out, that was an excellent choice. I also remember him and other actors saying that he wanted this ending to be like Black Hawk Down. Something more geographic and have the feel of a war drama. Overall, I think Bay succeeded. There’s still some issues I have with this film. The first half kept my interest, but it was more on the boring than I remember it being. There’s an actual plot in this film, but the whole moon landing stuff doesn’t have that big of an effect as it’s set out to do. Rosie Huntington-Whiteley was very good in Mad Max: Fury Road, but in this film, she’s so hallow. I’m glad she got better because she had no purpose in this film. That’s another thing, there’s several characters who don’t serve any real purpose except to move the plot along, maybe. NOT ENOUGH John Turturro! Patrick Dempsey’s character is a really terrible character and should not be in this film. Also, this might have one of the most abrupt endings of any film that I’ve seen. HOLY CRAP! So, this isn’t a spoiler, the good guys win. They literally leave Chicago in ruins when the Auotbots finally win. Optimus Prime narrates over for maybe 2 sentences and then the film cuts to black. WHAT?! I just wasn’t ready for it to end like that. I thought they’d be a bit more. Like montaging how they’re going to fix the city or work with the US government again and gain their trust back. NOPE! It’s just over. So yeah, wasn’t ready for that. That being said, there’s a lot of great stuff in this film. The first half of this film is a little boring, the other half is batshit awesome! I’m not kidding. For like a straight hour or so it’s nothing but destruction, action, firework explosions, and mayhem! I LOVED IT! It’s exactly what Michael Bay promised. It might possibly be BAYHEM at its finest. CGI, sound design, practical effects, sound effects, and making a film feel larger than life is something Michael Bay does very well. Mad Max: Fury Road will always be my favorite action film, but Michael Bay is certainly the king of action movies. Shia LaBeouf is actually really good in this. Seriously, I really felt for his character at times (the only critic is that his character should have died several chaotic moments). Ken Jeong has one small part in this film. While some find it unnecessary, I always find enjoyment in his little cameo. It’s over-the-top, and I love it. Our new Director of Photography is Amir Mokri. I have to say, he captures the film’s battle sequences very well. There’s so much color but also still shows the gritty action all happening. He did a fantastic job of making the film look good. There’s still a few moments of stupidity throughout the film. Patrick Dempsey and his stupid crusade. Megatron is pretty useless in this. The character Sam is now some expert in parkour and being a badass all of a sudden. Which is strange since a few years ago, he was just in high school. It just doesn’t make since to me for his character. Overall, the first half has a few too many exposition scenes. It’s interesting, but not the most exciting. The second half takes off and never stops until the end. The first film is still the best in my opinion. That being said, this film has the best action of the Transformers Franchise. I really enjoyed it. Fuck the haters. 8.7/10 (A-/A).
traditional anti-war films start with men before dehumanisation - introducing them full of heart, and then eroding it in combat. full metal jacket reverses this arc. identities are stripped away in the opening, while later we see laughter, comradeship and levity. usually normality is framed as a relief, because no matter how bad war is, humans are good, but kubrick challenges this. humans aren't fundamentally good. we shouldn't breathe easy, because dehumanisation takes seconds. the things we associate with resilience and stoicism become brutal insensibility, which is in itself a horror of war.
Cheesy, over the top and great fun, RoboCop is a great 80’s action flick. With a good story and surprisingly good twists, RoboCop is a masterpiece compared to its PG-13 remake. Slightly confused on why criminals would keep shooting at him though.
I will always be upset that I spent money to see this movie. It's just fucking terrible.
It's amazing how despite how much has been based on this it still works and feels powerful and fresh from the opening scene on through. Those first 45 minutes are especially stunning and some of the best I've seen.
Masterfully made action film that’s the antithesis of the 70/80’s vigilante films. It skewers everything from capitalism, corporate interest in public trust, mass media, body image and gun control. It’s a very sharp screenplay and visually astonishing. The sad part is that’s is more relevant now then when it was made. An absolute genre masterpiece.
There are script issues to be sure but this is a gorgeous, visceral experience that remains one of 3D's greatest accomplishments; the format made Bay evolve just as Bay made 3D evolve. While I may hold other of his films more closely to my heart I feel confident in saying this film as a whole is Bay's finest achievement.
If you ever wanna know where most of the earliest references came from..
Being as the first movie I ever remember seeing is the Blues Brothers, the '80s gritty city on display and lived-in feel of the sets put me right at home. There's a lot of little things like that I like in this movie. The Godzilla like animation of the ED-200, Bob being the kid with the coolest toy at school, Red Foreman looking cocky and dangerous, the wood-paneled precinct, the ensemble acting. I'm not sure how much I like the whole, but all these touches make it a lot of fun to watch.
R. Lee Ermey gives the greatest performance in movie history. The rest of the amazing but he steals the show. Or at least the first half of the show. It is really two films in one. The boot camp first half and the second during the Tet Offensive. Both find a way to be thoroughly entertaining, intense, satirical and somehow funny. Of all the Vietnam movie's of the mid to late 80's this is the best.
The third live-action outing for the robots in disguise is, in a rather surprising turn of events, actually the best of the lot. In fact, I’d go so far as to say that it’s almost a perfect modern popcorn flick with only one or two major failings. The first major failing is the overlong runtime (this clocks in at just over two and a half hours) and the second is, although I hate to seem so cruel, Rosie Huntington-Whiteley. People may enjoy criticising Megan Fox but seeing her replacement may end up prompting many to think that she wasn’t all that bad, actually. So, ummm, what’s the plot of this one? Well, it’s actually not all that bad but I don’t want to give anything away so I’ll just say that it involves the space program, a very powerful device that could win or lose the ongoing battle the Autobots are having with the Decepticons, Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf once more) trying to adjust to his new job and reel after reel of impressive, jaw-dropping, action. Like the two movies before it, this film has flaws (and it’s not going to convert those who enjoy despising Michael Bay) but it gets a hell of a lot right and does a lot to make up for the mis-steps of the second film. Love or hate his style, there are moments here that are so epic in scale and so mind-bogglingly complex and packed full of action that you can’t help but admire Bay for his ability to cope with the sheer logistics of such sequences. There is still a feeling of a bit too much being thrown onscreen every few moments but it’s so damn entertaining that nothing depicted ends up feeling like it’s just a pointless flourish. While it’s not like me to disagree with everyone else (ahem!), I’d just have to say that I actually thought the opening moments were amongst the weakest in the film. Recreating the time and events of the space race and putting a Transformers-shaped stamp on them seemed like a great idea, and made for a very exciting trailer, but the faked footage just feels exactly like, funnily enough, faked footage. The story strand it leads into and develops is great but those early scenes remained at their most effective when only glimpsed in trailer form. The action is the biggest draw here but, occasionally, the humour isn’t as bad as it could be. It still doesn’t work, for the most part, but there’s less of it shoehorned in amongst the big battles and the jealousy that Sam feels for his girlfriend’s boss (Patrick Dempsey) is actually mildly amusing. The rest of the comedy, while lame, is at least provided by a number of great names bravely shedding some dignity for the sake of simple entertainment. Ken Jeong has one or two scenes, John Malkovich raises a few smiles, Patrick Dempsey is fun, Alan Tudyk is as fantastic as he always is, John Turturro gets some better material to work with this time round and Frances McDormand makes a great, stern, figure of authority. Kevin Dunn and Julie White get even less time onscreen in this outing but that makes their “comedy schtick” easier to stomach. Josh Duhamel and Tyrese Gibson return in time to kick ass during the second half of the movie and Rose Huntington-Whiteley is, well, terrible. Maybe terrible isn’t the right word. Maybe I should say atrocious or wooden or vapid. But let’s move on. The vocal cast includes Hugo Weaving and Peter Cullen once again but also benefits immensely from the inclusion of Leonard Nimoy. Ehren Kruger provides a decent enough script, with a bit more going on than we had in the first two movies, and Bay directs it with his usual bombastic style. The FX work is pretty damn impressive throughout and it’s easy to just sit back and enjoy the spectacle even when things get a little bit confusing (the manoeuvres performed by the soldiers are quite gung-ho, surprise surprise, and the location of characters during the finale isn’t all that easy to keep up with). It might not completely wipe out the memory of the disappointing “Revenge Of The Fallen” but it certainly tries hard and ends this particular trilogy on a high.
Kinda great, kinda shit. I knew there'd be a bit of 80's style action induced gore but wasn't expecting some of that to have a kind of body horror vibe about it. Those special effects are mainly rad and as daft as it looks i like the stop motion mega bot type thing. Neat. Robocop himself when he takes off that helmet looks so good, right? Also, I'm convinced Lynch cast Ray Wise after seeing him facially emote in this movie. Couple of Leland esque screamy laugh things in there too. When I clocked that this was directed by the dude that directed Total Recall, everything kinda made sense. And when I seen Red Foreman pop up I knew someone was gonna end up with a foot in their ass.
Transformers Dark Of The moon The Fuck
Red Forman SNAPPED here
Two films in one, Full Metal Jacket must be the definitive war film. Covering the basic training to mission completion, the senseless of the fight, the dehumanising changes to personality, and even the quiet times - the scope of this feature feels epic.
Transformers: Dark Side of the Ass wouldn’t have been an anymore better title but it would’ve gotten comedy points.
incredible blend of action and comedy
Another perfect film. Kubrick's work is just dripping with meaning and metaphor. There are many reasons why this is my favorite war movie, but I guess, more than anything, it doesn't stay focused on any one theme for too long. A lot of people focus on the first half because of the super dark ending, but some really heavy parts pass by in one or two quick lines like, "How can you shoot woman and children?" and the gunner's response of, "Easy! You just don't lead them so much. War's hell, ain't it?" There are tons of little moments like this that other directors devote entire films to (the sociopolitical impacts of having the press cover the war and the way they do it, how Joker, displaying the duality of man, commits his first kill in an act of mercy, etc.). The more I watch this, I begin to think the second half may actually be the stronger half, especially when comparing to other Vietnam movies like Platoon and Apocalypse Now. This film doesn't overmoralize. There are no simple answers. I think one of the most glaring themes I see every time I watch this is the strength of the team over the individual. As certain people are added or are removed from the collective group, the group survives. The drill instructor basically outright says this at one point, referring to the Marine Corps, and it holds true throughout. It's hard not to see, for example, the parallels in Animal Mother and Private Pyle. The two end up having completely opposite outcomes. It doesn't even really matter the makeup of the group or the words in the marches, just that they do them as a single unit, as seen in the final shot. Perhaps most notably, the actor who plays Joker is also in The Dark Knight Rises?! WHAT ARE THE ODDS?!
This was a solid if decent enough effort. For the most part, the new focused center on the couple isn't all that great since it does tend to go on way too much without the same feeling or realism that they conveyed in the other two. It's all too coincidentally and just there to move the story along which is quite nicely handled here. The action works well, the sense of dread is a lot more prevalent before the twist needed to keep them around which kinda caught me off-guard so their reappearance at the end is quite thrilling and exciting. The battles do have a lot grander sense of finality to them than the others films' so I wouldn't have minded that this does end the franchise actually since it seems to wrap up everything quite well. It does feel a little weaker but there's still a lot of fun to have here.
The first 45 minutes could stand alone as one of the greatest (short?) films ever made. The last hour plus is well crafted and well acted, but it just doesn't bring anything interesting to the table that we haven't seen time and time again.
Overlong, poorly written and filled with Bay-isms. Still has an incredible score though and the battle for Chicago is some damn fine action filmmaking.
“This is my rifle. There are many like it but this one is mine. My rifle is my best friend. It is my life. I must master it as I must master my life. Without me, my rifle is useless. Without my rifle I am useless. I must fire my rifle true. I must shoot straighter than my enemy, who is trying to kill me. I must shoot him before he shoots me. I will. Before God I swear this creed: my rifle and myself are defenders of my country, we are the masters of my enemy, we are the saviors of my life. So be it, until there is no enemy, but peace. Amen.”
Good special effects for people being shot and shit
Transformers: Dark of the Moon is far better than Revenge of the Fallen, but is still a bad movie. The action is fine, the humans are terribly written, and the film is far too long.
Full Metal Jacket is one of Kubrick's best.
I fell asleep during the 3rd act, that really says something about my opinion on this film. :-/
The best Transformers movie, hands down don't @ me.
How many movies should one watch before they finally give up on trying to like Kubrick? To be fair, this was the least bad so far
That’s it buster! No more military aid!
Business-as-usual here for this third go around. Bay’s style of “film-making” doesn’t change, he is the master of frivolity and Transformers is peak trash. There are more slow-mo action scenes with explosions bigger than a small country here, certainly more than any person without some for M of attention deficit disorder could conjure, so you'll know where you stand with this.  At 2.5+ hours its a long stretch for the uninitiated, but Bay knows how to pull out all the stops to give the viewer a visceral, mind-altering cinema experience with plenty of cheese dolloped on top. File directly under guilty pleasure.
This film is almost two completely different films; the first half is all about the training side of it and shows more of the psychological side of it all with what the soldiers are thinking and feeling and allows us to delve into the darker depths of their minds. The second half is a pure war film with the characters now in Vietnam and actually experiencing the harsh realities of war and, as well as giving us awesome battle sequences, once again shows us a more psychological side with how the characters can deal with war. The performances in this film are fantastic and realistic; you would almost believe these characters were real people being documented. The cinematography and editing is great as it only adds to the tension of the film. The script is great as well but also the improvised dialogue at the beginning added a touch of realism but also made the film that little bit more frightening and intense. Overall, this is a really great bit of cinema. The first half of this film provides an excellent build-up and the second half is an incredible payoff. Score: 88/100
Possibly the best 2 quid I spent on a movie, excellent concept, violence and a very original sci fi film
One of the greatest action movies of all time. Robocop has everything. Great plot, great characters, great effects, ultra-violence and a healthy dose of comedy and satire. There are so many memorable moments. The crazy opening, the introduction of ED209 and toxic waste man being personal favourites. The news segments are also great; something I couldn't fully appreciate when I was younger. Robocop is amazing. Watch it.
Contrary to most people, I actually prefer the second half of this movie. While yes, the drill sgt. has great lines, the boot camps scenes are a disturbing look into how they really had to make young men ready to kill. The second half then shows the disturbing, heartbreaking realities of war. This glamorous picture of war is shattered in front of our eyes, and the characters realize, as many real young men did in Vietnam, that war is hell. This may be the film that has emotionally effected me the most.
It's a bit dumb but I had a blast. Best movie in the franchise,an epic conclusion of the trilogy. This should've been the end so we wouldn't have got a mediocre T4 or a shitty T5. 8.5/10
Can’t beat some 80’s cheese
“You look like the best part of you ran down the crack of your momma’s ass and ended up as a brown stain on the mattress.”  A traumatic and brutal look at the dehumanization of soliders from boot camp to the war itself. He covers so much throughout, some may find parts more enthralling then others, but i loved it all in its entirety. Kubrick being a perfectionist makes his films so easy to gaze at even if you aren’t completely hooked. His visuals are so raw and effective, which make this one of the best looking films I’ve ever seen. His use of wide angles, long takes, and zooms make for some incredible tension. No music adds to that as well. Just smoke and flames, gunshots and bloodshed. R. Lee Ermey gives one of my all time favorite performances here.
Why did I choose to rewatch this piece of crap? Well I've been rewatching all of RedLetterMedia's reviews and this was a movie they reviewed. So I decided to refresh my memory of it. What a mistake that was. At two and a half hours long, this movie is endlessly boring with the final hour of the film being the final action sequence. There's no real character development past Shia LaBeouf wanting to be recognized for saving the world in previous films. Nothing really happens in the first half of the movie. There are some so-called funny scenes with John Malkovich, John Turturro, and Ken Jeong. But I didn't laugh. Most of these characters are dropped by second half. Leonard Nimoy voices a new robot to class the joint up, but he can't. The CGI is endless and crappy. Patrick Dempsey is entirely unbelievable as a villain character. Petter Cullen says vague nonsense. And then the movie hard cuts to credits. What? I've wasted enough words on this. Michael Bay just needs to stop making these. It begins at 1448/1487 Dark of the Moon < Galaxy Quest Dark of the Moon < Because of Winn-Dixie Dark of the Moon < Sisters Dark of the Moon < The Amazing Spider-Man 2 Dark of the Moon > Breaking In Dark of the Moon < The Watch Dark of the Moon < Agent Cody Banks Dark of the Moon < Baywatch Dark of the Moon > The Santa Clause 3: The Escape Clause Dark of the Moon > Let's Be Cops Dark of the Moon < Daddy Day Care It rises to 1437/1487. Yay....?
In 1987, Paul Verhoeven gave us a sci-fi/superhero action film set in a dystopian future (2043 to be exact) but added in a sociopolitical messages and satire that showed it was a film of not only brawn but brains. Robocop himself was inspired by Space Sheriff Gavan, the six million dollar man, Rom: Spaceknight, Iron Man and Judge Dredd. The story is relatively simple, telling of police officer Alex J Murphy who is critically wounded/nearly dead after his first assignment as part of the Detroit police force. Omni Consumer Products (OCP) has entered a deal with Detroit's government to try and clean up the city of crime, and they choose to ressurect Murphy as the cyborg Robocop. There's tons of great ultraviolent fight scenes with Robocop, and the fact that robocop has an extra mechanical device where his middle finger should be. Murphy lacks a lot of his original memories but slowly regains them as becomes more human once again. Unfortunately, Robocop's designer, Robert "Bob" Morton, is killed by OCP's Senior Vice President Richard "Dick" Jones, who wanted his giant robot ED-209 to be the police and military tool of choice. Robocop tries to arrest Dick but can't as his 4th "[Classified]" directive is Any attempt to arrest a senior OCP employee results in shutdown. Fortunately, the Old man CEO fires Dick after Robocop shows them a video of Dick confessing to Bob's murder. The Old Man thanks RoboCop for his good shooting and then asks what his name is; RoboCop smiles, removes his helmet and answers, "Murphy", showing his regained humanity. Robocop is a lot of fun and also has a serious message at heart, about the difficulties the police face as well as media influence, gentrification, corruption, authoritarianism, greed, privatization, capitalism, identity, and human nature. The parody commercials are hilarious (although I feel Nuke'm may seem superfluous if you know there is a card game called Nuclear War and its expansion/spin-off Nuclear Escalation, both of which were out at the time). The special effects are still good and hold up today. An 80s classic that still holds up today.

Exciting that 70s show spin off where Eric's dad hustles hard on the side which makes you wonder why they're always freaking out about money and he's always calling Eric a dumbass instead of just thrusting a shotgun into his piddly little face and bellowing BITCHES LEAVE whenever Kelso and Hyde come over
this was so perfectly filmed with perfect lighting....perfect camerawork the continuous shots wow
I’ve come to the conclusion that this is peak Michael Bay and is his only truly great film. It’s the full culmination of what he views as action through a cinematic language. For a while I thought most of the praise for this film on here was just ironic and for some people I still believe their enjoyment of it comes off insincere, but I think I’ve finally zoned in on what makes this work.
An 80's classic that don't get less enjoyable and fun over the years. Dope fun any time.
The first half of the movie is such a masterpiece that I feel like it makes the other half of the film mute. The movie feels like a double feature every time I watch it. I by no means think that the second half of the movie is bad. it's actually really good. It's just not the masterpiece of the first half.
Transformers: Dark of the Moon is actually a solid entry in the series. The story is still a mess but is way better than the previous. The human characters are not as boring but are still kind of annoying. The writing is also still pretty bad. The visual effects look amazing though. In the end, this isn't a perfect movie but it's entertaining.
Doing a watch through of Verhoeven. I have a copy of Elle waiting to be watched, but I also got a blu of this over the weekend and it was only right for me to watch it again. The best action movie, the best Verhoeven, the best everything.
Here's my 2000th movie on Letterboxd I'm sure I've seen more than 2,000 movie overall ,i just can't remember them . And yes ,It was what I expected "Dope"
this was a fun 80s cocaine fueled schlock fest and i enjoyed every minute of it
This one I actually like cause it has pretty good characters that hold the story together.  With Explosions and Explosions and Explosions!
I propose a Robocop drinking game. Take a shot everytime somebody goes through a window/glass door. You will be fucking trashed by the end. Also, I miss 1980s action films where there is violence, blood, corporate bad guys and toxic waste.
Really strong action direction, consistently funny Loved the classic old-school baddies Great one liners Iconic props, fucking love good props the 3000 SUX or whatever, very nice
damn this a good movie and its like split into 2 films. The first part of this film is about a retarded guy whos name i cant even remember but he is like a retard in the military (redundant i know) and like i guess the sergeant is a dumb asshole who is trying to make these young men tough. So during america's illegal war in vietnam the US was just sending every young boy across the world to go and die for communism or something and apparently retards were allowed to die for this cause as well (may God have mercy on our souls) and this retard, private pyle is antagonized for about 45 minutes straight by his sergeant. It actually gets boring after 10 minutes but i guess like boomers love it because pussy millennials dont understand heard work or something i dont fucking know anymore tbh. along the way pyle is befriended by this white guy called "Joker" and joker is like an anti war guy or something but like he's cool to private pyle and he helps pyle the best he can i guess. Pyle is bullied by everyone at camp and one night they even beat the shit out of him while he's asleep and im sorry but i laughed when private pyle cried. Anyways pyle is driven to insanity and one night while everyone is asleep, like a dumb asshole he is reciting military war hymns or something and it catches the attention of joker who is on night duty. Pyle is in the bathroom just looking scary as fuck holding a loaded weapon and the sergeant nigga wakes up and asks what is going on but because the sergeant is a stupid fuck he has zero clue how to deescalate the slaughter thats about to happen and he just insults the retarded man with loaded weapon. Pyle shoots the sergeant in the chest and the kills himself and the first half of the film ends. The second part is actually better than the first and it made me want to go beat up chinese (vietnam people) yea so joker is the main character i guess and now hes in vietnam and im actually tired of writing so pretty much theres a few cool characters and the black guy dies but they kill some vietnam girl and its just kinda sad because what was the vietnam war even about? Oil, anime, racism?? who knows my guy. ANyways war is fucked and i dont think anyone really enjoys that shit. I have seen so many people die in front of me and it's just as crazy the 25th time as it was the first.
"Avengers," but it's worse. This movie has a bad script, screw the acting, suprisingly, I like the score, and the CGI is still better than modern MCU films, which look like older videogames. Man, I am running out of things to say for these reviews.
I still can't believe how perfect this movie is. I wish Ed Neumeier, Michael Miner, and Paul Verhoeven would get together again for a note-perfect prognostication of the future because this one's now out of date -- uncannily prescient for more than 20 years into the future, but we now have an even more unpredictable dystopia ahead of us. What will 2038 hold? I don't know. I'm sure it'll be godawful. I could talk (and have talked) at greater length about this gem, but instead I'll just say that this movie makes me sympathize and root for a totally sociopathic corporate executive (Bob Morton as played by the incredible late Miguel Ferrer) and our boy Alex Murphy (Peter Weller), a cop who crosses the picket line.
R. Lee Ermey is always the best thing in ever movie he's in!
Weakest Kubrick I've seen yet, but it's Kubrick, so it's still pretty good. The first half was better and had more character than the Vietnam scenes, which were slow, didn't really go anywhere, but were at least shot really well. Great usage of contemporary music.

I’d buy that for a dollar
duality of man i guess
this make no sense to me
This just might be the most 80s action movie to have ever 80s action movied. I recently introduced myself to Paul Verhoeven's work with his recent venture, Elle, but this was so extraordinarily different that it's quite frankly absurd. Usually one can detect some general technical/narrative connections in a director's oeuvre, but where Elle is a slow paced, starkly realistic character study, RoboCop is a bloody, cheesy, piece of entertainment that fit perfectly into the cultural zeitgeist of its time. It's funny how good this movie is without having any real good performances, except for Kurtwood Smith as the brutally evil Clarence Boddicker. Peter Weller was fine in the leading role, but was offered very little character development other than the fact that he had a wife and son. Joel Kinnaman's portrayal in the 2014 remake was much more impressive on this front. Everyone else from plucky cops led by an angry black captain to some generic goons were pretty by the numbers. This film's strength is twofold, it's screenplay and its production. The dystopian Detroit seen in this film is excellently realised, with all the sets feeling perfectly grimy and lived in. On a budget of $13 million, it's immensely impressive, from the makeup and costumes to the stopmotion robots. It's level of violence and blood-squibs is almost parodic, and make for incredibly entertaining action cinema. When I saw the Robocop remake, I was surprised to see the blatant political undertones. I believed that it was just trying to be relevant, and had no idea that the original was, in addition to being a balls-to-the-wall action film, a damning social critique. This film was written by Edward Neumeier and Michael Miner, and their screenplay is an effective reflection of the Cold War era, satirising the military industrial complex, consumerism, social decay and much more. It has all the rage and scorn behind it of a young generation seeing where society is potentially headed and while it can be a little on the nose from time to time, it never interfered with its impact. I enjoyed this far more than I was expecting to, and will definitely seek it out on home video. It's a brilliant capturing of a time, both in the film industry and in the real world, subtextually.
This is one of my dads faves and we tend to agree on movies however we had vastly different reactions: he could quote every scene from it and enjoyed it since the 80s I flinched at the verbal abuse and the way the Vietnam war affected each of the men In conclusion: war! a mess!
RoboCop does not pass the Bechdel Test :/
I never thought I would say this but I missed Megan Fox while watching this. The upside is Sam’s parents are as great as ever. The action in this movie is as good as you would expect from a Transformers movie. Sadly, that means mind bending CGI, lens flares and cameras moving so fast you can’t tell what is happening in an effort to shield you from the CGI madness.
well... there was a robo and a cop
I'm starting to think war is bad, guys.
This is the last Transformers movie that I can still follow despite its plot holes. I failed to understand what happened next.
Hm, yes... the real enemy is toxic masculinity.
Optimus Primes saves the day part three. Bye Megan.
Thoughts: 1. Robocop fucking bangs 2. It’s interesting how this film mirrors the rhythms and tone of the great cyberpunk animes coming out of Japan at the same time. 3. This becomes more and more like a documentary every passing year 4. Robocop fucking BANGS
Maybe it was because I was visiting Chicago for the first time when they filmed this one, but there is definitely a nostalgic lens on this third installment for me. Surprisingly, the filmmakers did much better in almost every fashion. Megan Fox leaving the franchise didn't hurt the trilogy whatsoever and the action sequences actually felt intense and more focused. Honestly, the actors are the worst part of this movie for me. The main character Sam is still obnoxious and simply screams too much. The writing improved, but was not deemed great because of the direction. However, the visual effects are still quite impressive and the new additions were much more noticeable this go around. Overall, it's a fun blockbuster that I can still enjoy at times. Let's be honest, they did the Avengers effects before that movie even did. Worth a rental or casual viewing. I watched this movie on Blu-ray disc.
People dog on the second half of this movie. Not only is it great, it might be my favorite half of the film.
I truly felt like a worse human being after watching this.
when stanley kubrick made the best possible use of the handheld / shaky cam i felt that
What a fucking movie
Watch this to hear family guy jokes and gear sound effects
Kubrick’s attempt at a war film gives you two films for the price of one. The first hour is an intense and occasionally funny montage of marines in training, culminating in the most disturbing way.  The second part is more traditional in bringing you into the fighting. Although this bit doesn’t quite live up to the first part, Full Metal Jacket is still an interesting take on Vietnam from a refreshing angle. And typically Kubrick.
RoboCop is the action movie equivalent of a really good, prescient Onion article; it strikes an undeniable nerve and speaks directly to the heart of our culture. Also, it seems more real and relevant than it should. The movie just doesn't seem to age. No matter the time in my own personal life, or the culture I find myself in the midst of, the deep, pointed satire about consumerism, corporate culture, and the brutality in which those things operate, always seems to hit home. It's such a perfect meeting of artists: Paul Verhoeven is firing on all cylinders, Ed Neumeier's script is the perfect canvas, the suit transcends the medium and takes on a pop-myth quality, and Peter Weller gives a truly incredible and idiosyncratic performance. And I haven't even mentioned some of the amazing effects work, that not only set an industry standard for the time but also (mostly) holds up incredibly well. I mean, the chemically melted thug is as gruesome as it has ever been. I could go on and on about this one, but I'll just leave it here for now. God damn, is RoboCop a good time, this is definitely true, but it never settles for being just an "entertaining" piece of cinematic ephemera. Modern genre filmmakers should take note.
2nd rewatch and I still can't decide if this is a 1/2 star or 5 star film. So for now I'll just stick with 2 1/2. Stay tuned though...
Let me see you warface!
I just... why did they have to do my man Shockwave like that?
I finally did it and I’m starting to see why so many people love Kubrick. Not only is this film a great critique on Toxic Masculinity, Overblown Patriotism and War, it also functions as a Black Comedy.  It has excellent performances, especially from R.Lee Ermey and Vincent D’Onofrio. It’s shot spectacularly with great usage of long takes that really make you feel out the environment. And it’s about 10x better than Apocalypse Now. 1 down many more to go, let’s see what you’ve got Kubrick.
Watched on Hulu (with Mom).
One of Kubrick's s@#tiest films. Right?
It's hard to separate myself from my younger self and the love I felt for it at the time, but I can't help but have a great time every time I watch this movie.
Now this is a really crazy realistic war movie the kind that make you crazy about go to war.
The most coherent and least obnoxious sequel to the original
Mostly holds up despite all the satire about the state of television ads, entertainment, and privatization being very nearly modern reality. Still a lot of fun, and has great performances all around.
I mean... it's all there.
Another battle between the Autobots and Decepticons and humanity and saving the world from destruction! Another Michael Bay fun action popcorn flick!!
Stanley Kubrick's penultimate film shows him still at the top of his game, with some of the finest cinematography in his oeuvre. Sure, everyone knows the first 45 minutes, with R. Lee Ermey's iconic performance (Improvised, at that! A rarity when it comes to Kubrick's filmography, with only Ermey and Malcolm McDowell in Clockwork being the only exceptions) and Vincent D'Onofrio's memorable nervous breakdown. However, the rest of the film, especially that final firefight, serves as some of Kubrick's more underrated work. The man's a damn genius.
I have no idea why I had never seen this movie before, but I can see why it's so acclaimed. It's violent and clever, but it's still able to create great characters. The villains are great and intimidating and the theme is still stuck in my head. I loved it
I still like this one, I don't care what anyone says.
Powerful film!
Great movie, it was gruesome in quite a few scenes but it never qualifies for gore. Robocop definitely has resting zack face take a picture of zack and you will see it too. It was a great movie, no one could figure out to shoot him in the mouth or visor though which was kind of infuriating though. I would definitely watch this movie again because it was great.
It seems as though each subsequent film in the series becomes more of a spectacle, and equally more preposterous, but both tend to balance each other out. The Transformers themselves are still visually unappealing, barely distinguishable from one another, don't mesh well with their surroundings, and are generally not particularly believable. The actors tend to be just as bad, with Shia LeBeouf shrieking hysterically, John Turturro being generally unlikable, and everyone else completely forgettable. But, oh, the spectacle! I can't say that watching all the FX carnage isn't some kind of fun. From the car chases, to the ridiculous building collapse, to the one-on-one robot swordfights (really?), the cartoon mayhem is way over the top, and even jumps the rails by adding "blood" sprays to mechanical wounds. I found I didn't particularly care much about the plot - something involving Leonard Nimoy bringing Cybertron to Earth - but the flailing gears, cameos, and Easter eggs were thrown so fast and furious that I hardly noticed I'd lost over two and a half hours of my day.
No fun until Robocop shows up, which fortunately isn't long, then it's a lot of fun. Also love how the film is just one giant shat on Reagan's Star Wars program. Great score too.
The older I've gotten the less I like this film, but that bit with the dying guy in the middle of the street is amazing.
I completely jumped the boring part. I just wanted to watch action and explosions. The "ignorant" part, to be clearer. Well. I have to admit that I was bored of it after 20 minutes, and I found myself wondering where was the difference between Transformers 3 and The Avengers. Actually, there is no much difference, both in intents and style. But one is spectacularly well done, entertaining and manages to be liked when you are watching it, while the other one is not, and the only thing you would like to do is switch your television off. This is the typical sequel that doesn't say anything, that has completely lost all the verve that was present in the first chapter, just made to gain some more money. From a "hey, unlike me I'm a nerd" movie became a "woo, look how cool I am!" movie. The "best" thing is that they are going to make a Transformers 4 and, Gods be mercyful, also a Transformers 5!
A classic ahead of its time. ✊🏻
the first bit with r lee ermy is the best part of the movie
Transformers 3 is the worst movie to have reached the 1 billion dollar gross mark in the history of films. I can't believe people enjoyed that stuff.Literal wads of hot garbage flying around in the air, with no clear idea of where they’re going. Nothing against Shia Labeouf, but man I really wished he would play a role that actually accentuates his talents. Ali’s Rating: C
War is hell and causes trauma to anyone involved, genuinely a great war and psychological piece.
Leonard Nimoy is great as Sentinel Prime. The rest is whatever.
Ultraviolent. Firmly a film of it's time. Not so subtle satire. But RoboCop just works!
You make a lot of my friends nervous. A lot of people... would love to see a guy like me... put a guy like you out of business.  Best robot movie of all time.
sis the trauma
I wanted to like it more than i did. It's well made, has a good soundtrack and is well shot but i didn't find many of the characters interesting and the ones that were didn't get enough screen time in my opinion. There is however a plenty of things to enjoy about it regardless of it's flaws.
Frances McDormand has to get at least one more Oscar to amend for this one...
This film was weird to me because I've seen the opening training segment parodied so much in other media that it kinda felt like a comedy, but then that stuff with Vincent D'Onofrio hit me hard, his face was some of the creepiest vibes I've seen in a while. The rest of the film as a Vietnam study touches on some interesting issues around the political themes of the war which a lot of other popular Vietnam films don't explore.
Robocop and Predator are two very similar films. They were both released in 1987. They both feature unique settings and fantastical science fiction characters. They both relied on heavy special effects back in the day. They’re also both incredibly boring. In the case of Robocop, At least it has ingenuity. A police officer named Alex Murphy lives in an apocalyptic... Chicago? Detroit? I don’t remember off the top of my head, but it’s apocalyptic for reasons unexplained. He ultimately gets barraged with bullets and is reanimated in electrical steel armor, cyborg style. Then, he continues for the rest of the hour and a half bringing criminals, and the main antagonist (the dad from That 70’s Show) to justice, encapsulating the ‘American way.’ It’s not a bad idea, and at least the events that occur in Robocop have become iconic. It doesn’t have much else going for it in terms of achievement or lasting critical acclaim. The special effects in particular, which I’m sure were fantastic back then, are appallingly bad. This is why movies with extreme special effects are less likely to be received critically. Unless you have the trademark effects in Star Wars or Raiders of the Lost Ark that have become synonymous with their respective franchises, it’s safer to stay away from the newest wave of special effects. There will always be new developments in effects that will make older ones outdated. Robocop went all out, and is now experiencing the consequences. Aside from this, the movie is cheesy. Not in the endearing way used to describe other more beloved films, but in a way that makes you cringe. The acting is sub par, and although the plot is extravagant enough to be genuinely interesting, they fail to make it resonate with viewers.
I fell asleep watching this in the theater, and it was in the middle of an action sequence. I think that says enough.
www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTQAXX08A-s&feature=youtu.be
30 years later and it's still the most accurate depiction of Detroit.
The best Transformers movie still sucks.
i can’t help myself from sounding like an asshole! if you’re opinion of this movie is separating it into two parts one of which is good and one of which is bad you are a LOSER and you don’t understand how to watch movies! maybe there are no wrong opinions but yours sucks! this is the best war movie i’ve ever seen—certainly the funniest.
Awesome. Awesome to the max.
I make no apologies for being a Michael Bay and Transformers apologist. However, while Dark of the Moon is enjoyable in patches, it's not a good movie for the most part. With all that said, it features one of the most bizarre sequences I've ever seen put to film, in which a scenery-chomping John Turturro is screaming complete gibberish at Alan Tudyk in a standoff with two Russian babes. Explain that to me... Leonard Nimoy
“You climb like old people fuck, Private Pyle!” Stanley Kubrick is the 🐐, hands down. 95/100
Robocop sits in a decade filled with incredible action films, but it sticks out and remains memorable 30 years on. Despite a slew of bad sequels, a mediocre remake and a reputation of dated ness, Robocop stands as a definitive film for the action fan. Crisp action sequences, great effects (for the time), and dark satire (even though it’s pretty on the nose..) push robocop into that upper echolon. Peter Weller and Kurtwood Smith play off of each other wonderfully in between blasts of ridiculous violence and a surprising human touch. Easily Paul Verhoeven’s masterpiece.
At its worst, it's excessively violent, painfully long, wastes a whole slew of highly talented actors while also brewing some of the worst performances you can expect in a major film like this and full off horrible, mistimed, awkward humour with weird sexual references. At its best, it's reasonably fun robot on robot schlock. Leonard Nimoy has a good turn as Sentinel Prime, a Transformer with an actual interesting character that gets criminally underused in turn for horses of faceless robots gargling nonsense and getting shot in the head (like the last two, it even has the now accidentally traditional moment where the crew obviously forget which robot is which, shown in this film as one voice is shared between two robots in a scene). The story is relatively simple enough when you look at it, but the film insists on spending 90 minutes setting it up going through more needless conspiracy theories as though you didn't get enough in the previous two, resulting in a bloated and overcomplicated storyline that ends up contradicting the stories that came before it. It's certainly not the worst entry in the Transformers series, but that doesn't make it a good film. There's just enough fun in there for me to scrape a like for it, and that's mostly due to Leonard Nimoy. Oh yeah, and what the fuck is Buzz Aldrin doing in this movie?
I'm just going to take a wild guess about what the Robocop remake changed, and probably got wrong in the process. - An unprecedented bulletproof robotic cop has fights with street thugs that last more than twenty seconds - A central performance that isn't physically stiff but still completely holds the screen at every second - Murphy gets back in touch with his family - Shorter scenes of Boddicker's gang just hanging out and being slime - Not abruptly ending as soon as possible
I don't mean to sound like biocentric, but when those robots start fighting they all look alike to me.
My expectations weren't especially high for Robocop. On the surface, it really looks like another mindless 80's shoot-em'-up. That couldn't be further from the truth! It's a smart, self-aware movie, with witty social commentary and great characters, it's emotionally investing, and the truly kickass action scenes are just the icing on the cake! If only more action films were like this one. The violence is hard-hitting, the special effects are great, and it's an absolute blast from start to finish. And the ending is just the best!
A great film. One of those movies that just pulls emotions out of you without telling you what to feel. It's disturbing, gruesome, powerful, and sad. It tells the true horrors of war and when the men laugh at crude jokes or play with a body, you understand why, because of empathy.
This is maybe the most amazingly violent and grim PG-13 movie that was ostensibly made to sell toys to children that I have ever seen. A robot vulture assassin disguises himself as a friendly toy robot to get close to his target's daughter before killing him and his entire family. After the Decepticons take over the city of Chicago, we're treated to scenes of cowering civilians being shot and reduced to smoldering piles of bone and tattered clothes. Baby Decepticons are drawn and quartered by Autobots who turn into fully branded NASCAR stock cars. Starscream is blinded by having bombs shoved into his eyes and spends his final moments of life before said bombs blow up his head flailing about helplessly, blubbering about how he can't see. There is an implication that the Decepticons killed JFK. Autobots are lined up in front of a trench while their Decepticon captors prepare to execute them with a bullet to the back of their heads. This movie ends with Optimus Prime going on what could only be described as a "murder jog" through the streets of Chicago, killing any and all Decepticons who dare get in his way. All this is to finally reach and confront his mentor, Sentinel Prime (voiced by Leonard Nimoy), who he has discovered was a Decepticon collaborator this entire time. They have a brief fight that ends with Sentinel getting scalped and begging for his life while crawling on the ground, a request Optimus answers by shooting him in the head with a shotgun from point blank range not once but twice. Then Megatron, having perhaps recently gained some perspective on the hopelessness of the Transformers' endless conflict by the endless horrors surrounding him, approaches Optimus Prime and offers him a peace treaty. In the original script, this offer was genuine, and this version of events survived long enough in the production process to make it into the movie's novelization and comic book adaptation. In the actual movie though, Optimus Prime, without even looking at Megatron, grabs an axe and suddenly swings around so he can bury it deep into Megatron's face. So deep that when he tries to pull it out, Megatron's entire head and part's of his spine come with it. And as Megatron's head hits the ground, the camera lingers on it, his eyes still wide with horror and confusion even as the light quite literally drains from them. Optimus Prime's Autobots and several of their human allies then slowly approach their leader from behind in such a way that suggests the filmmakers know how monstrous Optimus' actions were and that the other characters are appropriately horrified and will call their supposedly fair and just commander out on them. They do not and the credits roll within about a minute. I have only seen this movie once and for better or worse I don't think I'll ever forget it.
who cares?
Now I know where Aronofsky's mother! inspiration came from. Like in mother!, the guests overstayed their welcome, and slowly invaded the host's privacy.
It doesn't get that rating because I liked it... it gets it because it totally accomplishes what it sets out to do. Its executed to near perfection. The only part I hate is the ending where they rewind back. Nope, not going to accept that... she killed him and thats that. The plot is obviously disturbing and cruel. As its meant to be. There is some caution taken ie they dont kill the kid on-screen, nor do they show the father being stabbed. The acting is great as you truly feel sorry for the protagonists and you thoroughly hate the antagonists. Not much more I want to say about this film. It really pissed me off, so congratulations, mission accomplished.
Trash. Don't recommend.
"I am extremely scared of physical violence" -Michael Haneke It's crazy how someone very opposed to physical violence would create one of the greatest commentaries of the glorification of it in media. Being a guy who is into over exaggerated violence I realize that this film was made to speak to me. All off camera events are the events a typical sadistic film would include at great detail. Here Haneke details the things surrounding the actual acts of violence. The 4th wall breaking is so good and shows how the sadistic killers are in control of the film similar to how sadistic viewers of movies are in control of what kind of movies get made. It's all about supply and demand. Lot of super great meta commentary that is a stern pushback to violence in media.
Fucking cunts... That was not a funny game! 😤  So this is a critique of society’s weird love-hate relationship with violence? The reason I assume this is because we aren’t shown anything too graphic yet we stayed till the end and put up with the violence in hopes of witnessing a satisfying ending where immorality is trumped. Additionally, whenever Paul broke the 4th wall we’re forced to accept that we’re complicit in the violence and the rewind scene encapsulates the overall message that we have the option to switch off/avoid violence yet we probably won’t do so. Aside from Haneke I can’t think of anyone else who executes (pun intended) an idea so, consistently, well – he does a great job of forcing the audience to spectate and evaluate.
5x5 - Directors challenge: Haneke The film starts with a tracking shot of a car, where a happy family plays name that tune with classical music. This classical music is jarringly interrupted by screaming death metal. This foreshadowing might be understated compared to what happens in the film. While I am not a fan of this type of hostage situation, helpless victim type of film. Haneke, the director, did have a few things going for him that held my interest. First of all, he pushes the action far beyond what you would expect from your typical motion picture. He definitely does not pull any punches. We also see the film held up as a masochistic mirror to the audience. At a couple of moments the lead kidnapper looks directly into the camera as if to say “you guys like this? Ok, I’ll keep going.” The first time he does it he literally winks at the camera. Haneke seems to be torturing the audience as well, giving us hope only to take it away in a surreal moment towards the end. While this particular film would be added to my list of “one-timers”, there is enough going on that makes me interested and a little excited to venture further into Haneke’s catalogue.
It doesn't need to show the violence to be sinister nor in a way disturbing. We know what's happening. Also loved the 4th wall breaking. Did it have a good ending? Well, it depends on which one did you bet on, I guess. I won mine.
This is an horror movie, no question. The level of tension we feel throughout the film is painful. It's not gory, there is no jump scare but still it is incredible how bad you feel at the end of it. A masterpiece. Some scenes are fairly slow with the intention to let us absorb the absurdity of the situation.
MICHAEL HANEKE SIR ARE YOU OK?
“He’s a spoiled little shithead, tormented by ennui and world-weariness, weighed down by the emptiness of existence.”  A visercal attack on anyone willing to view it. I really admire what Haneke does here. It’s not pretty, but the content presented is important for us to digest. Why do we want to watch this? Haneke implicates us in being privy to the violence presented onscreen; which doesn’t feel good whatsoever. What’s even more uncomfortable is that he does so in a way that’s quite tongue and cheek. However as I said, it’s important we reckon with the inner workings of how media violence can mold and desensitize our psyche. What’s the point of it? There isn’t one. But that’s the point. Frankly, I think Pasolini’s Saló does what Funny Games does a lot better, but that’s just me. This film sees Haneke at his most nihilistic, which says a lot actually. An experience you won’t soon forget.
I probably didn’t need to watch both versions of this but I’m still glad I did
Wow I heard so much about this film. A creepy sinister film ... now I gotta see the remake
once you set up the two side and make enough tension, then just play with the tension: accidents, however trivial is fine. It is like a child throwing his temper for no reason. Whatever happens, the next event is doomed to happen. The music and sound tells you what is going on. Only the broadest stuff is shown. That's stylist and even a bit weird. The weirdness is all what is pursued in a suspense movie. All the elements that are unsettling count. This could be the first movie that I can't take anymore. It is so close to reality. The men, the setting and everything. I guess that's where I should go further to
82 Had I not seen the American remake (also directed by Haneke) this would be rated higher. It was almost a weird kinda déjà vu seeing this version be pretty much beat for beat the same exact film with a different cast. This is scarier than most horrors because this is one of the more believable and realistic scary scenarios. To have two complete strangers forcefully invade their way into your home and psychologically torment you with all intentions to eventually kill you is terrifying. Especially when they look completely normal and harmless otherwise. The abrupt use of heavy metal over the opening credits was a genius move and really prepared you for the chaos that's to come from a peaceful getaway. Enjoyed how the movie ends as a loop, bringing them right to the door of their next victims. Also breaking the fourth wall is something I usually can't stand but it really works here. I definitely suggest seeing it if you haven't seen the remake, but it's pretty much the same film so you could go with either one.
This movie was dope. I was like :O the whole time, also it’s so funny that the director remade his own movie
For months this has been sitting in my Filmstruck watchlist and for months I thought this Austrian film starred Antonio Bandaras?  BUT WOW WHAT A MOVIE WHERES THE REMOTE
An uncompromising commentary on violence in media that pulls no punches in confronting and frustrating it's audience.
ok this shit fucked me up in a few different ways. so gripping and intense
IF YOU ARE A FAN OF HORROR IS ANY WAY YOU HAVE TO WATCH THIS!!!!!!!!!!!!! This is easily the best horror I’ve seen, the fact the film is so realistic add an extra layer of brutality absent from most horror films  My favorite part of the film though is how it criticizes people who watch horror in the first place, saying they get the same type of pleasure out of watching people being tortured/killed as the killers doing it  It expresses this idea in many ways (becoming more obvious towards the end) but I think the cleverest is through its forth wall breaking which is only done by the killer, imply that he’s torturing this family for the audiences pleasure  Needless to say it’s some heavy shit
This is a very cruel film. That’s the only way I can think to describe it. I think Haneke is a brilliant director. He gets fantastic performances in every film I’ve seen of his so far. His use of sound is so carefully and thoughtfully constructed (eg the refrigerator’s hum coming and going, which not only dramatically punctuates many moments but also roots it in a reality as many these kind of details would be ignored in most films). I love his shot choices; how they are framed, the lighting choices, how every single one is paced, etc. The efficacy of his films is undeniable. He is clearly fascinated by our relationship to what we see on screen and I think he truly considers all the complexities of this matter. This is all leading to one big BUUUUUUUUUUUUT: From what I have seen through his films and interviews (though admittedly it is not a large amount), I have many issues with his absolute morals. I think he believes he is somewhat of the arbiter of morality in cinema, which has lead him to be partially incapable of any self-reflection. The man has murdered multiple animals for his films, and I believe can be somewhat hypocritical to his own moral axioms in regards to the viewers relationship with the screen. Ultimately I want to watch more of Haneke’s work because I think he is clearly a brilliantly skilled filmmaker and I think there is a lot to learn from him. But I would implore him (not that he will ever read this mind you, but still) to revaluate his beliefs and lead him to more empathetic filmmaking.  That is not to say you can’t make grotesque films, I think Naked is in many ways a horrible viewing experience, but I can tell it is rooted in empathy and is not as entrenched in stern absolutist morals (or perhaps a-morals).
HAD to watch this 4 uni and worked myself up so much thinking it would be disgusting but, compared 2 my expectations, it like wasn't that bad? it was horrific in how real and how slow it was, it was very self aware which doesn't rlly make up for being quite boring . maybe not fleshing anyone out enough, u feel the visceral pain of the family but u dnt really know any of them enough to really care and vouch for them . well made and horrible i'm glad i've watched it so boys can stop telling me 2 watch it
I watched the remake of this first and they’re both great films but this just got under my skin on a different level 🧐🧐‼️‼️🚫🧢🔜💰💰
Just... just watch it...
First off, bonus points to Michael Haneke for being the first repeat director in this series. When you hear that a movie breaks the fourth wall or is self aware, you probably think of Deadpool or something else like that. The last emotion you probably associate with a fourth wall break is fear. Yet, somehow, Haneke makes it terrifying. This film is one of the most scary movies I have ever seen. And no jump scares required, in fact, it's quite slow at times. To the effect of being gut-wrenchingly intense and filled with what I can only refer to as soul horror. It isn't startling, it doesn't just scare you and let you walk off, it digs deep into you and absolutely disturbs your very essence. Sound fun? Well, it isn't, and that's great (considering what Haneke's intentions are). This film is a ruthless meditation on violence in fiction, and how deep down, inside, everyone has a bloodlust for what's on the screen. Instead of just indulging in that, though, "Funny Games" twists it into a truer version of itself. Violence on screen just becomes violence. It's completely brilliant. And I'll never sleep again.
This movie was pretty tense and pretty interesting. The acting was really well done, but I was bored a lot while watching this. I wasn't a huge fan of the whole thing, but it tackled violence in entertainment in a really fascinating way.
The shot of the blood splatter on the TV *chef’s kiss* Cinema
Funny Games is a brilliant exploration of violence in film as ‘entertajnment’. There are a lot of negative responses to this movie and I think it boils down to two things: 1. Haneke is undoubtedly confronting the viewer with why we find violence entertaining, while offering up a violent film. Some find this preachy, a little ‘have your cake and eat it to’. 2. Due to the sadistically cruel and aloof villains, who are detached to the extreme from the pain they are inflicting, the whole thing can feel like an exercise in nihilism. Most do not respond well to nihilism. Personally, I did not find the film preachy at all, but I do not typically find torture/horror films fun so perhaps I felt like Hanekes finger wasn’t pointing directly at me. Even if I were in to that type of film, I still think Funny Games is not so much accusatory of the audience as it is curious. Curious about why these types of films can be entertaining. I also do not think the film is nihilistic though I can definitely understand that interpretation.
we all know the moral point haneke was making, it's valid, he definitely didn't need to remake the movie in english to rub it in more, but! it's not about that. it's about that 10 minute long scene of susanne lothar just registering the death of her son, that scene is absolutely horrific and masterful.
I don't remember being this pissed at the guys when I watched the 2007 version of the movie.
Second Haneke film, the first one being The Piano Teacher (which was his international hit), and this one is the first hit that gave him a cult following. Anyone who's seen this movie, or even read the plot synopsis, can see why this stood out. This film makes me feel like The Piano Teacher was tame in comparison. This film is the definition of bleak. From the plot to the cinematography (which is great despite being largely gray in its color scheme) to the incredible performances all around (including the child actor). Considering the messages this film gives about our fascination with violence, I'm now very interested in watching the remake
As always, Michael Haneke indulges in sadism, all for the sake of a didactic message. No amount of mean-spirited narrative tricks and stern moralizing, however, can guise the hypocrisy festering underneath: he "critiques" (I use this word liberally) the immorality of horror films, yet takes immense pleasure in the physical and psychological torture of his characters. Unbelievable; what solipsism this reveals. A fraudulent film from one of the world's most disingenuous filmmakers.
Mixed feelings. Definitely stomach turning at points and I like the question ”why watch violent movies (torture pieces) at all?”, it just seems somewhat heavy handed and one sided.  Props to Haneke for not sacrificing artistic merit and skill for the cause though. The acting and directing is superb, as well as Bonehead of course.
This feels like a giant homage to the “Singing in the Rain” scene from A Clockwork Orange. Except this is less fantastical and cartoonish, and more grim and realistic. The film restraints itself in showing its horrific details, and when it eventually does show something it makes it more powerful that it would’ve been. Their is one scene in which the intruders have left; and the camera just lingers there. You see a man breakdown into tears and it’s horrifically beautiful.  The acting from everyone is fantastic. It’s very tense and the pacing is perfect. From beginning to end, there was an great uneasy feeling in my stomach. It’s not easy to digest, but I loved every minute. All in all, it’s fantastic.
what's the point? please donate to my gofundme to get lanthimos and haneke into therapy together so they can explore their familial shortcomings and their irrational disdain of dogs.
Haneke got fed up with your bullshit
Michael Haneke’s original stunner is a harrowing indictment of human complacency in a world of commercialized violence. A film you will never forget.
Has so much going for it but hella points docked for the meta shit
Still wondering why I watched this entire movie. Don’t waste your time.
fourth wall breaks? german heavy metal? me being confused? my mom walking in during a torture scene and looking at me like i’m a sociopath? this is my kind of movie
Fuck you Michael Haneke. One of my absolute favourite directors once again proves to be a challenging storyteller in this cruel thriller. The performances by the cast were fantastic, full of emotions and intensity that is absolutely exciting to watch and definitely pulls you into the film. The brilliant screenplay and direction by Haneke is masterful in it's implict portrayal of violence and how the story toys with audience expectations as well as defying many genre conventions. The cinematography of this film was as brilliant as the other films I have watched, but the cold tone of the style definitely seemed to lend itself well with the story. It was really interesting experiencing how radical and unique this film is compared to the other Haneke films I have seen, specifically the liberties he took through the narrative. I definitely missed watching a Haneke film after the (somewhat) disappointing Happy End. I can't wait to explore more of this asshole's work (I mean that in the most loving way).
Fairly insufferable.
Although I thought the meta commentary was a tad muddled in spots, this was a thrilling watch from start to finish!
This is pretty much just Haneke criticizing you for wanting to watch this movie. I don't know to what degree it's self aware but I also don't care. The title is ironic to an extent but I do feel like this is just a pitch black comedy. Once the movie goes full on meta at the end, the horror and thriller elements are all gone and we're just watching what's left of a comedy. The conversation the two dudes have at the end about multiple universes and outcomes or something was kind of interesting. The reverse-colored credits was a cool artistic choice. I love the restrain and control that is shown through the closeups. The audience is endlessly manipulated through Haneke's corruption of tropes. He takes hollow characters with no nuance and uses that as his starting point. The film itself is extremely sadistic towards its audience. The arrogant and borderline pretentious attitude throughout the film didn't bother me and I felt that it was very fitting. To everyone who said the games weren't funny, yes they are.
Minus a half star for making me feel like a horrible human being. Horror movies thrill us because we can witness the high stakes from the comfort of our own home or theater seat. Enjoy the ride with no personal investment or risk. Horror fans get a spike of adrenaline on gruesome gore and deaths. And there are plenty of great horror filmmakers that tap into those emotions and drag us along for the ride, saying "Isn't this fun!!" And we all go "Yayyyy!" Then Michael Haenke comes along. And says, "Oh, you like all this senseless violence? Let's roll..." And what comes next is an onslaught of discomfort, that subverts the rules, your expectations, and the normal joy you would get from from those highs of a good evisceration. The first clue is the title card. A well-to-do family driving to their country house with their boat in tow, quaintly playing a guessing game of listening to opera and guessing the piece and composer. The title appears, and we are assaulted with speed punk. This is not going to end well. They are visited by two clean cut boys who proceed to psychologically - and then physically - abuse the family. All is well in the universe of filmdom. Eli Roth made a mint on this kind of stuff. Then, one of the boys breaks the 4th wall and winks into the camera. Oh shit -- we are now a participant...invited into the film...on the side of the bad guys. "You wanted to see some violence? Come sit down next to us." To add insult to injury, Haenke never really gives us the satisfaction of a knife cutting open skin, beatings, baring of flesh, gunshots -- all the trappings of staple horror and exploitation. Everything is kept just off camera as we imagine what is happening, or on the edge of our seat waiting for something to happen. And finally, when we've had enough, and Haenke gives us our long awaited blast of on-screen violence, he inconceivably and immediately strips us of our joy. "Oh, you think you can relish in the kind of violence you were expecting? Because that violence is "better" than the stuff I've already been subjecting you to? No....no, I don't think so. In fact, I'm going to make you wallow in your shame for the next 10 minutes." And by the end Haenke looks at us and says, "You're still here? After everything I've put you through? Well -- you're exactly the kind of person that needed to experience this. Now, go to your room and think about what you've done." Every moment of this film is a tactical manipulation of the audience; a commentary on society's ambivalence to and even celebration of violence. Natural Born Killers attempted this but got caught in the cycle of showing the effect of violence in the media by showing violence in media. Haenke deconstructs it into its parts, and then removes the pieces that give us that thrill, and then presents it back to us as a plateful of dread and despair. This is obviously not for everyone. But it is filmmaking in its finest form. It achieves exactly what it sets out to do, which is to reflect back on us who we are. And Haenke isn't going to give us an answer to our questions -- or a reprieve. I have not seen the 2007 remake. I don't think my soul can handle another screening.
This movie is a work of art. It's definitely not for everyone, but every decision Michael Haneke made while crafting this film was the correct one, and it all shows on screen. I don't wanna go into too many details because I don't want to mark this as a spoiler review, but a couple of vague notes: 1. The period from 65 minutes to 76 minutes is one of the single greatest scenes in movie history. 2. A lot of the moment to moment minutiae of this movie was not what I expected. 3. Arno Frisch is stupendous.
Hoop-Tober #29 This ain't my first Hanneke but it feels like that. I saw The White Ribbon two years ago and clearly I was very young to appreciate it and I was so bored with that film, but I am really sure that if I rewatch it now I will like it much more. Funny Games was exactly what I expected it to be and better. It is a small, horror that really brings it home. It is claustrophobic and intense as fuck. I mean we from the one scene to the other and I was shaking. Trembling! It is a film, a horror taht is really intense and you feel like you are sweating with the characters. Like you are unsure about your life like them. I loved that. Haneke's simple but effective direction really is the something else. He will put his camera still and let a scene play without cutting and that what makes you feel so much. It seems like it is playing out in front of your eyes. He would let one cut last for minutes with almost zero movement of the camera and that really added to the film. The acting is top notch. While they all are almost unknown. Everyone gives a damn amazing performance. They are all so real and so subtle. Not one tries to be huge or have that one big scene and that was what made this so great too. This was just a thrill ride. It takes you through so many levels physically and mentally and it asks questions too. A Damn that ending!!!...
The Strangers but good
HoopTober5.0 - film #27 About 20 minutes in, it starts to feel uncomfortable. It only gets worse from there. This is not an easy film. It subverts so many of the things that excite us in horror movies, or just movies in general, and twists them into the worst, most uncomfortable things. There’s one moment when you think that the tide is changing, when you think that you will get some reprieve, and the way it takes it away from you is so nuts that you feel nothing but helpless. And it turns on you and asks if you’ve had enough. It is a film more people should watch, though they might not want to. It will make you question the easy violence that has pervaded our society through movies. We thrive on thrills and violence and this will make you question if that is okay. Not for everyone, but this is a horror film with a message that we should probably listen to.
This film is torturing the audience just as much as it is torturing the actual characters of the film. It's hard to be sadist without being explicit. Usually being explicit is the safest way to get a shock out of the audience. Yet here I am thinking this is probably one of the most sadist and macabre film I've seen in so long and almost nothing was shown. This is what we wanted, this is what we get; there'd be nothing to watch otherwise
is it weird that i liked this better than the 2007 remake even though they’re literally the same movie? 🤔
I’ve never enjoyed the first act of a movie and then hated the rest of the it so much.
Haneke probably thinks he is smart with his meta-commentary, but that doesn't legitimize the very existence of this film! FUNNY GAMES tries to purposefully bore you out of your skull just to get some stupid point across. It's nothing but a bad joke.
The fourth wall breaking in this *chef kiss*
How well is your satire supposed to work if you assume that your audience isn't in on the joke? Does it not make sense that the audience, upon learning that a film is a satire, or at the very least, attempting to be subversive, would expect it to do or be exactly that? Can you honestly expect to use the metanarrative to counteract the audience's supposed desensitization towards violence when the violence in question occurs off-screen? Or are you then relying on your audience to be composed of the kind of people who would already be inclined to sensationalize violence and somehow not know? Who exactly does Michael Haneke think is watching his films? I'm not asking you to answer these questions, or even to imply that these questions have answers. They're more there to highlight what I think is the fundamental reason Funny Games doesn't work for me. Haneke is a talented and meticulous director, and he gets incredibly raw and vulnerable performances out of actors. I would never start a queue to debate that assumption, but I think I've finally realized why the only ones among his filmography to actually shock me are the ones that aren't trying to make me look like an idiot. If he wants to spend millions of dollars making films just to call me a hypocrite, that's fine. More power to him to do what he wants with his creative vision, but he has to prove that I'm a hypocrite first. Funny Games is the cinematic equivalent of the "begging the question" fallacy, assuming the truth of the conclusion instead of supporting it. (Low) 6 / 10 - Decent
Not to be the fashion police or anything, but that outfit she put on during the phone drying scene was awful.
This movie is strongest when the boys are on screen, Family acts well, but they don't drive the narrative. Paul is just a menace and I love it. There is actually a surprisingly low amount of violence and gore, but the psychological torture is all the more taxing.
A well-directed, well-acted, disturbing experience that I will never watch again.
Halloween horror-thon night 24: There was nothing funny about this
Hooptober 5.0 #25 of 31 Definitely one of the most horrifying films yet. Holy #%@! at the sandwich scene and bag-over-head scene. The first time he breaks the 4th wall, I freaked (and we're all just ok with that TV remote??). The long takes were fantastic and the actors all did a really lovely and subdued job. The very last moment of the film was the perfect hook. I love when you get a final twist like that and it leaves you in such fear. As well made a film as I think it is, I never want to see this again. Oh wait, I have to tomorrow...@FunnyGames2007
Michael Haneke's brutal take on the home invasion sub-genre gives a nod, a wink, and a quick breaking of the fourth wall to try and make the viewer feel complicit. Depending on your point-of-view either the audience is being mocked or the joke is on Haneke himself for directing a cynical and deeply unpleasant film to make a rather well-worn point about the depiction of violence. Perhaps it's both.
that rewind section was the most tacky shit i've ever seen
A brutal home invasion film, that explores the relationship the viewer has with violence in film. The film toys with us, it's main antagonist addressing the audience directly. It sure is making a statement about the respinsibility of the filmmaker. While disturbing, it also doesn't show nearly as much as other films of the same topics or genre. The filmmaking is well executed, and while the story isn't original and sometimes silly, the film uses it to it's advantage by playing upon the conventions established in film and the genre in order to critique the audience members. It is a must watch for those interested in the ethics of cinema.
when the xavier dolan look-alike took those bullets and said «one for beavis, one for butt-head» i was shaking and laughing at the same time... this film is amazing
“You're on their side, aren't you? So, who will you bet with?” The Good: Arno Frisch is so terrifyingly charismatic in Funny Games (1997), he reels you in with his charm just to break your trust with these heinous acts. I feel like his character is the perfect embodiment of the critiques on violence and media. All of the other performances are also very well done.  Funny Games (1997) is one of the most suspenseful and risky films I’ve ever seen. It never holds back, it’s completely bleak and terrifying. Funny Games (1997) keeps its tone the whole film, there’s barely a sliver hope within this whole film.  While I don’t think his style was fully formed at this point, Micheal Haneke is still an unstoppable force directorial-wise. I absolutely love how gut wrenching and risky this film is in delivering its themes.  The Bad: There is a twenty minute scene in Funny Games (1997) that completely stops the films films beautifully slow pace. It feels so out of place, I completely understand what was being attempted, it just wasn’t very well done. Funny Games (1997) is often very bland looking. I just felt like the film didn’t have that interesting of framing, I feel like there is so much potential with these characters and this story. Also, I’m going to see Funny Games (2007) very soon. Fun Fact: Director Michael Haneke has said that he never intended Funny Games to be a horror film. Instead his idea was to make a film with a moralistic comment about the influence of media violence on society. It's a subject that Haneke is quite passionate about. 84/100 Would Recommend!
“But I think I just cannot stand to see violence in any way […] Why do we stand still on the motorway when an accident has happened? […] Looking at horrible situations is so fascinating because the spectator is not directly concerned.” – from an interview with Michael Haneke In the opening of Michael Haneke‘s 1997 Funny Games (and his shot-for-shot American remake ten years later), a bourgeois family of three is driving up to their summer home against the tranquility of classical music on the radio. We have no more than glimpsed the family grouped together in a shot before we are aurally assaulted with deafening black metal and the film’s blood red title card. This shocking, subversive intro sets the mood of the rest of the film, informing the audience from the very beginning that this won’t be a pleasant vacation for this family. Funny Games’ premise is deceptively recognizable for any fan of the home invasion horror subgenre. Two young men, Peter (Frank Giering) and Paul (Arno Frisch), politely invite themselves into the home of the affluent George (Ulrich Muhe), Anna (Susanne Lothar), and George Jr. (Stefan Clapczynski), before forcing the family to engage in sick, torturous “games”. Why are they doing this? “Why not?”, Paul earnestly insists, and that’s about as close of an answer within the narrative as we’re given. READ THE FULL REVIEW ON CINECCENTRIC
what a bold, interesting, and refreshing movie... the ending blew my mind... italian chef kiss
i first saw the english version like 10 years ago after getting really stoned for one of the first times in my life. afterwards we ordered like 4 pizzas and ate everything in this kid’s parents’ cabinets. funny games indeed!!
Film 12/45 of 🎃Hooptober5.0🎃 The “breaking of the fourth wall” kinda through me off but, quite entertaining in the messed up type of way.
first Haneke film and I loved it. cant wait to see more from this dude.
SHOCTOBER 9 i had to watch this in parts bc it fucked me up so much
Funny Games is far from being the most extreme or violent film of the 1990s. But it ranks quite high because of its influence, including the theme of torture, and bringing the viewer vicariously into an extremely horrific experience. There are also scenes where the killers are speaking directly into the camera. For any horror fan wanting more than just gore, this brings you into the same house as the victims, yet you’re powerless to do anything but watch. Director Michael Haneke takes a different route, displaying contempt for his audience. Funny Games features the now infamous scene where the two all-white-wearing psycho-kidnappers even have the power to turn back time, in one of the most excruciatingly-maddening scenes ever put on film. We watch as an entire family is psychologically, as well as physically, tortured in their own home. Michael Haneke did the American remake 10 years later nearly shot-for-shot with an English-speaking cast. While neither version of the film is as violent or graphic as other horror films created by lesser directors, its extreme nature and no-way-out tone is more psychologically damaging and long-lasting overall. Haneke is in no way a horror director, and reportedly this film was his response to violence being shown on screen in a fun and/or vicarious way. He is quoted as saying “I don’t really want to be part of this violence pornography of the mass media.” Regardless of why it was made, Funny Games contributed in a major part to extreme cinema and its sub-genres: home invasion and torture porn.
We're at a big loss as a society due to the fact that Michael Haneke doesn't make more horror movies. I mean, maybe he makes social-commentary dramas out of goodwill: knowing that if he were to tread into the horror genre, he would leave everyone else biting his dust. Funny Games is a masterclass in suspense and terror. Not horror - terror. The pacing, the foreshadowing, the imagery, all mingles and meshes in an unforgettable finale. Haneke is like a sadistic fisherman and we are the gullible and stupidly hopeful fish: we latch on to every single piece of bait he throws us. Funny Games is terrifying: it's cold and sadistic and inhumane and - most scary of all - helpless. A damn good movie.
Duuuuuuude....i give no shits about your stupid college psychology thesis.
Hooptober 5.0 Film #9 TASK #2: Six countries! With this film and its equally effective shot-for-shot U.S. remake, writer and director Michael Haneke proves himself a master at subverting his audience's expectations with such sick and twisted reckless abandon and joy, resulting in Funny Games delivering an experience that's terrifying in its subtlety.
I've always had an affinity for movies that make me feel like shit. A quick peruse through the list of my favorite films reveals there's some pretty depraved stuff in there. Gaspar Noe is my second favorite director, for god's sake. Funny Games has officially joined that canon of incredible movies that make me feel like human garbage for watching them. The films comes across more like a social experiment, pushing the limits of what its audience will endure with a wicked, fourth-wall-breaking smile. Haneke has truly been able to create the most torturous viewing experience I've ever seen. It exists in a world unmediated by goodness or fortune, where pure evil has full and unbridled reign to make *literally* anything happen. It's a film that captures the same unstoppable evil that Ari Aster's Hereditary attempted to represent. Sure, this movie is pretentious as fuck and the social experimental aspects of it might really turn some people off, but if you buy into the premise like I did, it can make for a sickeningly brilliant viewing experience. A funny game, indeed.
31 Days of Halloween Day 14: Funny Games A simple premise; a family goes to their lake house for a little getaway and are subsequently tormented and murdered. Why? Well, that's difficult to pin down. This film is really all about violence for the sake of violence. The killers tell lie after lie about their motives and origins but at the end of the day, none of that matters. The tension starts almost immediately with a nervous young man asking for eggs. Events escalate quickly. Surprisingly, their is very little on screen violence, even nudity is off camera, but we are left with the aftermath of the violence. There is one very long shot in the middle of this film that just goes on and on. It's absolutely harrowing. You really get a sense of what these people are going through and try to imagine how they can possibly go on and function to survive. The one attacker who does most of the talking has a habit of breaking the fourth wall, which is a bit jarring at first but then he does something else and talking to the audience doesn't seem so crazy after all. There's a discussion between the two killers at the end of the film which really sums up this film nicely. You could also just see this as part of the killers insanity, as only he does any of this, maybe he is crazy and talks to an imaginary audience. It's a clever film, it's brutal and funny and I would definitely recommend, 5/5 🎃🎃🎃🎃🎃.
Deadpool 3: Ultimate Rewind I'm guessing most people will either love or hate the gimmick. But I dont know, seems pretty lame and unnecessary. Also it looks like they killed that dog for real. So, fuck this movie
The absolute definition of INTENSE. All white clothes. Maybe a tribute to the droogs and the old ultra violence?
Hoop-Tober 5.0 Film #16 of 34. My list is here. There isn't a film I can think of where a fourth wall break has improved the narrative. It's amateurish and cringeworthy. It is taken to a ridiculous extreme here. I understand the intention. I just think it's laughable. There are no likeable characters in this film. There is nothing inherently unlikable about the family, but there is nothing much to relate to about them either. I was expecting much more from this. I usually really love extreme cinema. Not that this was all that extreme, but I found this to be empty and aimless. How on Earth did this warrant a remake? Why on Earth does everyone like this so much? Hanake is clearly making an uninformed and naive statement about violence here. The argument that by watching we are made complicit in the torture is just not true. The effects model of audience reception is outdated and ignores the complexities of spectator response. So, what he's actually done is just made a really bad film. A film whose only message is that people should feel guilty for watching it. I didn't feel guilty. I just felt patronised. His method of alignment with the killers (the fourth wall break) is so poor that even the films intended purpose comes off as childish. I was not impressed, but I'll give it an extra half a star for the opening credit music.
I only knew the remake so far. Although I don't like German films, the original was actually much better. Very oppressive.
It’s still stressful even in German
Showed my girlfriend this because I loved it so much and now she's not talking to me because she blames me for how horrible the bad men were to the dog.
The movie that says onscreen suffering is for our enjoyment takes the joy out of onscreen suffering.  Cool.
Halloween Horror Challenge 12/31 I did not expect this film to have such an effect on me the way it did. In the space of its runtime I went from curiosity to pure amazement to absolute boredom to somewhat satisfied. The first act is fantastic in building up suspension and making you feel uneasy. The long take shots were really impressive and really added to the uncertainty of the scenes. This part of the movie had me hooked. The second act starts with a bang that was so well executed that I couldn’t wait to see what happened next. Except nothing did. It became slow and boring and the long shots started to overstay their welcome. I understand what the film makers were going for but I think they took it a step too far. The final act picks up the pace once again but for me the momentum was ruined. I could no longer love this movie the same. The ending wa great but the second act left such a poor taste in mouth. Despite this I can’t deny this was a good film that was extremely well made. The great acting and brilliant use of the fourth wall are also note worthy too.
31 Days Of Horror Complex’s Most Disturbing Movies Of All Time List  36. Funny Games (1997) : This is another very popular one when it comes to disturbing cinema, it’s one of those movies that mostly uses its suspense and atmosphere to be disturbing. Which works perfectly for this movie, the movie has some incredibly strong writing that makes it stand out. It’s one of those movies that will get under your skin and actually care for the characters hoping they make it out alive. So does this belong on the list ? It absolutely does, it’s a brilliant movie from beginning to end and will leave you disturbed!  9.4/10 A
"Stevie . . . I haven't slept in a year." The Machinist is strong for the first hour or so. Christian Bale's (Trevor) angular thinness pervades every moment. The film is a washed-out hallucinatory daze brought on by sleep deprivation. It's intriguingly ambiguous and the main cast delivers solid performances. Unfortunately, the back half of the film becomes increasingly self-indulgent and irritating, and it finishes on that note. It's full of interesting details that I wish were in service of a better movie: There's a machine, or commerce, prominently featured in almost every scene; Trevor only has relationships mediated by or adjacent to commerce; and the body horror elements, which make a lot of sense based on the ending. I want the film the first half promises, not the one the second half delivers.
3 1/2 Stars  Best Performance: Christian Bale (duh) Scene Stealer: John Sharian Score: 7/10 Worth Seeing? Yes Rewatch Factor: 6/10 Additional Notes: Wow, this movie was insane.
Same as American Psycho, weird. But I'd have to say it's a great film, the scene on the arcade ride is one of the smartest scenes I've seen in anything. Visually great and adds to the film
Christian Bale is so good in this, but, while I loved this in college, the seams show more now than they did then. It still works nicely as a Dostoevskian thriller, though maybe in a lot more of a straightforward fashion. In the end, it is the Bale show. While this film is mostly famous for him getting skinny, he does manage a desperate performance underneath the physical transformation.
Basically a knock-off of Fight Club
Christian Bale is gaunt, and that's really all the film is known for. Not his best performance or film. The rest is honestly largely forgettable.
Rewatched this movie while I was at work actually lol, I found myself thinking about Christian Bale movies (as one does) and decided to rewatch this nightmare film on my phone while I was packaging orders. If you haven't seen this movie before, I don't recommend multitasking while watching this for the first time because this movie needs you to watch every little thing for it to really make sense in the end and for you to really enjoy it. It is also a definite downer film, so be ready for that. But it really is a great film, very scary and intense and somehow bale still looks like a SNACK even in his sickly state don't @ me
I need to look up/ watch interviews on how Christian Bale got to that body weight, because that was insane. One of the most versatile actors when it comes to changing body mass for roles. A good, not great film that I definitely recommend checking out if you love mystery thrillers.
The story was good but it took waaay to long to get to anything worth really paying attention to.
Synopsis: Christian Bale stars in the mystery thriller, The Machinist. Bale is Trevor Reznick and the film opens with him trying to dispose a dead body into a river. An undisclosed amount of time later, he is back at work. He gets along with his co-workers but keeps to himself and does not socialize. He also spends each evening getting coffee and pie with a waitress Maria that he likes at the airport. Due to his insomnia this is always around 1:30 in the morning. Things continue this way, but Trevor is suffering from insomnia and says to a prostitute Stevie (Jennifer Jason Leigh), that he visits frequently, that he has not slept in a year. One day at work, he gets distracted by a mysterious co-worker Ivan he met, and as a result the man he was supposed to be supervising gets into a horrific accident and loses his arm. This begins a downward spiral for him as his co-workers begin to dislike him and his neurotic behavior. Mysterious notes begin showing up on his fridge, he forgets to pay his bills and he starts to think there is a conspiracy against him. Either it is his current co-workers, Miller who lost his arm, or maybe even the Maria he frequently visits at the airport. Perhaps it is even the mysterious Ivan who only shows up here and there to tantalize him. When he can’t even trust Stevie and he is told there is no Maria at the airport he always frequent, he starts to think everyone is out to get him. Trevor must figure out who is out to get him, so he can keep his sanity or what little of it he has left. Review: The Machinist is a solid unraveling mystery. The tension just slowly increases throughout the film. Because Reznick is a loving and caring person overall, you feel for him and want him to get better and get over his insomnia. Christian Bale’s weight lose for the film is quite astonishing and turns him into a character that appears more frail, lonely and endearing. With Jennifer Jason Leigh as the prostitute you have another layer of desolation and sadness. All the characters are down to Earth and relatable, so that’s what makes the story resonate more. When the mystery itself is revealed, part of it seems lackluster given all the events that happen in the film. Despite this, you still feel a sense of redemption and satisfaction for Trevor as now he can finally rest. Some of timeline of all the events are confusing and they ask the audience to put it together as well as some of the relationships with the characters. It really makes you decide what is real and what isn’t, or when or when he was not hallucinating. Bale’s acting is great and his dedication to this film is astonishing. He apparently ate only tuna and an apple a day, and even took up smoking to curb his appetite. Except for Reznick, nobody else gets much closure or anything else. Despite this The Machinist is a solid and well directed mystery. The music, pacing and misdirection throughout the film keeps what could have been a very boring movie into more of an engaging one. 4 Stars -11.29.2018
this movie is the definition of “mind-fuck” and i loved almost every minute of it. the ending was kind of half-assed though :(
2nd time watching this movie and I’m giving it half a star lower. I think I enjoyed it more the first time, but this time round I’m much surer on why it is a phenomenal film. Does that make sense? It’s gross to look at, and the whole film had me feeling weird. The shots of Bale and his anorexia are hard to watch, and even passing scenes such as Bale eating wings had me feeling uneasy. You know it’s setting up for a weird twist, but you don’t know what’s coming, and the 2nd time round I’m just as impressed. I was really excited by the use of light and darkness. There is one particular scene where Bale walks to use his cigarette lighter and he walks from an area where the sky above is light and clear into a dark, gloomy and stormy area. This is just as we are introduced to an integral aspect of his demise. There is plenty more of this, but you’ll have to find it yourself. I believe my 4.5 was initially overstated, but this is a great movie.
Bale's performance is brilliant and really elevates a mediocre movie about mental deterioration to a good-ish one. Really would have prefered if the film handled the subject of "which events are even really happening?" a little more subtly instead of shoving it in your face so heavily. Overall felt like a poor man's version of Memento, but still worth a watch, be it only for Bale's acting.
Not great. This movie is nothing more than the Christian Bale gets skinny film.
Honestly its crazy how thin Christian Bale got for this role. He was excellent in this film and should have atleast been nominated for an oscar for his performance. 7.4/10
I don't know which is more impressive, Christian Bale's performance, or his dedication. He drops 63 pounds for this role, to the point that he can barely run.   “A little guilt goes a long way.” — Trevor  Probably the most important line in the entire film, and you don’t even know it yet…
Come for skinny Christian Bale, stay for interesting-but-not-amazing psychological intrigue.
Left or right way?
The portrayal of mental deterioration in this film is some of the best. Anyone who knows me knows that I’m a huge fan of psychological thriller/horror films. And this one delivered in every regard. Christian Bale’s performance in this is my favorite of his that I’ve seen. It is so haunting and he disappears into his role. I love films like this that play with your mind as well as the characters because then when things start to unravel it’s all the more interesting. One of the very best in this genre in my opinion. Definitely a must watch if you’re into the sort of Alfred Hitchcock type vibe. Reminded me a lot of Psycho when I was watching it.
“If you were any thinner, you wouldn’t exist.”  Christian Bale is cool, even when he prepares for a role with a wierd daily diet of an apple, a canned tuna, coffee, and cigarettes. His breath must’ve been pretty bad, honestly.  Oh, and the movie is good. I think some of the dialogue is bad, and some performances are clunky, but, dear God, does Bale give a great performance. And the story is memorable! That’s good.
Christian Bale dropped sixty pounds to play a drill-press operator plagued by insomnia. Director Brad Anderson brings the suspense but its Bale's gripping, palpably discomfiting tour de force that holds you in thrall. Its mesmerizing.
'The Machinist' is a dull and anti-climatic film that is only held up by a strong and committed performance by Christian Bale. I had not heard much about this film prior watching it, and my only knowledge on it was that Bale had lost a significant amount of weight for this role. The opening scene promises a dark and compelling (murder?) mystery, but as soon as this scene is over, the remainder of the film drags on. It became clear from the beginning that the character is insane, and therefore not everything is reality. By revealing this so early into the film, the plot-twist at the end isn't anything special. There's no 'ah-ha' moment where you sit there, surprised, shocked and entertained once the movie makes all sense. It's rather an 'oh, okay' moment. While I think the plot wasn't too bad in itself, it was simply the whole way this film was directed. Overly long scenes combined with a very bleak color palette can easily diminish ones attention. However, this film does have a few silver linings. Christian Bale does a fantastic job in this role, fully embodying the character - even from a physical level. The complexity and insanity of the character is highly believable and I'm surprised this did not get an Academy Award nomination! The supporting cast also do a fine job in their roles but were all evidently undermined by Bale. Another perk of the film was the eerie and surreal soundtrack by Roque Baños, who contributed the most to the bizarre and psychotic atmosphere that lingers over this film. Overall, this film was a disappointment for me as it dragged on and led to nowhere. However, it's always a pleasure watching brilliant acting play out on the screen, as well as hearing a masterful soundtrack.
Watched for Cinema 107. Good movie with lots of subtle symbolism and lots of obnoxious symbolism. Also how much can you borrow from Fight Club without being a total ripoff? Honestly my biggest gripe is the score. The orchestral score really sticks out like a sore thumb. A Trent Reznor score or something like the score from Under The Skin would have complimented the gritty, high contrast visuals much more. Instead it’s this bland conventional score trying to sound like the next Hitchcock soundtrack. Go full grit, make it really fucking nasty. Not this half ass grit.  Honestly with a better score and a trim of some really stupid dialogue and obnoxious imagery I would probably love this movie.
Why Christian Bale can't sleep at night?? Because he's a BATMAN!!!
Bale is fantastic in this Alfred Hitchcock clone of a film.
No more Christian Bale before bed.
It seems Patrick Bateman may have taken the “you can always be thinner” thing a bit too far. Movie Game
SPOILERS FOLLOW   We can see the twist of this coming a mile away, yet a couple things hold our attention about this film. 1.) Christian Bale's 110% committed performance, dedicated to giving it his all. What we get for it isn't, for a psychological thriller, a deeply unsympathetic character. Instead, he's a surprisingly decent character who finds himself at odds with what he's becoming and a reflection of what he sees himself as. What we see him as versus what sees himself as makes it challenging and a bit more engaging than other films where it would be easy to make the same movie, but without the same connection to the main character. 2.) The dark tone is unyielding, like the David Fincher movie Se7en but ultimately that has it's rewards because much of it, going back to Bale, comes from his own perception. That leads to three, the clues. Easy to piece together but the filmmakers want to encourage us to think and decipher what they mean. When you fully realize the movie is from Trevor's eyes, which are deceptive and misleading to even him. By the end, if our connection to Trevor is held through the rest of the movie, we'll see him not differently but in a deeper light. Deeper, more understanding and perhaps even more sympathetic than before. The truth that Trevor sees himself as a monster, a child killer will help him find peace with what kind of man he is. Not a monster, but a deeply traumatized individual who needs to accept that his denial is the only thing that's stopping him from moving forward. His guilt manifests everywhere in his life; his acceptance helps him move forward. When I think about Shutter Island, I think about the clues not leading anywhere despite being an interesting concept. When I think about this, I think about the clues not being hard to figure out but they come second to a disturbing and fascinating character study that has a hopeful conclusion for it's flawed but redeemable main character.
Only as good as it is because of Bale’s astonishing commitment to the role, but the rest of this (especially the twist) didn’t do much for me. The score was hilariously bad in places and detracted from the seriousness of what was unfolding.
Bale's memorable performance till date 😎 Wicked 👍🏻
Bale goes all put and delivers a great performance in this gritty tale of regret and physical and existential emptiness.
I'm a big fan of The Machinist and the way everything is executed is just amazing, especially for someone who is watching it for the first time. I find this film difficult to really think or write or talk about without spoilers. It's one of those films that you just don't want to discuss. You just have to tell everyone that they have to see it. Myself, I've introduced many people to The Machinist, and get a lot of joy watching their reactions as the story unfolds. So, if you have not seen The Machinist, definitely check it out.
Epic film with a satisfying twist and bittersweet ending (mainly bitter).
The Silent Hill 2 of movies.
I guessed right mostly because I’ve seen Fight Club.
this is really just fight club’s lame cousin. people are saying that this is a modern day hitchcockian film but that is honestly such an insult this film is hardly original and recycles a lot of the “split-personality twists” that ever so often hit its mark. if my head wasn’t so far up christian bale’s ass i probably would’ve reviewed this film lower.  and so what if i’ve never seen a hitchcock film before Lmao. shudder just released a bunch of  them so this baby boy having himself a snack this halloween. then maybe my review of this may change by probably not.
Impressive body transformation and performance by Bale. Sadly, that is the only impressive part to this movie.
A disturbing look in to insomnia and paranoia. Christian Bale is as always amazing. He completely transformed in to this role. For an actor that usually oozes charisma, that is all gone here. Most movies of this nature give the watcher the question of "is this real or is he crazy?" This movie made clear from the get go that Trevor is crazy and suffering from severe insomnia and that makes it all the more tragic. There were moments throughout of pure tension that kept my eyes glued to the screen. I was worried that such an interesting build up wouldn't have a satisfying conclusion but rest assured, The Machinist will leave you satisfied, disturbed, and after watching the effects of sever insomnia, ready to go to sleep.
The dreamy unnerving score, the Hitchcock feels and the skinniest man alive. Still good fourteen years later.
The Machinst evokes a dream-like feeling in the film, which, of course, goes with the subject matter; almost every facet of the film builds a sense of paranoia, topped off by Christian Bale's startling performance. While the ending doesn't fully feel built towards in a way that feels immensely satisfying, it is still a cyclical payoff that should entertain well-enough. The Machinst is a prime example of a film that takes a concept and allows it to permeate every part of its finer and for better or worse, it'll leave you feeling uneasy, and rarely every sleepy.
Yes this movie was a slow starter and yes at points it was very hard to watch, but Christian Bale was so good that he made you connect with his character on a level that made it impossible to look away. You got right into the head of a person suffering from insomnia and because of the way the movie was made, you able to see it from his point of view. While I wouldn't say that this was an extremely entertaining or fun movie, it was definitely something that drew me in and kept me trying to figure out what exactly was going on.  Entertainment level - 7/10 Acting - 10/10 Writing - 8/10 Story - 8/10
It's hard to separate the facts of the making of the film from the film. If you go so far as to actually damage your body for a role, it is really worth it? So many crazy actors have done that, including Robert Redford. Is it really acting? Fassbender lost a lot of weight, but they also used makeup and he did it under medical supervision. As Laurence Olivier said to Dustin Hoffman, 'Try acting dear boy'.
like a modern day Hitchcock film and I'm a fan
christian bale’s doctor must fucking hate him lmaooo all these drastic body transformations....
i love nightmarish movies, i love movies that are able to convey a mood. its great
Macbre, gloomy, egregious, an encomium of depravity and a fascinating ballad of misconception. This movie has to be the best Christian Bale performance. Ofc all of us know about the typo in the screenplay which made him as thin as an anorexic patient through extremely intellectual web portals like BuzzFeed or Huffpost (erudite portals redefining pedagogy, I must say.) Coming back to the movie, it's greyish teal tint colour pallet added to the gloom. If the phallus stroking of movies like Fight Club would stop, people would notice that there are other worthy movies, better executed than Fight Club, in the same genre.
Christian Bale is great. He looks completely emaciated in this movie. Truly bizarre. Jennifer Jason Leigh is so fantastic too, easily one of my favorite actresses, love her so much. She did such a great job with this role, I always found the scenes with her in contrast to Bale powerful. I got chills during the scene with the fishing photo. She's such a real actress. Anyways, the movie was slightly disturbing, but in a really subtle way. I mean, the gore was out there, but just the subconscious references throughout. They seemed pretty obvious, but I'm not the most intelligent movie-watcher, so sometimes it's nice when things don't slip past me. When they're really out there, it helps me create a deeper interpretation of the movie. All in all, it's dark-toned, twisted, and at times feels incoherent. I'm not sure what Insomnia feels like, but I'm okay with riding along with the delusions.
Usually I don't have a thing for color grading as heavy as used in The Machinist, but here it really works out and helps put us into the dreamlike mind of the insomniac. Oozing with style reminding me somewhat of Drive with it's mostly night settings and shots through windows and other reflective material. Things start falling apart rather quick in the story and we question everything on screen. I was guessing until the very end what was really happening, never getting time to breathe through and feeling thrilled up to the last minute. Bale, which I would have told you right before this movie I didn't ever care for, does a great job as the endlessly tired walking skeleton. I could praise him for his body transformation for this movie, but I guess everyone else already did that, I just liked his flat acting style, it seemed believable to me he didn't really sleep for a year and had a barely working memory. For me specially his workplace almost hit too close to home, having had my apprenticeship in a workshop similar to the one depicted. I always had in mind how dangerous the machinery can be and they always make sure to tell you. Seeing accidents that are so likely to happen in real life on screen is a thousand times more scary to me than the usual horror film slasher villain. The movie Raw with one scene in a similar vain managed to make me quit watching before I fainted on my chair. All in all this was really surprising and it will probably settle into higher tiers of rankings for me.
One of the greatest performances ever committed to film. Deeply unsettling and haunting. So underrated.
Everything about this movie gives you a bad feeling. I live for that bad feeling.
(Old impressions, not based on a recent viewing) I remember it having an amazingly creepy atmosphere, but the story was less than impressive.
Kept waiting for a plot twist that was entirely underwhelming. Respect Christian Bale's commitment to this role. Looked like a junkie - so skinny you could see all of his bones and it was grotesque.
Christian Bale steals the show here and his character is very intresting. without him and the intresting cinematogrophy, this film would have suffered.
Christian Bale hasn't slept in a year and is looking extremely gaunt and drawn out. What is causing this odd behavior? What is real and in his head? Nothing is given away until the last 15 minutes where there is a story dump. Bale is incredible as he physically transformed his body into a mess. Slow mosving and not very exciting. Jennifer Jason Leigh anfd Michael Ironside have breif roles.
An absolutely fantastic and deeply gripping psychological thriller in the vein of Fight Club. The movie instills a certain uneasiness throughout, and the story is making you constantly look for clues to solve the unfolding mystery. The conclusion is in my opinion quite satisfying as well. The only minor gripe I have is that the movie is perhaps not entirely original in concept. For what it is, it's very well executed though.
Christian Bale losing all his weight? Christian Hay
A solid piece of Hitchcock worship, especially thanks to Roque Baños' lovely score (that in itself is obviously more Bernard Herman worship, that usage of strings and theremin is splendid), with THAT Christian Bale performance, that thrives on its otherworldly atmosphere but doesn't mold its parts to become something greater.
60/100 From the opening sequence – Reznik (Bale) trying to get rid of a corpse wrapped in a carpet by throwing it in the sea – it’s clear we’re in for some bleak expressionism. Brad Anderson channels Lynch, Polanski, and especially the Christopher Nolan of “Memento” while the film features mirrors, dismemberment, machinery, dead mothers, doubles, Dostoyevsky, power cuts, ghost trains, sewers and a whole load of bleach. Its all a bit too much (Kosar, who wrote the script is also a main culprit), but the emaciated, insomniac protagonist, who tries to fathom how he got to such a bleary, bruised and scarred state of being (and mind) is brilliantly played by Bale. Actually “played” is far too insufficient a verb to express the lengths that he has gone to for the film (he looks so emaciated that you cant help worrying that its terminal). Its all a bit preposterous yet still effective enough and the ending serves to enable the film to make psychological sense which reverberates back through it, adding some much needed (emotional) gravitas, as well as half a star to the grading.
all yall googled how much weight christian bale lost for this movie right.. a can of tuna and 1 apple a day guys
This is the ideal male body. You may not like it, but this is what peak performance looks like.
Keeping it short and sweet on this one. A well paced and tense psychological thriller that's made even better by a stellar performance from Christian Bale, an unsettling score, and great use of recurring visual motifs.
The Machinist was a film that when I first saw, I thought was perfect. Sadly after rewatching it twice, the film is not as good as I remember. Throughout a majority of the film, it's pretty great but near the end the story kind of falls apart. The subtlety becomes a little too in-your-face and boy oh boy do Leigh's and Bale's performances get real bad. It saddens me to not think of this film as highly as I used to, but its stellar beginning and interesting concept make up for a very lacking end.
One of Christian Bales best performances, and ironically I watched it the same day I watched Insomnia. A very mesmerizing film that puts you into the mind of a man that can't separate reality from imagination. You feel you understand what is going on until, NOPE. I was wrong.
A little guilt goes a long way.   Bale is one of the best actors of this generation, and this is some of his best work, this movie for me pushed what acting can be. What you see on screen is revolutionary, but there is no hint of acting, Bale is the character, he had transformed himself physically and emotionally.   Bale could cruise through life taking lightweight acting jobs earning millions of dollars, instead he takes on a fairly low budget movie by a good, but not oscar-likely director. The guy lives and breathes his career for the sole purpose of passion, this shows especially in this role.  The movie is probably not going to be for everyone, very dark and extremely intense. The claustrophobic tension of Bales character is felt when viewing, you find yourself clutching at any figment of reality you can make out. Perfect directing throughout the entire movie, Anderson exceeds all expectation with strong storytelling.  The cinematography matches the dark tone of the films story, lots of green tones almost representative of Trevor’s decaying reality. The entire film is totally unsaturated not a shred of positive colour to be seen, adding to the unsettling nature of the film.  If you ask me the sole purpose of a movie is to evoke emotion, not necessarily happiness, sadness or fear, just a feeling of some kind. After finishing this film I knew i felt something but i couldn’t articulate to myself what it was that I felt, but I suppose put simply I felt both enlightened and disturbed, the movie won’t leave my mind for a long time and with good reason. A must-see for anybody who considers themselves a film fan, I can’t stop wondering if this is one of the best acted movies start to finish that I have ever seen.
Thoroughly entertaining! FFO: Frank Kafka, David Lynch, dramas from the silver age, and Christian Bale skeletons.
Christian Bale could perfectly play Meryl Streep.
I know who you are. I know who you are. I know who you are.
I was really excited for the end of the movie because I expected a plot twist! I can't believe that the reason which was CLEAR FROM THE BEGINNING was the one to be true. If it wasn't for the "excitement for plottwist" this movie was extremely boring. The atmosphere was okay, tho.
Bale was incredible in this, but it felt like a mashup 3-4 different films, each of which handled the material better. The ending also left a bit to be desired and I figured out certain aspects of it by the end of the first act.
Christian Bale is captivating even if I feel like this film put in too many unresolved mysteries that remain unsolved and unexplained after the final twist. Reminded me a bit of Marc Forster’s film ‘Stay’ in regards to its concept.
I think the Machinist might be my favourite movie so far
I've been wanting to rewatch this film for eons. I'm almost certain I've only seen it once, back in 2004 when it first came out and I remember being blown away by it at the time. While I still think it's a pretty solid film, I'm not sure it blew me away as much as it did 18 year old Tarryn. What does still hold up is Bale, his performance and his dedication. That man is an absolute maniac the way he puts his body through such huge transformations time and time again. Forgot JJL was in it too, was a nice treat to see her there. I feel like she doesn't get enough love. Overall, I think the Machinist is still engaging, shot well and is an interesting enough film, but when you know what's coming, it takes away a lot of the magic.
Christian Bale’s performance might be the best I’ve ever seen. All around great movie.
The Machinist is entangled in paranoia, delusions and a disturbingly thin Bale. Everyone has heard of it. Hosting what is possible the most method performance of all time. But, unfortunately, not many have actually sat down and watched this dark psychological thriller. Which ultimately is a shame as it's a rather engrossing production albeit utilising a robust manufactured narrative that resembles a machine. An insomniac machinist is dismissed after a workplace accident, where his psychological issues result in a downward spiral of paranoia. Methodically constructed and meticulously presented, Anderson's cold clinical direction makes for an enthralling experience with plenty of disturbing imagery. The plot highlights the importance of sleep, a necessary function in regulating our bodies. Becoming an insomniac and refusing professional advice, well it may just decrease both an individual's sanity and efficiency. These are clearly indicated in Bale's performance, one of the most notorious and discussed character portrayals of all time. Committed may just be an understatement. He indicated just how far one can go for their dedicated art. An illuminating performance, hypnotically entrancing in every scene. Whether he be flaunting his scarily thin body or staring at the camera with his overly fatigued eyes, the method changes are only aesthetic details. It is primarily his acting that truly transfixes us and carries Kosar's conscientious screenplay. The blue and grey colour palette of the cinematography enhanced the unwelcoming world that we see through Reznik's perspective. However, as meticulous as the plot was, various details were executed far too obviously that made the twisted conclusion underwhelming. Specific plot points such as the post-it note and the unfamiliar co-worker felt too reminiscent of another famous thriller from 1999. Baños' musical score definitely heightened the lunacy of Reznik's mind, but ultimately fell flat and did not suit the environment that Anderson crafted. Fortunately Bale's career-best performance elevates this thriller to psychological heaven.
Reminiscent of Memento, but still a unique movie, nonetheless. No one could have played the lead better than Bale did.
Damn that's depressing
it’s like fight club, a beautiful mind, safe haven etc. where you think characters are real, but they ain’t. I just don’t like this movie trope personally, I know other people get a kick out of it, but I’m like zzzzzz I liked the music in this and the editing. The extremely desaturated colors are not needed as the story is dismal enough. I liked how it paid homage to Hitchcock in a lot of ways. Christian Bale is fantastic as always, but I just wanted him to take a nap and eat a burger plz
Christian fucking Bale
What stands out most here is Bale's acting and transformation for the role of Trevor Reznik. Storywise, it's nothing very impressive. The script makes a good job on showing the effects of extreme insomnia in Trevor's life but the mix-up between what's real and what's not could be better worked.
i just want christian bale to fucking eat
Not Fight Club directed by not David Lynch with a sprinkle of not Max Payne 2, and a short performance by not Michael Keaton. And it's not good. It's meh. You have to be stupid to not realize the post it not doesn't say killer. Frankly, I was hoping it would say Kilmer, revealing Trevor as the Van Kilmer fan he is.
Oh, to be 20 years old again and think that this was the coolest shit ever.
i suffered & he suffered to lose weight he deserves respect i guess
A stunning performance carries a captivating and thrilling plot with surprising depth
It was so painful watching this guy just existing so when he came at the end looking so healthy and shot I cried.
Summer body goals 2.0
Awful. Just awful.  Boring, cringey, crap dialogue, humour doesn’t work... need I go on?
Dc has given up of classic formule of films and adopted the Marvel style and work very well . But as nothing is perfect, the biggest flaw of the movie is the soundtrack that simply doesnt match .
Aquaman and the half-blood prince
That Trench sequence... What a visual feast.
You have to admire the cast for being 100% on board for a script this cheesy and ridiculous, but it's that conviction that carries the film through its messier parts. Patrick Wilson deserves some sort of award for delivering the line "YOU CAN CALL ME... OCEANMASTER!" without even cracking a smile. So is it good? No. Is it fun? Yes. And plenty colourful. An enjoyable fantasy romp even if it does leave you feeling like you just deep-throated a camenbert cheese wheel.
I think Raj (from the Big Bang Theory) owes Aquaman a full engraved apology! This film was not bad. Some bits were rather cheesy, but the action in it were rather pretty good. And the post credit scene...mind-blowing! Plus, Jason Mamoa as Aquaman real made the franchise so bad ass that it brought all them haters to shame. Also, Amber Heard looked pretty hot as a redhead! All in all, while some fans will debate whether or not this was a good or bad film, I am definitely rating this mother f***er a decent 4 stars!
It’s alright, it’s not like most people hype it up to be.  I know the reason for this hype is that it’s been so long since people had seen a good DC film.  I’m just gonna get down to the brass tacks. Positives: 1) Jason Mamoa. 2) Nicole Kidman. 3) Fight Choreography. 4) Visual Effects. 5) Ooooh, that kiss. Negatives: 1) 2-Dimensional Villian. 2) Scenes that could’ve cut down. 3) Way to hyped up music. 4) Confusing World Buliding. 5) Poor Jokes, the theatre was not laughing at all. 6) Abrupt & very distracting cuts during fight scenes. 7) Post Credits scene which ruins the ending of the film. Final Thoughts: Nonetheless, still a good DC movie after a long time. It’s worth the ticket as a entertainer but not as a superhero entertainment.
A very solid first outing in the fantasy blockbuster realm for James Wan. Some CGI was a bit wonky, and a decent whack of the dialogue is a bit cringey, possibly due to the source material (sorry, I can't take the title of OCEAN MASTER seriously, no matter how stone-faced you play it) - but overall it's a fun popcorn romp with some spectacular action scenes.
Laser sharks Vs Crabs 3D accidentally does more for gay pride than every film made before its existence...
This is some absolutely fucking ridiculous cheese, the most camp thing I have seen in a long time. Your standard superhero bloated bullshit but filtered through the likes of Star Wars, Power Rangers/Inframan, Indiana Jones/Tomb Raider/Uncharted/Tintin, every saturday morning cartoon you can think of and a bunch of other weird stuff. I can't lie, I kinda enjoy this...
After a shaky introduction involving Nicole Kidman & Temuera Morrison, 'Aquaman' bursts into life with the appearance of Jason Momoa. The charisma and commitment that he brings to the role really compliments the material. His interactions with the supporting cast are sublime and his psychical presence adds a sense of legitimacy to the set-pieces. Unlike with the character's parents, I believed the chemistry between Arthur & Mera. Whilst Momoa does most of the heavy lifting, Amber Heard does a very good job of complimenting his performance. In fact, I think it's safe to say that this is her finest role to date.  Patrick Wilson & Yahya Abdul-Mateen II provide strong villainous turns. Similarly to Michael Shannon's, Zod they both have a strong motivation that you can sympathise with. For a villain to work, I believe that is one of the fundamental aspects and director James Wan understands that.  With so much absurdity taking place on screen, industry veterans, Willem Dafoe & Dolph Lundgren do a terrific job in helping to endorse the world of Atlantis. 'Wonder Woman' composer, Rupert Gregson Williams' pulsating electronic beats guide us through this magnificently constructed underwater landscape. Borrowing heavily from 'Blade Runner 2049', 'Jupiter Ascending', 'The Abyss' & 'Pacific Rim' (to name a few), Wan wears his influences on his sleeve whilst simultaneously bringing something fresh to the screen. It's the sort of visual extravaganza that makes you want to freeze-frame certain sequences and observe all the minuet details that dwell in the background, capitalising on every cent of it's $200 million budget. With the aid of fight choreographers, Wan demonstrates a natural gift for shooting action. As someone who has grown increasingly frustrated with the lack of light and reliance on shaky cam, I really admired how 'Aquaman' chooses to go wide seamlessly cutting together footage in order to create the illusion that it was shot in one take. It makes the combat scenes feel more visceral and it's great to see what is actually happening.  Featuring some witty one-liners, the film doesn't go overboard with it's humour. Despite having a sense of ridiculousness the film remains grounded and doesn't feel like a cog in the corporate wheel. After the mishap that was, 'Justice League' hopefully Warner Bros. are learning not to rely so heavily on connectivity. The fact that they were willing to release an unedited 143 minute cut theatrically suggests that they may be learning from past mistakes.  After suffering from tentpole fatigue, 'Aquaman' is the kick up the ass that I needed in order to reinvigorate my enjoyment of this franchise. I admired the preposterousness and devoured the world building. As an indication into the future of DC, I'm back on board. James Wan has done a terrific job of realising this character and I really hope that he returns for the sequel.
Aquaman is a bloody good time at the cinemas. It's hella cheesy but it's also extremely fun
this is the most crackhead shit ive ever seen
genuinely only good when nicole kidman is there, the rest was just okay at best. the script was often laughably cringe and would definitely have benefitted from being trimmed down quite a bit but overall....... fine.  side note: WHAT THE HELL WAS ANNABELLE DOING JUST CHILLING AT THE BOTTOM OF THE OCEAN???
Damn, the best DCEU film since... fucking Man of Steel?
can't wait for aquaman 2: desolation of seaworld
Okay, personally here's my take on the DC vs Marvel films. DC is not Marvel and Marvel is not DC. DC has it's own way of telling stories, wherein the DC universe goes for the serious, dark, and grand ways of story-telling/scenes, whereas Marvel goes for the light-hearted, humor-filled, fun method. The thing is, most people will go for the fun ones, which is unfortunate for the DC Universe. From my take, they are trying to stick with reality--on what is a most likely scenario[s] if super heroes do really exist. As for the film itself. I liked it. I'm not a film enthusiast to explain the technicalities nor even noticed them, but I'm a casual movie go-er, and this is how I experienced it. Anyhow, It felt like they went overboard in some of the scenes, but those are scenes I liked the most. I've always had a difficult time trying to choose which super hero I like the most, like how kids will fight over which supers they want, how some people are a fan of Batman (I know a couple of friends), the Flash (my brother), and Captain America (online friend), while I couldn't decide which. Now I know which super I like, and it's Aquaman. <3
honestly the first half of the film i was bored and wasn’t enjoying it, but the second half really picked up. jason mamoa is the absolute perfect casting for aquaman. and i haven’t seen much of amber heard before, but she was really great here, easily one of the best parts of the film and i will definitely be looking out for her in other films. one big negative for this film for me is the cgi, i feel like considering where we are in time, and when you look at other films that have come out recently it really wasn’t very good. not the best film of the year by a long shot but overall i enjoyed it.
Great movie. Unfortunately the soundtrack is kinda poor compared to the greatness of the story. The villain has such a good motivation that you can easily relate to him and it really adds a lot to the whole movie. Also, the interactions between the Aquaman and the other characters are well-developed. Really good
While it’s visually stunning and appealing, the main weight of the movie isn’t felt due to the lack of conflict and stakes. The antagonist is weak with unclear motives that doesn’t drive the movie forward but hinders the movie from going anywhere deep or special. Jason Momoa as Aquaman while being a master at the art of action as a character still needs to work on the humor aspect. The 3rd act was underwhelming and yet again another CGI battle sequence for the sake of having a CGI battle sequence. Aquaman is a one time watch, breathtaking visualls but lacks the sense of being a movie.  To quote a friend, “Black Panther but instead of race its about environmental issues”
I was so hyped for this movie that I was afraid my expectations where so high I would end up being disappointed. But no, I had so much fun watching this. Nicole Kidman as Atlanna was so beautifully done, the first 10 min are so pleasing, and Yahya Abdul-Mateen II as Black Manta was another highlight for me. Amber Heard is perfectly cast as Mera. It's like all these characters jumped out of a comic. When Aquaman dons his costume it is truly magnificent. If you are a comic book fan you really appreciates what they have done with it. The movie is a lot of cgi but all nicely done. Atlantis is stunning just like the vehicles and all of the creatures. The costumes are magnificent. All the action scenes are marvelous, the ones under water and the ones on land. It is something you haven't seen before. The final battle was a little bit too much for me because I didn't really see the point of it but besides that everything was eye-candy. The score of the final trailer is not in the movie, too bad because it is one of the most epic movie scores out there. So lets explore Atlantis and the other kingdoms more because we saw too little of them and bring on Aquaman II
naming my first born after james wan
not amazing but very fun
pros:  - nicole kidman as Queen Atlanna - nicole kidman kicking ass - nicole kidman cons;  - everything else
If Nicole Kidman was my mom and she got deserted, I'd have revenge and try to become the king of the ocean too bitch.
Was only watching this for Jason Momoa, but damn- Nicole Kidman kicks some ass! And I do love some Willem Dafoe! Some corny scenes and lines of dialogue, jokes and gags that were hit and miss, but that was to be expected.  Watched this on Screen X and was pleasantly surprised.
10/10: Hats off to director James Wan. He can create a world and tales of various genres - adventure, love, superhero, action, horror and epic battles all in a single movie!!! Finally a movie that not only DC fanboy deserves, but everyone, even for the non-comic fans. Beautiful cinematography, visuals, costumes designs and bad-ass villains. One of the best movie in 2018!
Campy in all the right ways that Captain America: The First Avenger (and uhm Suicide Squad) wasn't. Also, Patrick Wilson is always always great, Amber Heard is stunning, the CGI looks straight from a video game (jarring initially but kinda cool halfway through), the stunt choreography is excellent, Arthur finally doesn't come across as buffoonish as he did in JL, the dialogue is incredibly cheesy at most points, it's kind of like the reverse Black Panther, but god damn was it fun.
An absolute blast: fun, goofy, absurd, and about five different films stuffed into one green and gold outfit. I want a sequel that is just Arthur & Mera: Action archeologists.
The King has Risen. Aquaman is a huge cheesy spectacle that you don't want to miss. A visually stunning of a film with a little bit of everything; Adventure, Fantasy, Romance, Horror, Comedy, and Action. Not only this film shows you the beauty of the deep blue sea, it also features how terrifying it could be. Certainly doesn't disappoint. James Wan delivered more than what we expected. In Wan We Trust, indeed.
Mad as a box of frogs but it’s fun
Now I understand why we should appreciate Kokoh Wan.
Pure entertainment. Aquaman overcomes a clunky narrative and cliched dialogue with terrific action scenes, especially those taking place underwater, that benefit a lot from fluid camerawork. The IMAX 3D is a bit murky, but the fact that roughly 80% of the scenes were filmed in IMAX’s expanded aspect ratio makes it completely worth it. This is another win for DCEU, which I believe is on the right track to resurrect itself following the Justice League debacle. James Wan finally makes Aquaman a “cool” superhero worthy of standing alongside Wonder Woman, not a useless dude who got his ass kicked in most of his own scenes in Justice League. The movie finds the charm in its leads. Momoa as Aquaman has more charisma than Cavill and Affleck as their respective characters combined. His hair-flip is already more memorable than them. Amber Heard and Patrick Wilson got some awful lines, but they’re good. Nicole Kidman has this ethereal aura that makes her casting perfect. Could’ve been about 20 minutes shorter. It honestly felt like 3 hours. But boy did I have a blast! The underwater duel between Arthur and King Arm in the middle of the movie and the climatic battle are some epic stuff. Overall a decent film. Makes me excited for DCEU again. 2018 releases ranked
Best DCEU movie so far. Eventough the CGI is shit, the story and the message on it really are that good. James Wan also did not lose his horror's identity and succeed on putting a little bit horror sense to this film through the score. A job well done !
Everything in this movie is fucking hilarious, the best dc film by far :))
If not for the atrocious dialogues, totally misplaced music choices and some bad editing that ruined some really good action choreographies this could have been a lot better. The visual effects were great, Jason Momoe was charming, Amber Heard had a pretty good role and Patrick Wilson and his character was not utilised enough. The tone of the film was all over the place but it was entertaining throughout the runtime.
I had a lot of fun with it, it goes for colorful and silly with all it has and the result is a very entertaining and well done movie. I really liked what they did with Black Manta, more than anything the way they introduce him and his conflict with Arthur, and there is also Patrick Wilson, he was quite good as Orm, I don't know that much about him in the comics, but in here a lot of how he is written could of made for a pretty much generic and bland villain, an asshole for the sake of asshole, but Wilson does a lot to add more to him and it makes for a bit more complex and compelling bad guy. The movie actually starts quite well, and with a fast space, is the second act where things stop moving that quickly, going for a more generic quest plot, and its ok but it looses something and is not only momentum. Beyond that, it can be a bit too silly at times, but even then it doesn't really stop being fun, even when it gets awkward. Although it nearly lost me with that Pitbull song, I'm a reasonable man but everyone has their limits. Some things, like the romance subplot are kind of trite, but done ok, as i said, is a well done movie, and part of that, is that it knows when to try to lean into the silly to make something more enjoyable. Despite some fake looking background in the desert bit, the effects are really good, and the look Atlantis and the world under the sea are one of the best things about the movie if not the best, is simply breathtakingly beautiful and you feel the weight of a completely different and massive world. The action is also really good, but thats kind of the point. The movie goes for epic and for spectacle and it manages it quite well, being one of the main reason why I enjoyed it. Sure it doesn't always knows how to balance the silly tone, and in part it fells like DC overcompensating for all the complaints about their past movies and the bleak, joyless tone of them. But the result is not a bad one but actually a really fun movie. It doesn't really tries to be anything else and. as i said before, it goes for colorful and silly without shame, and yes it may not be a perfect or above average superhero flick, but it is a good and fun example of the genre and I'm happy I saw It.
Such a fun film.  The most surprising part was the fact that the tone with this character was very consistent between the films directed by different directors.    Stunning visuals. The underwater sequences, whether it be fights or just conversations looked great.  Characters were well done and all followed the motivations clearly laid out for them from the beginning of the film.
I don't know what more people expect out of dumb, superhero movies.
Aquaman is a movie about a half atlantean named Arthur Curry and this is where it really starts to fall apart. Arthur, despite what this film wants you to believe is not a cool name. it doesn't sound cool when Nicole Kidman says it and it doesn't sound cool when Dolph Lundgren says it. all I could think of was the cartoon aardvark who as charming as he may have been, was not cool. his last name being Curry could go either way but it is nowhere near cool enough to salvage a name like Arthur. you could argue it's an homage to the historical King Arthur and I could argue that his name was uncool too. awful start. also it's ugly and boring and aggressively unfunny and all the character work is painfully dull.
The beginning of the movie was kind of overwhelming, and the resolution part was pretty much '...what, that's it?' Some scenes are just too cringe-worthy, specifically the Arthur-Mera ones.... Nevertheless, the action scene was fairly good to watch. The trench battle was successfully excruciating. I liked the jokes though. 'I could just piss on it' was my favorite.
DC finally got it right, entertainment that people deserve. With Thor 3-style journey and epic battles, I believe in James Wan.
Great action. Decent acting. Looks like a video game sometimes, but in a good way. Fun and entertaining.
The opening to this film instantly throws you into the story, the action, and the worst soundtrack ever I really think they could of changed the music up a bit more, James Wan didn’t do a bad job though the action and fighting in this film was well shot and choreographed. No one was killed of though : (
tbh, gotta admit, one of the better DC films in awhile. I get why people think its shitty but at the same time there is a large audience who will sit in the theatre and truly enhoy this and i get that. The visuals and soundtracks were often captivating despite some odd cuts that most would have probably noticed. A movie to watch with your family and friends but definitely not film critiques. IM JUST PUTTING IT OUT THERE THAT THIS FILM IS PRETTY AWESOME VISUALLY.
I liked this but I don’t know where the rave reviews are coming from. It’s good but it’s not that good. I suppose compared with the DCEU’s other offerings anything good from them will be hailed as a masterpiece.  The action sequences are very enjoyable, the jokes are a little hit and miss and there’s not a single “Mah man!” to be heard, take that as a positive or a negative.  Overall, it’s up there with Wonder Woman, and hopefully Shazam! 🤞 Will I buy it? [inset water based pun that means yes]
say whatever you want about dc films but the scores fucking slap
sluggish and sloppy but very fun.  WOMEN ARE THE GODTIER CREATURES HUH?
This movie is comprised of all the bright colours couldn't find any dull darker colour.
DC did not disappoint with this one, its a visual marvel and a feast for the eyes though, some parts were rushed related to the plot but overall its wonderful.
On land talking about family and searching for lost treasure, while at sea talking about seizing the Ocean Master. Both are combined with harmony by James Wan.
Jason Momoa is born to play this role.
Very good movie with amazing underwater effects. Now when everyone agrees that it's the best DC movie after Wonder Woman, see the similarities in both the movies, both are colorful and vibrant not dark like the other duller DC movies. James Wan definitely made a good movie and it was a very speedy time pass movie. I watched Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse first and then after a small break I saw this movie. Go watch them both they both are worthwhile movies.
This was definitely one of the most captivating movies I've watched in this quarter of 2018. With this year being Marvel's year when it comes to Superhero films, DC needed a lot to catch up on, and I feel like Aquaman hit that note perfectly in terms of what its needed for DC to catch up on. While it had some flaws and inconsistencies when it came to some of the dialogues and plotline, some of the hot moments definitely gave some intense eye candy and distract me from criticizing it as much (👀) Visually though, this just reminds me of how Lord of The Rings would be if it's set underwater. The visuals and graphics of this movie are amazing on all levels and most importantly, it was tastefully done. This is unlike some movies where they would make the CGI look cheap as hell or overdo it. The various sea creatures that made its appearance in the film felt realistic as well. Another aspect that made me happy was the portrayal of Aquaman in this movie as well. Over the years, Aquaman has always been counted as a joke in various media outlets and his character has always been downplayed. But this movie showcased a different side of him to a wider audience and a more serious (yet still fun) side to him as well. This is definitely the best DC movie since Wonder Woman, which was back in 2016. Although that's not saying much, it shows that the DC universe is still somewhat redeemable. This gives me hope for more DC movies to come, especially with Shazam!, Birds of Prey and Wonder Woman 1984.
for me, it's one of DC comics best movies yet (but not better than Wonder Woman). the movie started bad but it's getting better during the second act and the third act it's the best and you finish the movie with a great feeling and reconsiders all the script fails and the bad acting from the main characters.
Redheads, you gotta love em!  just when i thought the scene where arthur and mera emerge from water to the tune of ocean to ocean.mp3 was the sexiest moment in cinema 2018, the wine scene came in and so did i   this was off to a mediocre start but it progressively gets So Much better and the visuals were stunning. the concept of people riding seahorses was bonkers but boy we sure love to have fun. i almost yelled “I THOUGHT THIS MOVIE WAS ABOUT FISH RIGHTS” when nicole kidman swallowed a goldfish.   also....... miss amber heard i’m free on tuesday night if you wanna go for a swim drink wine maybe idk i’m free call me
What an epic apik aquashow for an Aquaman.
Most of the dialogue in the first hour is unnatural exposition. Words fly by. Many, many words. "Ocean Master"? But James Wan can film a fight scene. But don't expect anything particularly original. But a lot of it looks really cool. Really, really cool. and James Wan can film a fight scene. Pretty reasonable environmental message. I stuck around for the credits, and it turns out there were a few digital effects... I kind of loved it...
AQUAMAN is a epic adventure with great characters and a markable script. the visual effects are INSANE, and i’ve never had seen something like this since the lord of the rings and avatar. momoa, heard, kidman, wilson and dafoe are great together. the production design is beautiful, and james wan directly this film very well. the only problem for me was the soundtrack - sometimes, during a dramatic scene, a stupid teenager song starts in the background. i love it, congrats dc!
Old fashioned superhero tale with infectious energy. Meaty and gigantic action. A high watermark for the DCEU.
nicole kidman and amber heard just said the future is women!
The entire movie was about Jason Momoa finding a thing (a treasure), but he doesn't realise that he is the real treasure to us.
Acid trip underwater (above the water as well). It is both completely earnest and ridiculous; but it looks and feels like a comic book. Great cast too. I had too much fun to care about "flaws".
everybody say thank you amber heard and nicole kidman
This movie is crazy. Completely bonkers and all over the place. Very entertaining! It is a lot of fun and has amazing special effects, with great action sequences. It doesn't take itself too seriously, and knows how ridiculous it is, but still manages to get across an important environmental message without being too heavy handed about it. The score is good, and helps the movie feel more epic, but there are some questionable choices in terms of use of pop songs. I would say that the dialog isn't great, and there are so many action sequences that you never really get time to breath or to get to know the characters. This movie is really non-stop action! Overall, I would say it's a very fun watch, definitely to be seen on the big screen!
my main takeaway: jesus can turn water into wine but amber heard can turn wine into flying knives
Throughout the movie I can't help but think that this movie is actually a reverse-Black Panther. It's almost the same: both are about an outsider who have came into the kingdom to try to take the crown from the reigning king. The difference is that in Black Panther, that outsider is the villain and lost, while in Aquaman that outsider is the hero and won. I haven't watched Thor, but I suppose there are similar elements there too as well? Is that how kingdom-themed movie works? Anyways, I think Aquaman is amazing and enjoyable, much more than Justice League. I kinda prefer this than Wonder Woman too. I'm glad that they gave some comedy to Arthur's personality. Mera is a badass, love her hair, I think she's the most vibrant female character in any superhero movie I've ever seen. Overall this movie is refreshing. Oh and that giant crab reminds me of that giant crab from Moana who was voiced by Jemaine Clement. I kinda expected him/her to sing "Shiny" at some point in the movie.
Aquaman is a colorful and well actions packed movie. The casts are good, audiences will definitely get captivated by Jason Momoa’s charisma, Amber Heard’s beauty. James Wan is great, he has integrated those good elements in his previous film: epic single-shot action sequences and even some of horror elements into this movie. Although it is 145min movie, but you will never feel bored, it’s entertaining with adventurous plot. For the cgi aspect, it gives us the most vibrant underwater world, however people will getting tired with the use of too much of cgi. Another downside of this movie are some of dialogues are too common which we can found in rpg games and the Princess Hera role, I just felt a bit weird as she just leaving King Orm and goes with Arthur, also is the one who potentially be the king of Atlantis.
A bit disappointing to be honest. Good action scenes as you'd expect but felt forced in the majority. An octopus playing a drum really took me out of it.
The lows were so low, the highs were so high Visually spectacular, magnificent world building, the action is really well directed and for the amount of CGI, not that heavy handed, some moments were pure adventurous joy and shiver, the humor almost NEVER landed, the dialogue and acting is slender man bad In the end i really love this and was very sad that the horrible dialogue and humour prevented this to become a instant classic
So this movie was… decent? Good? Entertaining? Well that's unexpected. Let me start by saying, that I have a strange relationship with the DCEU (or whatever the nam is) Batman v Superman was a convoluted mess, Suicide Squad was on of the worst movies I have ever seen, Justice League was a clash of thirty visions. And I'm in a minority, when I say, that I find Wonder Woman boring. The only other movie I liked in this series so far was Man of Steel. Aquaman is a nice change of pace and tone. After the slow and dark entries preceding it, it's a quick and lighthearted adventure, that doesn't take itself very seriously. Which is good thing for a movie about a guy, who talks to fish. The visual effects are nice, although sometimes not perfect. It's not as bad as Justice League though. There is colour and even when the CG is bad it's never awful. And Atlantis looks gorgeous. The performances are all fine. Jason Momoa is very likeable and charismatic and I buy him as Arthur Curry/Aquaman. He sold even some of the more corny dialogue. The rest is good. Willem Dafoe is always a plus, Amber Heard was fine, Patrick Wilson's Ocean Master was a pretty decent villain. The guy who plays Black Manta (sorry, I don't remember his name) was good, but other people seem to like him more than I do. If they bring him back for a sequel, he could be even better. Aquaman is a movie with a story we have seen done before, with archetypes we have seen before. I, however, didn't mind that. It was entertaining and it wasn't trying to be much more (ehm, BvS, ehm). I will watch this one again for sure.
There is no denying that Aquaman is a damn fun visual spectacle of a superhero action adventure film even if its a flawed one. Its worth watching on IMAX for its fantastic underwater visual effects and action sequences alone. A lot of visual imagination is put into the underwater city of Atlantis. The action sequences are beautifully shot and you have a lot of different action set pieces that are a marvel to watch at the big screen. Aquaman is an ambitiously large scale film, that tries to go through a lot of world building and backstories. Even at 2 hours 22 minutes, it feels like the film rushed up some of it by mere exposition to save time. The large scale nature of the film makes it feel a bit messy at times even if its basic story is simple. The age old story of two brothers fighting for the throne one may have seen or read multiple times. This one done in a reverse of the way Black Panther did. Jason Momoa is perfect as the macho hero and has his roguish charm that carries the film. Amber Heard as Mera is jaw dropping smoking hot rocking the red hair sharing a nice chemistry with the hero. The climatic final battle is pretty epic. Comparisons to Avatar are warranted in regards to its CGI and world building. Its kinda sad and ironic that the Aquaman movie in DCEU feels the more grander and epic than Justice League.
As of late, the films featured in the DC Extended Universe (DCEU) have received a lot of criticism. Only ‘Wonder Woman’, which was released last year, has been successful in terms of praise from both critics and audiences. ‘Justice League’, which was released at the end of last year, was poorly received and didn’t impress at the box office. Because of this, the upcoming release of ‘Aquaman’ left many doubtful if it would be any good. However, since its release, it’s received mostly positive reviews from critics who were pleasantly surprised. We first saw a glimpse of Jason Momoa’s Aquaman (real name Arthur Curry) when he made a cameo in ‘Batman V Superman: Dawn Of Justice’. He then appeared in ‘Justice League’ where we saw more of him in action, however, we didn’t know much about his background. While ‘Aquaman’ is set following the events of ‘Justice League’, we see glimpses of Arthur’s life as a child and how his parents met. Because his mother, Atlanna (Nicole Kidman), was the Queen of Atlantis, and his father, Thomas, was human, their relationship was forbidden and, not long after Arthur’s birth, Atlanna is forced to return to Atlantis. While ‘Aquaman’ isn’t a perfect film, it is entertaining. Those who haven’t seen any of the previous films in the DCEU needn’t worry as it works as a stand-alone superhero film. The story focuses on Aquaman and none of the other superheroes make appearances. I think that, prior to its release, people were expecting ‘Aquaman’ to be another disappointment, like ‘Justice League’ and ‘Batman v Superman’, however, it proved to be a pleasant surprise. Unlike the aforementioned films, ‘Aquaman’ isn’t trying to be a serious film and has a light tone to it. It’s just a lot of fun and is one of those films you can just sit back and enjoy. Momoa proves to be a great choice to portray Aquaman as he brings charisma to the role and makes him a likeable protagonist. He is also impressive in the fighting sequences and captures the strength. Solid supporting roles come from Kidman as his mother, Amber Heard as Mera, who is an Atlantian and Arthur’s friend, Willem Dafoe as Nuidis Vulko, Atlantis' counselor who would become a mentor of Arthur Curry when he first comes to Atlantis, and Patrick Wilson as Arthur’s half-brother, Orm, the current ruler of Atlantis and the main antagonist. The performances aren’t Oscar-worthy but that’s to be expected with a superhero film, however, the cast give solid performances. The films in the DCEU have been criticised for its reliance on computer-generated imagery (CGI), however, the visuals for ‘Aquaman’ are impressive and effectively bring the world of Atlantis to life. On filming underwater sequences, the director, James Wan, stated that "the underwater world is super complicated" and "it's not an easy shoot". Because of the hard work that went into creating the underwater sequences, the scenes set underwater look really good. I think that the problem people make with the films in the DCEU is that they compare them to the films in the Marvel Cinematic Universe which I don’t think they should do as, aside from the fact they’re all superhero films, they’re different in terms of tone and style. The films in the MCU are better, in terms of story, characters and CGI, however, for me, personally, I find the films in the DCEU more enjoyable to watch as they don’t take themselves seriously and are a load of fun. Those going into ‘Aquaman’ expecting something among the levels of one of the MCU films will be disappointed. Prior to watching ‘Aquaman’, I wasn’t expecting much as I wasn’t sure a stand-alone Aquaman film would work, however, I was pleasantly surprised.
Brilliant story great cast and really think they going be aquaman 2
i can't believe that the worst dc cómics character became the fucking best and has the most AMAZING movie. dc, say thank u jason momoa
Finally dc made a good superheor movie. Watching this also remembering me to mcu movies phase 1
amber heard and nicole kidman please step on me
the movie was quite long Jason Momoa a super manly Aquaman, phenomenal! *hats off Amber Heard with her redhead effortlessly stole the show! can't take my eyes off her . The visual effect of under the ocean scenes were outstanding! I stated that THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST DC MOVIE I'VE EVER WATCHED *big applause! 👏👏👏
Before I thought this film could be anymore of a super-entertaining shitpost, a cover of Africa by Toto plays over a scene transition into the Sahara Desert had me fucking wheezing in the theatre. The real question, however, is whether or not that's too big a spoiler to matter but it's more to alert what you're getting yourself into.
great film with an amazing cinematography and fantastic action sequences! james wan has done it again! i love seeing successful malaysians! also is it just me or does aquaman’s suit lowkey look like barnacle boy from spongebob squarepants
This is a totally average film with a few really good action scenes. The problem is that Jason Momoa and Amber Heard are terrible actors and the humour never works. Also, that scene with the pit bull song is the worst thing I have seen all year.
The best movie of the year
You know what? I went in expecting the worst. And it isn't the worst. I mean the script is fucking terrible, don't get me wrong, and some characters are paper thin. Plus the CGI can get a bit too much. But it was entertaining. Jason Mamoa looks like he's having a blast and is easily the best part of it. He's just funny and down to earth. Some of Wan's action scenes are incredibly fun even if reliant on CGI. It's a little too long I'll admit too, it could do with some cutting down, but it was entertaining enough compared to the other DC movies. So yeah, it was alright.
Well this movie was....F U N. Yeah, that’s pretty much how i would overall describe Aquaman, i mean, sure, its super cheesy, it has cringey moments that remind you of early 2000s superhero movies, the dialogue is exposition-heavy and sometimes non-sensical, BUT its also visually stunning, the score gives off cool Tron vibes, Momoa is charismatic as hell, Patrick Wilson is entertaining to watch as he chews the scenery and the action scenes are superbly directed. So yeah, I’d recommend Aquaman, i can’t see anyone not having a blast with this one.
Watched this with my brothers on a Thursday night, which I would regret the following day. The stills in the film are very desktop-wallpaper-worthy. The lines are so bad (e.g., Just call me the Ocean Master) and I feel like the plot, the script, everything would work better in 30-minute episodes of 2D animation.
Why was Black Manta even this lol
Worst thing I've seen in theaters since... Suicide Squad? Why the hell am I not surprised? Shazam will be your last chance with me, DCU.
Directing: 8.1/10 Acting: 8/10 Screenplay/Story: 6.5/10 Cinematography: 7.5/10 Production: 9/10
The action! THE ACTION!  Wooh! the action.
This film cost $350 million, yet it still looks like they got Amber Heard's wig from the bargain bin in Poundland.
Completely ridiculous. Just off the wall nuts. I'm still not really sure what I just watched. It's cheesey yet epic. The cut less fight scenes, the sprawling under water metropolis and practical effect suits are an absolute marvel(hehe) yet the dialogue is so shoddy. All the lore is there and the characters are created perfectly and I really don't think we could've had a more entertaining Aquaman film created by anybody else.
Nothing but high praise for James Wan and the rest of the team for having successfully introduced a formidable addition to the DCEU. Brilliant directing and creative vision that starkly contrasts the previous films in the franchise with Zack Snyder at the helm. I also loved the script, though I did think it could do much better - loved the execution of Chekhov's gun as a narrative device repeatedly throughout the film, plus cool foreshadowing and drawing of parallels as well. My only problem with the film is that it introduced an element of environmentalism on an alarming note but didn't tie up that particular end - I wish that Arthur being hailed as guardian and titular hero of the seven kingdoms could have been shown trying to remedy the grief that humanity has wreaked upon the oceans and seas. It's connected to Mera who slowly learns to acquaint herself with surface dwelling and beauty in the land - but no clear effort to return those sentiments about those who live underwater. Overall though, a solid effort. I hope the success of this film encourages Warner Bros. and DC executives to trust varying, diverse talent in taking charge of solidifying the worldbuilding of the DCEU - it's too glorious and extensive to be placed in the hands of one man alone.
I feel like the character's are still explaining the plot to me....
