Obnoxiously long but the final 45 minutes is some damn fine action filmmaking. Also autobots designed as Nascar stock cars will never not be funny.
I wouldn’t say it’s as bad as the previous transformers film, but this was still bad
While it could have easily shaved off 30 minutes by cutting out the love triangle and the Patrick Dempsey subplot in general, and it does have a lot of the same problems that the last two films had (annoying side characters, a couple bloated action sequences, unfunny jokes, etc.), Transformers: Dark of the Moon is certainly the best of the Bayformers movies as far as acting and directing go (although I still prefer the last film to this one). Bay seems to have much more of a grasp on this one than he did on Revenge of the Fallen, making this one feel much more focused and fun. Shia LaBeouf is also quite good in this one, and it's by far his best performance in these films. The visual effects work is also spectacular as usual, and the action sequences are genuinely exciting, even if they feel a bit bloated. It's not a great movie by any means (or really even a good one), but I think there's enough good here for me to give it a positive review. GRADE: B-
4/10 (Mediocre) I honestly couldn't care less about this film, everything is just meh. At least the first two made me feel emotion, albeit the 2nd one in a bad way. This movie just exists, not terrible but obviously not worthy enough of even an average rating. I didn't mind the majority of things I saw over the runtime of the film, but still nothing noteworthy beyond CGI, honestly.
Let me just say this was an improvement but still not a good film.
The Battle of Chicago is INSANE, but... almost all the action is centered on the humans. The Transformers themselves don’t have as many standout moments as they did in the last movie. Some of them barely make their presence known. Shia LaBeouf continues to be great (his story about finding his place is really good, but it gets dropped too quickly) and the joke are much better than the last movie (there’s way less obnoxious characters too). Sentinel Prime is also a great villain. It’s still a fantastic action movie, but the smaller focus on the Transformers does hurt it a bit. Some of the pacing in the first act is really bad too.
Intelligent, thoughtful, visually unique, emotionally driven, and thematically powerful... is something that this film is not. But it's hella fun. 6.2/10.
“Now, we need a truce. All I want is to be back in charge. Besides, who would you be without me, Prime?” “Time to find out!” Most badass moment in this whole franchise.
Whatever
I can’t get over how shitty CGI JFK looked...
I literally just a few days ago stated I would never watch this film (or the fourth one for that matter), but I didn't realize I would be very bored at the same time FX would be airing it. This is pure garbage. In Bay's defense it is better than the second film, but to be fair 'Revenge of the Fallen' is one of the worst movies I've seen in the last five years. This is just a gigantic, expensive mess. I literally have nothing else to say. Just terrible.
While the first installment still manages to capture the spectacle of the giant robots better, Transformers: Dark of the Moon is entertaining enough in its second half to make up for weak characters and unnecessary subplots.
Dark of the Moon is bad film but, it’s kind of watchable.
It's often shocking to me to see really, truly great actors in movies this bad. Paycheck, I guess? The thrill of acting to a stick with a tennis ball on it?
I spent money to get this shit at redbox why was young me so stupid
I don’t know why, but I like this one a little better than the last one. I find the tie in with the moon landing interesting, even though they don’t really go that far with it. Sentinel Prime is probably the most compelling villain so far, but that’s not saying much. There are some nice looking battles, the freeway fight, and the Chicago building collapse in particular stands out for me. This one feels like it tries to build on the mythology more, delving further into the war on Cybertron and what each side wanted out of it. Also, I know he’s crazy now, but in this and the last two movies, Shia is actually entertaining. Not everything out of his mouth is a crude joke, there’s actually some wit(wicky) to what he is saying. But hey, look – here are those things again. An attractive female lead whose ass is hanging out the second we’re introduced to her? Check. Thinly sketched new Autobots with specifically human accents or physical attributes? There’s Japanese robot, Einstein robot, and British robot with a gut. Check, check and check. Juvenile humor? I can’t even remember but probably check. Also, Optimus Prime is a straight up brutal murderer in these. However, I don’t know if it’s just the sound of Peter Cullen’s voice, but he never fails to deliver an epic sounding declaration right after the chaos abruptly ends. You cut to the credits ALMOST thinking, man, that Optimus is a hell of a leader. Once again, this is just shallow texture in place of real characterization.
Shia LaBeouf’s character, whose name I still do not remember despite marathoning these movies, seems like the kind of dude who’d complain about affirmative action. I’m sorry your Ivy League education (that your parents paid for) and your presidential medal weren’t enough to land you a job. Maybe you should have done a N.E.S.T. internship or something.
Slightly better but not good fighting robots
Really enjoyed it the battle was unique and the acting is killer. 2nd favorite transformer film.
It's the first time i needed to get smashed to finished a movie and tbh even after that i still think it's not a good movie.
None of the positives of the first one. Just mind numbing action
It ain't getting any better. Mrs Statham really makes you miss the acting skill of Megan Fox.
Relies on caricature and spectacle, but it's the movie that Battle: LA was supposed to be.
Checking off the highest grossing films list is going to be mind numbing.
You guys ready to hate me?  I’m about to GO IN and rate a ton of movies I’ve seen but not logged- and will potentially never watch again. If I have any thoughts on the film, I will put them here:  Sorry for the spam!
What the fuck are these films? Michael Bay is so talented at creating on screen chaos - there's nobody out there creating insane fight scenes like those we see in the third act of this film - and he's proven with films like Bad Boys and The Rock that he can make a film with a straightforward, easy-to-follow narrative, so why is this so messy? The editing is so fucking jarring, and the pacing is so rushed during the first half of the film, yet it slows down for the second half which is basically one long battle. I don't think I've ever seen another film that seems so eager to get the build up out of the way so that it can move on to the good stuff. The hour long Chicago sequence in this film feels so much like it's just Michael Bay playing with his toys, and the rest of the story is just the perfunctory set up to explain why everyone is there and why they have to fight. Who is this film for? It's 2 1/2 hours of incoherent plot, with acclaimed actors screaming at each other and giant robots brutally murdering each other; how did this possibly make over a billion dollars? It's a mean film, full of casual murder and cruelty, and yet it's silly nonsense about fighting robots: you'd think that would only appeal to a small subset of people, but apparently not! I get the feeling that Michael Bay enjoys making the technical side of these films (the stunt work is absolutely insane) but at the same time hates his audience and is making this series as a big "fuck you", which would explain why they seem to get increasingly incoherent and messy as the series goes on? "Want to watch robots blowing stuff up huh? Well fuck you, if you want that you'll have to try following this story you bitches!" I think I liked it? I admire the sheer level of technical skill on display, some of the action scenes are incredible, and I actually quite like Shia LaBoeuf as the lead (Mark Wahlberg is a poor, poor replacement) as well as some of the supporting cast, but Rosie Huntingon-Whitely is really bad! The pacing is so jumpy and jarring, and there's such a miniscule amount of story at the centre of this that's it's hard to get invested; you feel like you've been stranded in the middle of Michael Bay's overactive imagination. These films and their success are honestly kind of fascinating, and I'm really curious to see how they're looked back on in the future. P.S. The human bad guy, who betrays humanity to the Decepticons, lives in Trump Tower. Michael Bay was so far ahead of the game with his political commentary!
suddenly I hate cinema
michael bay as a 9/11 truther. government conspiracies stacked on top of one another, also might be the closest i’ve seen him come to liberalism considering his usual patriotic slant. movement characterized as chaos. this is obviously trash cinema, but that doesn’t change the fact that bay puts more thought into his cgi compositions than almost all of these other blockbuster filmmakers.
The fact this lifeless film has such an amazing supporting cast boggles the mind.
Hear me out. The action is incredible, and it doesnt feel like a "shower me with cgi, I am a dirty pig" type of action. The movie is long, so watch it with a pizza or some other food like chicken wings or chicken tenders, get them spicy and really wet so you can lick your fingers to the bone. (Wash your hands afterwards, maybe you get a hot date and you don't want no stinky spicy fingers my homie). Okay, T3. It's just stupid fun, have a good time, eat food, enjoy the film for what it is.
Dark of the Moon is definitely an improvement over the previous film. The CGI and sound design are once again amazing. Unfortunately, the film is overlong, the story is thin, and the acting needs improvement. That being said, the last hour of the film is basically one long action sequence with some of the best action in the franchise.
Megatron goes from being the most dominant and powerful Transformer in the franchise to being one-shotted by Optimus. Fuck this movie.
The ineffable charm of Sam Witwicky. One of my most anticipated rewatches. Particularly followable (for better or worse), but Bay’s direction remains anything but obvious.  Edit: the morning after, I find myself with a fatigued eye
Only slightly less insipid, annoying, and convoluted than its predecessor. 3/10
Out of touch and confusing. The only thing that keeps you in the cinema are the action sequences.
I don’t think I understood a single thing that happened ?? Also why does it have to be 2 and a half hours long 😩
The thing I find absolutely fascinating about Transformers movies is how obviously evil Optimus Prime is. He's so clearly secretly trying to conquer Earth. Its nuts!
the skyscraper scene where they are flying all over the place literally is some of the craziest shit i’ve seen in any of these big budget cgi porn movies also adding tyrese shines as the comedic relief in every role he’s in... which i think is just fast and furious movies and this franchise.
Another great explosive movie. Good watch.
Optimus is a fuckin S A V A G E!
I really want to like these movies, but I don't. As eye candy, they look good, but they're shot so kinetically you can't see the eye candy. Okay, so, the Space Race was really because a UFO crashed on the moon, and we need to find out what it was. Fine, but please be consistent. This is how dumb this thing is: the first two movies were all about the All Spark. The Transformers can't fix Cybertron, so the bad guys want to turn all metal on earth into Transformers. Sure but when that doesn't work, Oh! Let's get the thing from the moon we've known was there all this time but have ignored for two movies! Brilliant! So now everyone wants the Matrix of Leadership to reach out through a wormhole to pull Cybertron to earth. Now, why exactly, if that was a possibility, did anyone even bother with the All Spark? Okay, so in the "turn your brain off and watch these things shoot up and blow up those things and eat popcorn" category, the final hour is... sufficient, I guess. Not good, but sufficient. Oh, and what was John Malkovich doing here? He's made out to be a major character, then disappears after 45 minutes? Man, this was dumb.
This franchise should have died after the first film. Yet the second one happened, and so did this pile of garbage.
unlike most people, i would consider this one to be the weakest of Micheal Bay's transformers movies. Now Mind you It is still a damn great movie but there are still some issues i have with it. For example , Ironhide's and Starscream's deaths were not well handled and felt like shock value for the sake of shock value. despite that and the pacing being off in places and some of the characters getting on my nerves or being underdevoloped, there is still alot to enjoy. my favorite aspect about this movie is Optimus Prime. I like that they show how betryal effects him and it is done well.
When people prop up these movies as "dumb fun" I despair at how low the bar for fun has become. It doesn't even feel like Bay had much fun making this. This is a passionless, dull, boring, bloated mess and I do not know why I rewatched it. My one genuine moment of enjoyment was during that bit where Shia yells about his car. Good stuff.
Um... a good Transformers movie??? Directed by Michael Bay??? Really???  Yes, if you are as surprised as I am, I actually do like the third installment of the Bayformers franchise.  No, I'm not high on that pot Shia's mom ate in the last one.  Now granted, Dark of the Moon is still a flawed movie. It still has the Bay-isms that plagued the previous films (the juvenile humor, an inconsistent tone between extremely serious and extremely stupid, an excessive runtime, and a bunch of plot holes, with the biggest being the alien cover ups which somehow go public between acts in the movie for the sake of... plot). The movie also adds an unfunny Ken Jeong, a new love interest for Shia's who technically a better actress than Megan Fox but the emotional weight of the two would have worked better with the original actress making the new relationship feel forced, and predictable plot twists.  So why is it that I enjoy this one when I don't enjoy the other two? Well, for one, it feels like Michael Bay, despite his faults as a filmmaker, actually took the backlash of the last two to heart and crafted at least a somewhat competent movie. Yes, it's stupid as crap, but the action is actually competently made where I honestly enjoyed the robot action and explosions, I found the writing decision to connect Transformers with conspiracy theories like Apollo 11 and Chernobyl hilarious yet kind of intriguing, Shia LaBeouf actually has a legit arc I somewhat cared about in this one (despite a stilted romance that works but kind of doesn't as I already mentioned), enjoyed the small appearances of John Malkovich, Frances McDormand, and ALAN FREAKING TUDYK (man that guy's underrated), and then there's Leonard Nimoy who provides his voice to the mysterious Sentinel Prime. Holy crap, is this one amazing character! Honestly, they should have made a movie solely with Nimoy's Autobot while he was still living and I'd be blown away simply for the casting choice. I can't talk about too much because Sentinel's development revolves spoilers, but let's just say it was refreshing to see a different side of Leonard Nimoy, even when he's voicing a CGI robot.  Man, I miss Spock!   Anyway, Transformers 3 is a watchable Transformers movie that has enough schlocky fun to satisfy my action cravings, even with many, many flaws. Easily the best of the bunch so far for Sentinel Prime alone.    66/100     "The needs of the many outweight the needs of the view." Wait a minute, I've heard Nimoy use that line before...
After the utter disaster of Revenge of the Fallen, we come to the final film in the Shia LaBeouf trilogy that, while a massive improvement over 2, still doesn't quite beat the first film or even Age of Extinction personally. To be fair, this is a lot better than the second film. The pacing remembers to slow down every once in a while, someone reminded Michael Bay what a tripod is so the camera isn't constantly shaking around, Sentinel Prime makes for a much better villain than the Fallen, buoyed by a legitimately good performance from the late Leonard Nimoy, and they managed to make Optimus Prime on a jetpack actually awesome this time. However, many of the problems with the first two films are still very much present here. There is still far too much focus on the human characters, complete with an entirely useless human bad guy this time around. The Decepticons' designs still aren't distinct from one another at all, to the point where you probably wouldn't even know that Barricade from the first one is in this movie unless you looked it up on the Transformers Wiki like I did. The Battle of Chicago sequence is basically just a shittier version of The Avengers, and this film starts Optimus Prime down the path to becoming a murderous asshole in 4 and 5, even if him killing Sentinel is more or less justified. So yeah, Dark of the Moon, better than the last one, but it's still a Transformers movie. Onto Age of Extinction! Side note: It took me until this particular viewing of these movies to fully realize how utterly pointless Josh Duhamel's character is.
Same old action, beyond 0 plot. 40/100
I lost the will to live approximately 154 times during this movie but never more than when actual fucking Buzz Aldrin showed up to congratulate one of Michael Bay's big dumb robots for being an American hero
This film is one of the rare cases in this segment where we will say that the film deserves the bad score it got, but we still dig it. Great action, ridiculous moments, goofy characters: what more do you want?
The action is just awesome here, plus Rosie Huntington-Whiteley is gorgeous that glass building being shredded by Shockwave is a perfect example of VFX done right !
8/10: Great
(Old impressions, not based on a recent viewing) I saw this in the theater with my friends and as the final fight was ending, my friend remarked "all that is missing is a shot of an American flag" and ten seconds later, that's exactly what happened: the camera tracked back and a somewhat burnt American flag entered the shot.
I liked the first Transformers film but the sequels I’ve endured have all been shite!
Dark Of The Moon is a huge improvement over revenge of the fallen. It’s by far the second best in the series.  The performances are much better in this one. The plot isn’t all over the place like it was in the previous film. The action is pretty great in this one too.  And of course the special effects are really good. Although the first half of this movie isn’t that great. It’s not interesting and a bit boring.  Sams new girlfriend is okay at best. Her performance is actually decent if I’m being honest. But Chris Stuckmann said in his review for this movie that they should have let Sam be single.  And I agree completely with that. We didn’t really need another girlfriend for Sam to deal with and Scream her name in the final action sequence. The last half of this movie is just all action and it’s so cool.  But this movie didn’t have much of an ending. It just sort of abruptly ends. There is no end of trilogy goodbye here.  Overall Dark of the Moon was a hell of a lot better than I remember it being. I actually quite enjoyed rewatching the film.  One more movie to go in my rewatches of the Transformers films and then I’m done. I’m not reviewing the 5th one considering I already have. And plus I hate that movie so there’s that.  Grade: B-
This film was okay, but nothing more. It was way too drawn out and the action was pretty boring. The first half was much more entertaining in my opinion. Since I only heard bad of these films I was expecting this to be terrible but it really isn't. The writing decent enough and so is the acting. I also really like Shia Labeouf as an actor.
A complete mixed bag. Quality ranges from great to garbage at multiple points. Sam at least has something to do, but the film is bogged down by so many unintentionally silly (albeit badass) moments.
I like how blood thirsty optimus prime is in this one.
After the travesty that is Revenge of the Fallen, it's quite nice to see Transformers go back to being what it should be about: robots fighting robots. OK, so there's still too much attension paid to the human military characters, but at least this time around the human and Transformer storylines are a lot more woven together, so the movie, whilst still about 30 to 45 minutes too long flows in a way that the first two didn't. Rosie Huntington-Whiteley is an appalling actress, though. Clearly only hired so the film could provide some "eye candy" in the wake of Megan Fox's departure, when really the film doesn't need it at all. There honestly doesn't need to be a romantic subplot in films like this, and if you absolutely must include one, then hire an actual actress with actual acting skills, and not a lingerie model with next to no experience. Overall, Dark of the Moon is too long, very drawn out, and in places slightly boring. It's a damn sight better than Revenge of the Fallen though, which isn't hard to achieve, and actually ends up being a fairly good action flick.
Still one of my favorite movies. There are moments where I get goosebumps all over my body.
Firstly i must say that in this movie the special effects are not boring, they are great. The two previous films made the special effects look so boring compared to this film, but luckily this movie changed the direction of the winds. And the action scenes are more powerful than in the previous films The writing has got better too. It's funny and serious just in the right moments. The acting has got better a little bit, but still it's not at the level it should be. John Malkovich is clearly the funniest part in the movie. And this movie has Frances McDormand in it, WAUH! The cast is great! And i am glad that they got rid off Megan Fox. It's very good to get a little bit the back story of the Autobots and Decepticons. The plot is strong and has higher stakes than in the previous films. As a whole this is the only actual good Transformers movie which gets better and better towards the end (well i haven't seen The Last Knight, but i doubt that it would be better than this film, but miracles can happen, who knows). If you wanna see an actual good Transformers movie go and watch this one if you already haven't.
The Transformers movies got exponentially worse as they went on. However this one (initially meant to be the last one) kinda goes all out and so batshit crazy that I can’t help but love it.  Here’s just SOME of the crazy shit that happens - the entire moon landing is revealed to be a cover so we can go to the moon and steal some shit from a bunch of dead Transformers. The Autobots break into a nuclear plant in Not-Iran to star spangled freedom all over them. Alan Tudyk goes Bourne Identity on a bunch of Russian mobsters. A Transformers Vulture turns into a pink Bumblebee and brutally murders an entire family including a little girl. Megatron goes to the Lincoln Memorial, blasts apart Abraham Lincoln with a shotgun, and sits in the throne. A giant Transformer worm eats a building. I could go all fucking day, people.  There’s brief moments of inspiration shining through in this movie that shows what a Transformers movie COULD have been in the hands of a competent screenwriter and director. A lot of the Chicago invasion is actually pretty harrowing and brutal stuff, and really feels like this apocalyptic event is happening (even if they had to force in a melodramatic Linkin Park song). There’s a scene where captive autobots are executed that’s genuinely emotional and feels like something out of a war movie. There’s a shocking and surprising plot twist in this movie that I don’t want to spoil because even now it still kinda throws me for a loop. Even Laserbeak killing a family, while totally insane, is also pretty unsettling and helps sell the Decepticons as a real threat.  However for each thing this movie does that I like, there’s at least one thing I don’t. The story (while thankfully SO much simpler than the last movie) is still another Macguffin Hunt with an event from the past being the main catalyst. Frances Macdormand, god bless her for trying her damndest, is still given a lot of goofy lines and not a lot of depth beyond “interfering government agent”, and John Malkovich was just painful to watch. Some of the transformers are given a little more character development, which is nice, but most of them are still just giant robots with accents in place of personalities (those racist twins from the last one are gone though, thank god).  I know for 2 1/2 stars I’m being overly positive. However, like I said, so much bonkers shit happens in this movie and it gives so much effort towards being bigger and crazier that some of what they throw at the wall sticks and leaves a hell of an impact (also yes I’m biased I’ve been a fan of transformers since a kid fuck off). Optimus gets not one, not two, but THREE “kill them all” moments (the first of which he actually says “we will kill them all”), all of which are fucking amazing and still give me chills. Once again, on a technical level these films are undeniably impressive and the work that ILM and especially the Pyrotechnics teams deserves recognition even if these movies aren’t exactly high art. Or low art. Or pop art. Or really art in general (except that scene with Sentinel and Optimus Prime and the Matrix). If you don’t like the transformers movies then this won’t change your mind on them. Maybe one or two scenes will impress you or make think they were lifted from an alternate reality where the transformers movies are critically acclaimed blockbusters. It’s not a great movie. It’s hardly even good. But brief flashes of inspiration do shine through, and between those brief flashes are moments of such drug fueled madness (with a fair share of filler to be fair) that, even if you’re watching this movie to make fun of it (which is a good way to watch it) you will no doubt be entertained.
그런데 이렇게 길었어야 했냐. But It really have to be long?
Scared me as a kid back in second grade, showed me how cool cgi was.
The only Transformers worth watching.
Gwon megatron (it’s obviously shit)
I don't know why but I'm mildly obsessed with the final battle in Chicago. The rest I can take or leave.
Personally think this one is the best and most memorable but still not the best movie ever. Fun and enjoyable and a little on the darker side in terms of Transformers movies.
I don’t understand why these movies continue to make money. Explosions are fun and all, but this shouldn’t be the standard of filmmaking Hollywood holds itself to.
It’s a minor improvement over revenge of the fallen, it’s at least somewhat watchable and I’ll admit it does have one or two funny moments but I would never recommend this to anybody.
Isn't Transformers supposed to be fun? The first one was, and even though the second one went overboard with the toilet humor, it still had its moments. To this movie's, the story is better and more disciplined, though. The first 20 minutes set up an intriguing premise about the "real" reason for the moon landings. Yet it never really follows through with it. After that pre-title sequence it's back to the usual with Sam and company as they try to stop the Decepticons' latest scheme. For what it's worth, Michael Bay reined in some of his baser tendencies. Sam's parents get a whole lot less screen time, and he ditched the racist Autobots from the previous installment. Also, since he shot this in 3D this forced him to tidy up the camera-work and editing. The visual effects also top everything that came before it. There are some really jaw-dropping visuals that looked amazing on a cinema screen, and still looked pretty awesome on my HDTV. On the casting side, he got some more veteran actors to do glorified cameos and add legitimacy to an otherwise mostly talent-starved ensemble. However, Leonard Nimoy as Sentinel Prime was a stroke of genius along with an obligatory Star Trek quote. What didn't work in the film's favor was the tiresome and endless nature of the carnage and destruction. The last hour of the film is basically an extended action sequence, and it was a chore to sit through. The human drama is clichéd at best, insipidly stupid at worst. Michael Bay certainly doubled down on why the films have been so popular, but it seems like he forgot to make it a little more enjoyable. As a result, lengthy stretches of action were rendered boring and depressing. The score didn't help matters much either. Like the previous two, Michael Bay was content to use the kernel of a good idea and slather it with visual effects and mindless action. He knows his audience, to be sure, but his cynicism is on full display here. Transformers 3 corrects some of the more egregious missteps of its predecessor, but it unfortunately loses its soul in the process.
Great
i really hate michael bay.
The stories get a little more far fetched but the film itself is better than the the previous one...
every week I get together with my buddy Chance to talk all things FAST & FURIOUS - the films, the stars, the drama!! the result is a podcast called PODFAST & PODFURIOUS. you'll never guess how we came up with the name. we upload to Soundcloud twice a week and can be found on iTunes/Stitcher with a simple search for Podfast. Minisodes drop on Tuesdays, while full-length Episodes come out every Thursday. we can also be found on twitter @PodfastPodcast in Minisode 28.5 (31:16) we subject ourselves to a supposedly "controversial" episode of the original TRANSFORMERS cartoon and find it to be imperialist propaganda. this is for kids?! plus, we pitch a potential JOHN WICK knockoff about a Jewish Nazi hunter played by Shia LaBeouf. in Episode 29 (1:08:16) it's Tyrese Time as we rip our sleeves off and rave about Michael Bay's instant classic TRANSFORMERS: DARK OF THE MOON. we're talking LaBeouf's mega-acting, Optimus Prime's bloodlust, JFK's invention of ass-eating and so much more. plus Sean Connery, Elon Musk and Mark Wahlberg stop by the show! it's a barn burner!
I took a one week break from the internet and social media. That is why these titles where not logged correctly. I don't like social media. I had to get away. I am now giving myself permission to go back on, but I don't really want to. Now you're caught up.
"... It's not over."  Megan who?
Slightly cooler Transformers=slightly better than Revenge of the Fallen. Not by much. Not that fun to sit through, but you know, I like that building eating worm thingy.
Flawlesssss!
Flawlesssss!
I don't like to admit that this is the last good one but it's totally the last good one.
Why is this so fucking long
definitely in the bottom half of the transformers film franchise, with plot twists that serve to discredit one of the best transformers characters in order to boost the role of another who before this film and the previous cartoon series was a literal nobody? Leonard Nimoy played Galvatron in the original film so anyone who is a fan would have seen the twist coming a mile away. Megatron sucks and sits around, only really getting good in the last minute before he dies but hey at least he gets to recreate the part in the G1 cartoon where he sits on Abe Lincoln's seat? Starscream and Soundwave go out like bitches, Soundwave by one blast through the chest upwards by Bee, Starscream by Sam Witwicky. SAM WITWICKY OF ALL PEOPLE. Also a lot of high grade actors (particularly those with connections to Coen Brothers movies) started showing up. Frances Mcdormand, winner of the best actress award at the 2018 oscars appears, as does John Malkovich and Alan Tudyk and the asian guy from Community and Hangover (I'm sorry I forgot your name, I loved you as Jerry 'Deep' Wang). This isn't a phenomenon linked just to this film, almost every film in the franchise features someone from a higher class of acting. We all know that Anthony Hopkins was in The Last knight but did you also know that The first movie had Jon Voight in it and the fourth one had John Goodman and motherfucking Kelsey Grammer in it. FRASIER WAS THE MAIN HUMAN ANTAGONIST but more on that at a later date. The only exception may be Revenge Of The Fallen since that just reused John Tuturro but I have a sneaking suspicion that there was someone else involved. Hugo Weaving doesnt count since he voiced Megatron throughout the whole first three films. It does however feature some kinda cool moments, like when Optimus plows through the decepticon horde with his jetpack, slowly losing pieces of it and his guns as he makes his way to Shockwave to finish him off with his Knuckle Dusters. Or when The Driller is eating through the skyscraper to reach the N.E.S.T guys and collapses the tower until Optimus saves the day. The fact that the decepticons actually manage to win for a moment and control chicago is cool and a decent enough plot point but the stuff with the pillars is dumb because they can literally recreate cybertron in under a minute but I do like how when it is destroyed, it resembles Unicron slightly since the whole original idea for the first 3 was to set up and use Unicron but now we might not even be getting him which is a shame since he is my third favourite transformer but then again no one can top Orson Welles performance in the G1 movie. The autobots are mostly boring, the only cools ones do nothing except for the minibots Wheelie and Brains, and once again Bumblebee and Optimus do everything. The decepticons are entirely overshadowed by Sentinel Prime despite bringing in a lot of fan favourites and classic characters, making them entirely expendable and redundant. The humans are a mixed bag, Sam Witwicky is dumb but I prefer his emotional connection to Bee over Marky Mark's 'im an inventor'-isms and bad parenting. Carly is only there to fill the void of Megan Fox and she doesn't really do much until the very end? Josh Duhamel and Tyrese are the same as they always are and Dylan Gould is an interesting idea but one that doesn't work very well in execution. Once again, Optimus Prime's ending film speeches are godlike and definitely in the top tier of emotional motivational speeches, I never grow tired of hearing them, his voice is blissful to my ears and the accompanying Lincoln Park song is beautiful since it gives a farewell to the original 3's use of their music at the end, though Torches, the song played at the end of TLK is just a bit more better and socially acceptable in my humble opinion.   "In any war, there are calms between storms. There will be days when we lose faith. Days when our allies turn against us. But the﻿ day will never come that we forsake this planet and it's people."
Just when I thought it couldn't get any worse than TRANSFORMERS: REVENGE OF THE FALLEN, then comes the third entry in Michael Bay's series. I'm not going to waste my time describing the "story" as it's clear the screenwriters didn't spend more than a minute trying to put something together. The only thing I'll say about the story is that they try to connect our robots to the moon landing in 1969 and claim that Apollo 11 had several secrets. If that sounds interesting to you then it's best just to watch the teaser trailer and leave the rest of the film alone. This introduction only lasts around seven-minutes and then it's back to the brain dead, idiotic, loud and incoherent mess of a movie. It's really shocking that no one has ever tried to come up with a story that you could follow but I guess to Bay as long as you have loud action scenes then nothing really has to make sense. Taking a look at the box office numbers it's clear not too many people object to the horrid mess that this film is. I'm not sure where to even begin but once again I just don't understand the need for a "B" entertainment film to clock in at nearly three hours. It's 154-minutes to be exact but even this is an hour too long. The first thirty-minutes are pure boredom, the next hour has one long, drawn-out dialogue sequence after another and the final thirty-minutes gets to all the action as Chicago is destroyed but by this time I was wishing a real alien invasion would happen and put me out of my misery. This movie is without question one of the worst big-budget movies ever made. The story makes no sense. The comedy is so bad that you can't help but wonder what anyone was thinking. Just take a look at the job interview sequences. Then you have the incredibly stupid parents who are back with even more failed attempts at humor. The performances really aren't any better with Shia LaBeouf really sleepwalking through his part. It's hard to believe that he could have been any more boring as the performance is just downright annoying as is the character. Rose Huntington-Whiteley plays the girlfriend and her performance actually makes Megan Fox look like Meryl Streep. The supporting cast includes John Malkovich, Frances McDormand, Patrick Dempsey, John Turturro and Tyrese Gibson but they too sink in this horrible material. TRANSFORMES: DARK OF THE MOON is just downright bad on all levels. The one saving grace are the wonderful special effects but these aren't enough to save the film.
Slightly more watchable, due in part to the climax, but still a mess of a movie.
I've managed to see all of the transformers movies & can't tell any of them apart.
this movie was so disappointing. the second one is the best and you can't change my mind.
Actually the dark side of the moon doesn't exist lol
unfortunately, i watched it.
No joke I found the robot violence in this is disturbingly gruesome.  Some of the decepticon deaths literally resemble liveleak executions. Still in the hospital so this is what everyone in the common area voted on watching. Their shared enjoyment of the whole affair made me sick for humanity.
I've heard for a long time this was the best Transformers movie. That sounded like faint praise. Okay the whole Chicago battle in the last 30 minutes blew me away. It makes the "good parts" of Pacific Rim look like dog shit and it's a sad reminder of how much Bay no longer cares. The shifting sense of scale and space and the spectacle of destruction is orgasmic. I forgot Bay was ever such a visionary artist. It's such a shame this movie is hilariously too long though. I actually really like all the tasteless appropriation of American history and Andy Daly has a great little part.
Dark Of The Moon may very well be the best in the series up to this point (for what it's worth) in terms of its action and effects, especially during the last third. The problem is that dragging an audience through an hour and a half or more of immensely unlikable characters, lame dialogue, confusing story elements, and Bay's typically obnoxious (though somewhat more subdued this time around) direction makes the overall experience an overly long, tedious chore.
It's almost as if Michael Bay directs some scenes with a boner.  This is a Transformers movie, I don't need the camera ogling the body of your Megan Fox replacement.  Once again this just falls into the trappings of a mindless and uninspired action blockbuster. I still can't fathom how the studio let Bay direct all five. Lastly, what was John Malkovich is in this for? To play someone with a full head of hair? Too say hi to Bumblebee and then disappear for the rest of the movie?
The lame humor of the previous movie is toned down, but this is still a bloated, filler riddled mess. The movie is slow, dull, and drawn out for the first half, then packed with fast cuts and mediocre CGI in the second half. marcfusion.com/2018/07/12/transformers-dark-of-the-moon-2011/
This film is as good as the CGI JFK they create.
probably the worst one iv seen so far
Transformers: Dark of the Moon. Bayhem Marathon.  “We will kill them all.”  I need a friend like Deutch. 2 things: Michael Bay shot this with regular 35mm film and 3D cameras. Having seen this in 3D when it came out, that was an excellent choice. I also remember him and other actors saying that he wanted this ending to be like Black Hawk Down. Something more geographic and have the feel of a war drama. Overall, I think Bay succeeded. There’s still some issues I have with this film. The first half kept my interest, but it was more on the boring than I remember it being. There’s an actual plot in this film, but the whole moon landing stuff doesn’t have that big of an effect as it’s set out to do. Rosie Huntington-Whiteley was very good in Mad Max: Fury Road, but in this film, she’s so hallow. I’m glad she got better because she had no purpose in this film. That’s another thing, there’s several characters who don’t serve any real purpose except to move the plot along, maybe. NOT ENOUGH John Turturro! Patrick Dempsey’s character is a really terrible character and should not be in this film. Also, this might have one of the most abrupt endings of any film that I’ve seen. HOLY CRAP! So, this isn’t a spoiler, the good guys win. They literally leave Chicago in ruins when the Auotbots finally win. Optimus Prime narrates over for maybe 2 sentences and then the film cuts to black. WHAT?! I just wasn’t ready for it to end like that. I thought they’d be a bit more. Like montaging how they’re going to fix the city or work with the US government again and gain their trust back. NOPE! It’s just over. So yeah, wasn’t ready for that. That being said, there’s a lot of great stuff in this film. The first half of this film is a little boring, the other half is batshit awesome! I’m not kidding. For like a straight hour or so it’s nothing but destruction, action, firework explosions, and mayhem! I LOVED IT! It’s exactly what Michael Bay promised. It might possibly be BAYHEM at its finest. CGI, sound design, practical effects, sound effects, and making a film feel larger than life is something Michael Bay does very well. Mad Max: Fury Road will always be my favorite action film, but Michael Bay is certainly the king of action movies. Shia LaBeouf is actually really good in this. Seriously, I really felt for his character at times (the only critic is that his character should have died several chaotic moments). Ken Jeong has one small part in this film. While some find it unnecessary, I always find enjoyment in his little cameo. It’s over-the-top, and I love it. Our new Director of Photography is Amir Mokri. I have to say, he captures the film’s battle sequences very well. There’s so much color but also still shows the gritty action all happening. He did a fantastic job of making the film look good. There’s still a few moments of stupidity throughout the film. Patrick Dempsey and his stupid crusade. Megatron is pretty useless in this. The character Sam is now some expert in parkour and being a badass all of a sudden. Which is strange since a few years ago, he was just in high school. It just doesn’t make since to me for his character. Overall, the first half has a few too many exposition scenes. It’s interesting, but not the most exciting. The second half takes off and never stops until the end. The first film is still the best in my opinion. That being said, this film has the best action of the Transformers Franchise. I really enjoyed it. Fuck the haters. 8.7/10 (A-/A).
I will always be upset that I spent money to see this movie. It's just fucking terrible.
There are script issues to be sure but this is a gorgeous, visceral experience that remains one of 3D's greatest accomplishments; the format made Bay evolve just as Bay made 3D evolve. While I may hold other of his films more closely to my heart I feel confident in saying this film as a whole is Bay's finest achievement.
The third live-action outing for the robots in disguise is, in a rather surprising turn of events, actually the best of the lot. In fact, I’d go so far as to say that it’s almost a perfect modern popcorn flick with only one or two major failings. The first major failing is the overlong runtime (this clocks in at just over two and a half hours) and the second is, although I hate to seem so cruel, Rosie Huntington-Whiteley. People may enjoy criticising Megan Fox but seeing her replacement may end up prompting many to think that she wasn’t all that bad, actually. So, ummm, what’s the plot of this one? Well, it’s actually not all that bad but I don’t want to give anything away so I’ll just say that it involves the space program, a very powerful device that could win or lose the ongoing battle the Autobots are having with the Decepticons, Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf once more) trying to adjust to his new job and reel after reel of impressive, jaw-dropping, action. Like the two movies before it, this film has flaws (and it’s not going to convert those who enjoy despising Michael Bay) but it gets a hell of a lot right and does a lot to make up for the mis-steps of the second film. Love or hate his style, there are moments here that are so epic in scale and so mind-bogglingly complex and packed full of action that you can’t help but admire Bay for his ability to cope with the sheer logistics of such sequences. There is still a feeling of a bit too much being thrown onscreen every few moments but it’s so damn entertaining that nothing depicted ends up feeling like it’s just a pointless flourish. While it’s not like me to disagree with everyone else (ahem!), I’d just have to say that I actually thought the opening moments were amongst the weakest in the film. Recreating the time and events of the space race and putting a Transformers-shaped stamp on them seemed like a great idea, and made for a very exciting trailer, but the faked footage just feels exactly like, funnily enough, faked footage. The story strand it leads into and develops is great but those early scenes remained at their most effective when only glimpsed in trailer form. The action is the biggest draw here but, occasionally, the humour isn’t as bad as it could be. It still doesn’t work, for the most part, but there’s less of it shoehorned in amongst the big battles and the jealousy that Sam feels for his girlfriend’s boss (Patrick Dempsey) is actually mildly amusing. The rest of the comedy, while lame, is at least provided by a number of great names bravely shedding some dignity for the sake of simple entertainment. Ken Jeong has one or two scenes, John Malkovich raises a few smiles, Patrick Dempsey is fun, Alan Tudyk is as fantastic as he always is, John Turturro gets some better material to work with this time round and Frances McDormand makes a great, stern, figure of authority. Kevin Dunn and Julie White get even less time onscreen in this outing but that makes their “comedy schtick” easier to stomach. Josh Duhamel and Tyrese Gibson return in time to kick ass during the second half of the movie and Rose Huntington-Whiteley is, well, terrible. Maybe terrible isn’t the right word. Maybe I should say atrocious or wooden or vapid. But let’s move on. The vocal cast includes Hugo Weaving and Peter Cullen once again but also benefits immensely from the inclusion of Leonard Nimoy. Ehren Kruger provides a decent enough script, with a bit more going on than we had in the first two movies, and Bay directs it with his usual bombastic style. The FX work is pretty damn impressive throughout and it’s easy to just sit back and enjoy the spectacle even when things get a little bit confusing (the manoeuvres performed by the soldiers are quite gung-ho, surprise surprise, and the location of characters during the finale isn’t all that easy to keep up with). It might not completely wipe out the memory of the disappointing “Revenge Of The Fallen” but it certainly tries hard and ends this particular trilogy on a high.
Transformers Dark Of The moon The Fuck
Transformers: Dark Side of the Ass wouldn’t have been an anymore better title but it would’ve gotten comedy points.
This was a solid if decent enough effort. For the most part, the new focused center on the couple isn't all that great since it does tend to go on way too much without the same feeling or realism that they conveyed in the other two. It's all too coincidentally and just there to move the story along which is quite nicely handled here. The action works well, the sense of dread is a lot more prevalent before the twist needed to keep them around which kinda caught me off-guard so their reappearance at the end is quite thrilling and exciting. The battles do have a lot grander sense of finality to them than the others films' so I wouldn't have minded that this does end the franchise actually since it seems to wrap up everything quite well. It does feel a little weaker but there's still a lot of fun to have here.
Overlong, poorly written and filled with Bay-isms. Still has an incredible score though and the battle for Chicago is some damn fine action filmmaking.
Transformers: Dark of the Moon is far better than Revenge of the Fallen, but is still a bad movie. The action is fine, the humans are terribly written, and the film is far too long.
The best Transformers movie, hands down don't @ me.
Business-as-usual here for this third go around. Bay’s style of “film-making” doesn’t change, he is the master of frivolity and Transformers is peak trash. There are more slow-mo action scenes with explosions bigger than a small country here, certainly more than any person without some for M of attention deficit disorder could conjure, so you'll know where you stand with this.  At 2.5+ hours its a long stretch for the uninitiated, but Bay knows how to pull out all the stops to give the viewer a visceral, mind-altering cinema experience with plenty of cheese dolloped on top. File directly under guilty pleasure.
It's a bit dumb but I had a blast. Best movie in the franchise,an epic conclusion of the trilogy. This should've been the end so we wouldn't have got a mediocre T4 or a shitty T5. 8.5/10
Why did I choose to rewatch this piece of crap? Well I've been rewatching all of RedLetterMedia's reviews and this was a movie they reviewed. So I decided to refresh my memory of it. What a mistake that was. At two and a half hours long, this movie is endlessly boring with the final hour of the film being the final action sequence. There's no real character development past Shia LaBeouf wanting to be recognized for saving the world in previous films. Nothing really happens in the first half of the movie. There are some so-called funny scenes with John Malkovich, John Turturro, and Ken Jeong. But I didn't laugh. Most of these characters are dropped by second half. Leonard Nimoy voices a new robot to class the joint up, but he can't. The CGI is endless and crappy. Patrick Dempsey is entirely unbelievable as a villain character. Petter Cullen says vague nonsense. And then the movie hard cuts to credits. What? I've wasted enough words on this. Michael Bay just needs to stop making these. It begins at 1448/1487 Dark of the Moon < Galaxy Quest Dark of the Moon < Because of Winn-Dixie Dark of the Moon < Sisters Dark of the Moon < The Amazing Spider-Man 2 Dark of the Moon > Breaking In Dark of the Moon < The Watch Dark of the Moon < Agent Cody Banks Dark of the Moon < Baywatch Dark of the Moon > The Santa Clause 3: The Escape Clause Dark of the Moon > Let's Be Cops Dark of the Moon < Daddy Day Care It rises to 1437/1487. Yay....?
I’ve come to the conclusion that this is peak Michael Bay and is his only truly great film. It’s the full culmination of what he views as action through a cinematic language. For a while I thought most of the praise for this film on here was just ironic and for some people I still believe their enjoyment of it comes off insincere, but I think I’ve finally zoned in on what makes this work.
Transformers: Dark of the Moon is actually a solid entry in the series. The story is still a mess but is way better than the previous. The human characters are not as boring but are still kind of annoying. The writing is also still pretty bad. The visual effects look amazing though. In the end, this isn't a perfect movie but it's entertaining.
This one I actually like cause it has pretty good characters that hold the story together.  With Explosions and Explosions and Explosions!
"Avengers," but it's worse. This movie has a bad script, screw the acting, suprisingly, I like the score, and the CGI is still better than modern MCU films, which look like older videogames. Man, I am running out of things to say for these reviews.
radiopublic.com/every-movie-ever-G4bm71/ep/s1!c8fac3a1a4d5c73a5adfafe9c4fb461654e2eaf4
this make no sense to me
I never thought I would say this but I missed Megan Fox while watching this. The upside is Sam’s parents are as great as ever. The action in this movie is as good as you would expect from a Transformers movie. Sadly, that means mind bending CGI, lens flares and cameras moving so fast you can’t tell what is happening in an effort to shield you from the CGI madness.
This is the last Transformers movie that I can still follow despite its plot holes. I failed to understand what happened next.
Optimus Primes saves the day part three. Bye Megan.
Maybe it was because I was visiting Chicago for the first time when they filmed this one, but there is definitely a nostalgic lens on this third installment for me. Surprisingly, the filmmakers did much better in almost every fashion. Megan Fox leaving the franchise didn't hurt the trilogy whatsoever and the action sequences actually felt intense and more focused. Honestly, the actors are the worst part of this movie for me. The main character Sam is still obnoxious and simply screams too much. The writing improved, but was not deemed great because of the direction. However, the visual effects are still quite impressive and the new additions were much more noticeable this go around. Overall, it's a fun blockbuster that I can still enjoy at times. Let's be honest, they did the Avengers effects before that movie even did. Worth a rental or casual viewing. I watched this movie on Blu-ray disc.
I truly felt like a worse human being after watching this.
Watch this to hear family guy jokes and gear sound effects
2nd rewatch and I still can't decide if this is a 1/2 star or 5 star film. So for now I'll just stick with 2 1/2. Stay tuned though...
I just... why did they have to do my man Shockwave like that?
The most coherent and least obnoxious sequel to the original
Another battle between the Autobots and Decepticons and humanity and saving the world from destruction! Another Michael Bay fun action popcorn flick!!
I still like this one, I don't care what anyone says.
It seems as though each subsequent film in the series becomes more of a spectacle, and equally more preposterous, but both tend to balance each other out. The Transformers themselves are still visually unappealing, barely distinguishable from one another, don't mesh well with their surroundings, and are generally not particularly believable. The actors tend to be just as bad, with Shia LeBeouf shrieking hysterically, John Turturro being generally unlikable, and everyone else completely forgettable. But, oh, the spectacle! I can't say that watching all the FX carnage isn't some kind of fun. From the car chases, to the ridiculous building collapse, to the one-on-one robot swordfights (really?), the cartoon mayhem is way over the top, and even jumps the rails by adding "blood" sprays to mechanical wounds. I found I didn't particularly care much about the plot - something involving Leonard Nimoy bringing Cybertron to Earth - but the flailing gears, cameos, and Easter eggs were thrown so fast and furious that I hardly noticed I'd lost over two and a half hours of my day.
I completely jumped the boring part. I just wanted to watch action and explosions. The "ignorant" part, to be clearer. Well. I have to admit that I was bored of it after 20 minutes, and I found myself wondering where was the difference between Transformers 3 and The Avengers. Actually, there is no much difference, both in intents and style. But one is spectacularly well done, entertaining and manages to be liked when you are watching it, while the other one is not, and the only thing you would like to do is switch your television off. This is the typical sequel that doesn't say anything, that has completely lost all the verve that was present in the first chapter, just made to gain some more money. From a "hey, unlike me I'm a nerd" movie became a "woo, look how cool I am!" movie. The "best" thing is that they are going to make a Transformers 4 and, Gods be mercyful, also a Transformers 5!
Transformers 3 is the worst movie to have reached the 1 billion dollar gross mark in the history of films. I can't believe people enjoyed that stuff.Literal wads of hot garbage flying around in the air, with no clear idea of where they’re going. Nothing against Shia Labeouf, but man I really wished he would play a role that actually accentuates his talents. Ali’s Rating: C
Leonard Nimoy is great as Sentinel Prime. The rest is whatever.
Frances McDormand has to get at least one more Oscar to amend for this one...
I fell asleep watching this in the theater, and it was in the middle of an action sequence. I think that says enough.
The best Transformers movie still sucks.
I make no apologies for being a Michael Bay and Transformers apologist. However, while Dark of the Moon is enjoyable in patches, it's not a good movie for the most part. With all that said, it features one of the most bizarre sequences I've ever seen put to film, in which a scenery-chomping John Turturro is screaming complete gibberish at Alan Tudyk in a standoff with two Russian babes. Explain that to me... Leonard Nimoy
At its worst, it's excessively violent, painfully long, wastes a whole slew of highly talented actors while also brewing some of the worst performances you can expect in a major film like this and full off horrible, mistimed, awkward humour with weird sexual references. At its best, it's reasonably fun robot on robot schlock. Leonard Nimoy has a good turn as Sentinel Prime, a Transformer with an actual interesting character that gets criminally underused in turn for horses of faceless robots gargling nonsense and getting shot in the head (like the last two, it even has the now accidentally traditional moment where the crew obviously forget which robot is which, shown in this film as one voice is shared between two robots in a scene). The story is relatively simple enough when you look at it, but the film insists on spending 90 minutes setting it up going through more needless conspiracy theories as though you didn't get enough in the previous two, resulting in a bloated and overcomplicated storyline that ends up contradicting the stories that came before it. It's certainly not the worst entry in the Transformers series, but that doesn't make it a good film. There's just enough fun in there for me to scrape a like for it, and that's mostly due to Leonard Nimoy. Oh yeah, and what the fuck is Buzz Aldrin doing in this movie?
I don't mean to sound like biocentric, but when those robots start fighting they all look alike to me.
This is maybe the most amazingly violent and grim PG-13 movie that was ostensibly made to sell toys to children that I have ever seen. A robot vulture assassin disguises himself as a friendly toy robot to get close to his target's daughter before killing him and his entire family. After the Decepticons take over the city of Chicago, we're treated to scenes of cowering civilians being shot and reduced to smoldering piles of bone and tattered clothes. Baby Decepticons are drawn and quartered by Autobots who turn into fully branded NASCAR stock cars. Starscream is blinded by having bombs shoved into his eyes and spends his final moments of life before said bombs blow up his head flailing about helplessly, blubbering about how he can't see. There is an implication that the Decepticons killed JFK. Autobots are lined up in front of a trench while their Decepticon captors prepare to execute them with a bullet to the back of their heads. This movie ends with Optimus Prime going on what could only be described as a "murder jog" through the streets of Chicago, killing any and all Decepticons who dare get in his way. All this is to finally reach and confront his mentor, Sentinel Prime (voiced by Leonard Nimoy), who he has discovered was a Decepticon collaborator this entire time. They have a brief fight that ends with Sentinel getting scalped and begging for his life while crawling on the ground, a request Optimus answers by shooting him in the head with a shotgun from point blank range not once but twice. Then Megatron, having perhaps recently gained some perspective on the hopelessness of the Transformers' endless conflict by the endless horrors surrounding him, approaches Optimus Prime and offers him a peace treaty. In the original script, this offer was genuine, and this version of events survived long enough in the production process to make it into the movie's novelization and comic book adaptation. In the actual movie though, Optimus Prime, without even looking at Megatron, grabs an axe and suddenly swings around so he can bury it deep into Megatron's face. So deep that when he tries to pull it out, Megatron's entire head and part's of his spine come with it. And as Megatron's head hits the ground, the camera lingers on it, his eyes still wide with horror and confusion even as the light quite literally drains from them. Optimus Prime's Autobots and several of their human allies then slowly approach their leader from behind in such a way that suggests the filmmakers know how monstrous Optimus' actions were and that the other characters are appropriately horrified and will call their supposedly fair and just commander out on them. They do not and the credits roll within about a minute. I have only seen this movie once and for better or worse I don't think I'll ever forget it.
