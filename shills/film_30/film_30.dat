"Stevie . . . I haven't slept in a year." The Machinist is strong for the first hour or so. Christian Bale's (Trevor) angular thinness pervades every moment. The film is a washed-out hallucinatory daze brought on by sleep deprivation. It's intriguingly ambiguous and the main cast delivers solid performances. Unfortunately, the back half of the film becomes increasingly self-indulgent and irritating, and it finishes on that note. It's full of interesting details that I wish were in service of a better movie: There's a machine, or commerce, prominently featured in almost every scene; Trevor only has relationships mediated by or adjacent to commerce; and the body horror elements, which make a lot of sense based on the ending. I want the film the first half promises, not the one the second half delivers.
3 1/2 Stars  Best Performance: Christian Bale (duh) Scene Stealer: John Sharian Score: 7/10 Worth Seeing? Yes Rewatch Factor: 6/10 Additional Notes: Wow, this movie was insane.
Same as American Psycho, weird. But I'd have to say it's a great film, the scene on the arcade ride is one of the smartest scenes I've seen in anything. Visually great and adds to the film
Christian Bale is so good in this, but, while I loved this in college, the seams show more now than they did then. It still works nicely as a Dostoevskian thriller, though maybe in a lot more of a straightforward fashion. In the end, it is the Bale show. While this film is mostly famous for him getting skinny, he does manage a desperate performance underneath the physical transformation.
Basically a knock-off of Fight Club
Christian Bale is gaunt, and that's really all the film is known for. Not his best performance or film. The rest is honestly largely forgettable.
Rewatched this movie while I was at work actually lol, I found myself thinking about Christian Bale movies (as one does) and decided to rewatch this nightmare film on my phone while I was packaging orders. If you haven't seen this movie before, I don't recommend multitasking while watching this for the first time because this movie needs you to watch every little thing for it to really make sense in the end and for you to really enjoy it. It is also a definite downer film, so be ready for that. But it really is a great film, very scary and intense and somehow bale still looks like a SNACK even in his sickly state don't @ me
I need to look up/ watch interviews on how Christian Bale got to that body weight, because that was insane. One of the most versatile actors when it comes to changing body mass for roles. A good, not great film that I definitely recommend checking out if you love mystery thrillers.
The story was good but it took waaay to long to get to anything worth really paying attention to.
Synopsis: Christian Bale stars in the mystery thriller, The Machinist. Bale is Trevor Reznick and the film opens with him trying to dispose a dead body into a river. An undisclosed amount of time later, he is back at work. He gets along with his co-workers but keeps to himself and does not socialize. He also spends each evening getting coffee and pie with a waitress Maria that he likes at the airport. Due to his insomnia this is always around 1:30 in the morning. Things continue this way, but Trevor is suffering from insomnia and says to a prostitute Stevie (Jennifer Jason Leigh), that he visits frequently, that he has not slept in a year. One day at work, he gets distracted by a mysterious co-worker Ivan he met, and as a result the man he was supposed to be supervising gets into a horrific accident and loses his arm. This begins a downward spiral for him as his co-workers begin to dislike him and his neurotic behavior. Mysterious notes begin showing up on his fridge, he forgets to pay his bills and he starts to think there is a conspiracy against him. Either it is his current co-workers, Miller who lost his arm, or maybe even the Maria he frequently visits at the airport. Perhaps it is even the mysterious Ivan who only shows up here and there to tantalize him. When he can’t even trust Stevie and he is told there is no Maria at the airport he always frequent, he starts to think everyone is out to get him. Trevor must figure out who is out to get him, so he can keep his sanity or what little of it he has left. Review: The Machinist is a solid unraveling mystery. The tension just slowly increases throughout the film. Because Reznick is a loving and caring person overall, you feel for him and want him to get better and get over his insomnia. Christian Bale’s weight lose for the film is quite astonishing and turns him into a character that appears more frail, lonely and endearing. With Jennifer Jason Leigh as the prostitute you have another layer of desolation and sadness. All the characters are down to Earth and relatable, so that’s what makes the story resonate more. When the mystery itself is revealed, part of it seems lackluster given all the events that happen in the film. Despite this, you still feel a sense of redemption and satisfaction for Trevor as now he can finally rest. Some of timeline of all the events are confusing and they ask the audience to put it together as well as some of the relationships with the characters. It really makes you decide what is real and what isn’t, or when or when he was not hallucinating. Bale’s acting is great and his dedication to this film is astonishing. He apparently ate only tuna and an apple a day, and even took up smoking to curb his appetite. Except for Reznick, nobody else gets much closure or anything else. Despite this The Machinist is a solid and well directed mystery. The music, pacing and misdirection throughout the film keeps what could have been a very boring movie into more of an engaging one. 4 Stars -11.29.2018
this movie is the definition of “mind-fuck” and i loved almost every minute of it. the ending was kind of half-assed though :(
2nd time watching this movie and I’m giving it half a star lower. I think I enjoyed it more the first time, but this time round I’m much surer on why it is a phenomenal film. Does that make sense? It’s gross to look at, and the whole film had me feeling weird. The shots of Bale and his anorexia are hard to watch, and even passing scenes such as Bale eating wings had me feeling uneasy. You know it’s setting up for a weird twist, but you don’t know what’s coming, and the 2nd time round I’m just as impressed. I was really excited by the use of light and darkness. There is one particular scene where Bale walks to use his cigarette lighter and he walks from an area where the sky above is light and clear into a dark, gloomy and stormy area. This is just as we are introduced to an integral aspect of his demise. There is plenty more of this, but you’ll have to find it yourself. I believe my 4.5 was initially overstated, but this is a great movie.
Bale's performance is brilliant and really elevates a mediocre movie about mental deterioration to a good-ish one. Really would have prefered if the film handled the subject of "which events are even really happening?" a little more subtly instead of shoving it in your face so heavily. Overall felt like a poor man's version of Memento, but still worth a watch, be it only for Bale's acting.
Not great. This movie is nothing more than the Christian Bale gets skinny film.
Honestly its crazy how thin Christian Bale got for this role. He was excellent in this film and should have atleast been nominated for an oscar for his performance. 7.4/10
I don't know which is more impressive, Christian Bale's performance, or his dedication. He drops 63 pounds for this role, to the point that he can barely run.   “A little guilt goes a long way.” — Trevor  Probably the most important line in the entire film, and you don’t even know it yet…
Come for skinny Christian Bale, stay for interesting-but-not-amazing psychological intrigue.
Left or right way?
The portrayal of mental deterioration in this film is some of the best. Anyone who knows me knows that I’m a huge fan of psychological thriller/horror films. And this one delivered in every regard. Christian Bale’s performance in this is my favorite of his that I’ve seen. It is so haunting and he disappears into his role. I love films like this that play with your mind as well as the characters because then when things start to unravel it’s all the more interesting. One of the very best in this genre in my opinion. Definitely a must watch if you’re into the sort of Alfred Hitchcock type vibe. Reminded me a lot of Psycho when I was watching it.
“If you were any thinner, you wouldn’t exist.”  Christian Bale is cool, even when he prepares for a role with a wierd daily diet of an apple, a canned tuna, coffee, and cigarettes. His breath must’ve been pretty bad, honestly.  Oh, and the movie is good. I think some of the dialogue is bad, and some performances are clunky, but, dear God, does Bale give a great performance. And the story is memorable! That’s good.
Christian Bale dropped sixty pounds to play a drill-press operator plagued by insomnia. Director Brad Anderson brings the suspense but its Bale's gripping, palpably discomfiting tour de force that holds you in thrall. Its mesmerizing.
'The Machinist' is a dull and anti-climatic film that is only held up by a strong and committed performance by Christian Bale. I had not heard much about this film prior watching it, and my only knowledge on it was that Bale had lost a significant amount of weight for this role. The opening scene promises a dark and compelling (murder?) mystery, but as soon as this scene is over, the remainder of the film drags on. It became clear from the beginning that the character is insane, and therefore not everything is reality. By revealing this so early into the film, the plot-twist at the end isn't anything special. There's no 'ah-ha' moment where you sit there, surprised, shocked and entertained once the movie makes all sense. It's rather an 'oh, okay' moment. While I think the plot wasn't too bad in itself, it was simply the whole way this film was directed. Overly long scenes combined with a very bleak color palette can easily diminish ones attention. However, this film does have a few silver linings. Christian Bale does a fantastic job in this role, fully embodying the character - even from a physical level. The complexity and insanity of the character is highly believable and I'm surprised this did not get an Academy Award nomination! The supporting cast also do a fine job in their roles but were all evidently undermined by Bale. Another perk of the film was the eerie and surreal soundtrack by Roque Baños, who contributed the most to the bizarre and psychotic atmosphere that lingers over this film. Overall, this film was a disappointment for me as it dragged on and led to nowhere. However, it's always a pleasure watching brilliant acting play out on the screen, as well as hearing a masterful soundtrack.
Watched for Cinema 107. Good movie with lots of subtle symbolism and lots of obnoxious symbolism. Also how much can you borrow from Fight Club without being a total ripoff? Honestly my biggest gripe is the score. The orchestral score really sticks out like a sore thumb. A Trent Reznor score or something like the score from Under The Skin would have complimented the gritty, high contrast visuals much more. Instead it’s this bland conventional score trying to sound like the next Hitchcock soundtrack. Go full grit, make it really fucking nasty. Not this half ass grit.  Honestly with a better score and a trim of some really stupid dialogue and obnoxious imagery I would probably love this movie.
Why Christian Bale can't sleep at night?? Because he's a BATMAN!!!
Bale is fantastic in this Alfred Hitchcock clone of a film.
No more Christian Bale before bed.
It seems Patrick Bateman may have taken the “you can always be thinner” thing a bit too far. Movie Game
SPOILERS FOLLOW   We can see the twist of this coming a mile away, yet a couple things hold our attention about this film. 1.) Christian Bale's 110% committed performance, dedicated to giving it his all. What we get for it isn't, for a psychological thriller, a deeply unsympathetic character. Instead, he's a surprisingly decent character who finds himself at odds with what he's becoming and a reflection of what he sees himself as. What we see him as versus what sees himself as makes it challenging and a bit more engaging than other films where it would be easy to make the same movie, but without the same connection to the main character. 2.) The dark tone is unyielding, like the David Fincher movie Se7en but ultimately that has it's rewards because much of it, going back to Bale, comes from his own perception. That leads to three, the clues. Easy to piece together but the filmmakers want to encourage us to think and decipher what they mean. When you fully realize the movie is from Trevor's eyes, which are deceptive and misleading to even him. By the end, if our connection to Trevor is held through the rest of the movie, we'll see him not differently but in a deeper light. Deeper, more understanding and perhaps even more sympathetic than before. The truth that Trevor sees himself as a monster, a child killer will help him find peace with what kind of man he is. Not a monster, but a deeply traumatized individual who needs to accept that his denial is the only thing that's stopping him from moving forward. His guilt manifests everywhere in his life; his acceptance helps him move forward. When I think about Shutter Island, I think about the clues not leading anywhere despite being an interesting concept. When I think about this, I think about the clues not being hard to figure out but they come second to a disturbing and fascinating character study that has a hopeful conclusion for it's flawed but redeemable main character.
Only as good as it is because of Bale’s astonishing commitment to the role, but the rest of this (especially the twist) didn’t do much for me. The score was hilariously bad in places and detracted from the seriousness of what was unfolding.
Bale's memorable performance till date 😎 Wicked 👍🏻
Bale goes all put and delivers a great performance in this gritty tale of regret and physical and existential emptiness.
I'm a big fan of The Machinist and the way everything is executed is just amazing, especially for someone who is watching it for the first time. I find this film difficult to really think or write or talk about without spoilers. It's one of those films that you just don't want to discuss. You just have to tell everyone that they have to see it. Myself, I've introduced many people to The Machinist, and get a lot of joy watching their reactions as the story unfolds. So, if you have not seen The Machinist, definitely check it out.
Epic film with a satisfying twist and bittersweet ending (mainly bitter).
The Silent Hill 2 of movies.
I guessed right mostly because I’ve seen Fight Club.
this is really just fight club’s lame cousin. people are saying that this is a modern day hitchcockian film but that is honestly such an insult this film is hardly original and recycles a lot of the “split-personality twists” that ever so often hit its mark. if my head wasn’t so far up christian bale’s ass i probably would’ve reviewed this film lower.  and so what if i’ve never seen a hitchcock film before Lmao. shudder just released a bunch of  them so this baby boy having himself a snack this halloween. then maybe my review of this may change by probably not.
Impressive body transformation and performance by Bale. Sadly, that is the only impressive part to this movie.
A disturbing look in to insomnia and paranoia. Christian Bale is as always amazing. He completely transformed in to this role. For an actor that usually oozes charisma, that is all gone here. Most movies of this nature give the watcher the question of "is this real or is he crazy?" This movie made clear from the get go that Trevor is crazy and suffering from severe insomnia and that makes it all the more tragic. There were moments throughout of pure tension that kept my eyes glued to the screen. I was worried that such an interesting build up wouldn't have a satisfying conclusion but rest assured, The Machinist will leave you satisfied, disturbed, and after watching the effects of sever insomnia, ready to go to sleep.
The dreamy unnerving score, the Hitchcock feels and the skinniest man alive. Still good fourteen years later.
The Machinst evokes a dream-like feeling in the film, which, of course, goes with the subject matter; almost every facet of the film builds a sense of paranoia, topped off by Christian Bale's startling performance. While the ending doesn't fully feel built towards in a way that feels immensely satisfying, it is still a cyclical payoff that should entertain well-enough. The Machinst is a prime example of a film that takes a concept and allows it to permeate every part of its finer and for better or worse, it'll leave you feeling uneasy, and rarely every sleepy.
Yes this movie was a slow starter and yes at points it was very hard to watch, but Christian Bale was so good that he made you connect with his character on a level that made it impossible to look away. You got right into the head of a person suffering from insomnia and because of the way the movie was made, you able to see it from his point of view. While I wouldn't say that this was an extremely entertaining or fun movie, it was definitely something that drew me in and kept me trying to figure out what exactly was going on.  Entertainment level - 7/10 Acting - 10/10 Writing - 8/10 Story - 8/10
It's hard to separate the facts of the making of the film from the film. If you go so far as to actually damage your body for a role, it is really worth it? So many crazy actors have done that, including Robert Redford. Is it really acting? Fassbender lost a lot of weight, but they also used makeup and he did it under medical supervision. As Laurence Olivier said to Dustin Hoffman, 'Try acting dear boy'.
like a modern day Hitchcock film and I'm a fan
christian bale’s doctor must fucking hate him lmaooo all these drastic body transformations....
i love nightmarish movies, i love movies that are able to convey a mood. its great
Macbre, gloomy, egregious, an encomium of depravity and a fascinating ballad of misconception. This movie has to be the best Christian Bale performance. Ofc all of us know about the typo in the screenplay which made him as thin as an anorexic patient through extremely intellectual web portals like BuzzFeed or Huffpost (erudite portals redefining pedagogy, I must say.) Coming back to the movie, it's greyish teal tint colour pallet added to the gloom. If the phallus stroking of movies like Fight Club would stop, people would notice that there are other worthy movies, better executed than Fight Club, in the same genre.
Christian Bale is great. He looks completely emaciated in this movie. Truly bizarre. Jennifer Jason Leigh is so fantastic too, easily one of my favorite actresses, love her so much. She did such a great job with this role, I always found the scenes with her in contrast to Bale powerful. I got chills during the scene with the fishing photo. She's such a real actress. Anyways, the movie was slightly disturbing, but in a really subtle way. I mean, the gore was out there, but just the subconscious references throughout. They seemed pretty obvious, but I'm not the most intelligent movie-watcher, so sometimes it's nice when things don't slip past me. When they're really out there, it helps me create a deeper interpretation of the movie. All in all, it's dark-toned, twisted, and at times feels incoherent. I'm not sure what Insomnia feels like, but I'm okay with riding along with the delusions.
Usually I don't have a thing for color grading as heavy as used in The Machinist, but here it really works out and helps put us into the dreamlike mind of the insomniac. Oozing with style reminding me somewhat of Drive with it's mostly night settings and shots through windows and other reflective material. Things start falling apart rather quick in the story and we question everything on screen. I was guessing until the very end what was really happening, never getting time to breathe through and feeling thrilled up to the last minute. Bale, which I would have told you right before this movie I didn't ever care for, does a great job as the endlessly tired walking skeleton. I could praise him for his body transformation for this movie, but I guess everyone else already did that, I just liked his flat acting style, it seemed believable to me he didn't really sleep for a year and had a barely working memory. For me specially his workplace almost hit too close to home, having had my apprenticeship in a workshop similar to the one depicted. I always had in mind how dangerous the machinery can be and they always make sure to tell you. Seeing accidents that are so likely to happen in real life on screen is a thousand times more scary to me than the usual horror film slasher villain. The movie Raw with one scene in a similar vain managed to make me quit watching before I fainted on my chair. All in all this was really surprising and it will probably settle into higher tiers of rankings for me.
One of the greatest performances ever committed to film. Deeply unsettling and haunting. So underrated.
Everything about this movie gives you a bad feeling. I live for that bad feeling.
(Old impressions, not based on a recent viewing) I remember it having an amazingly creepy atmosphere, but the story was less than impressive.
Kept waiting for a plot twist that was entirely underwhelming. Respect Christian Bale's commitment to this role. Looked like a junkie - so skinny you could see all of his bones and it was grotesque.
Christian Bale steals the show here and his character is very intresting. without him and the intresting cinematogrophy, this film would have suffered.
Christian Bale hasn't slept in a year and is looking extremely gaunt and drawn out. What is causing this odd behavior? What is real and in his head? Nothing is given away until the last 15 minutes where there is a story dump. Bale is incredible as he physically transformed his body into a mess. Slow mosving and not very exciting. Jennifer Jason Leigh anfd Michael Ironside have breif roles.
An absolutely fantastic and deeply gripping psychological thriller in the vein of Fight Club. The movie instills a certain uneasiness throughout, and the story is making you constantly look for clues to solve the unfolding mystery. The conclusion is in my opinion quite satisfying as well. The only minor gripe I have is that the movie is perhaps not entirely original in concept. For what it is, it's very well executed though.
Christian Bale losing all his weight? Christian Hay
A solid piece of Hitchcock worship, especially thanks to Roque Baños' lovely score (that in itself is obviously more Bernard Herman worship, that usage of strings and theremin is splendid), with THAT Christian Bale performance, that thrives on its otherworldly atmosphere but doesn't mold its parts to become something greater.
60/100 From the opening sequence – Reznik (Bale) trying to get rid of a corpse wrapped in a carpet by throwing it in the sea – it’s clear we’re in for some bleak expressionism. Brad Anderson channels Lynch, Polanski, and especially the Christopher Nolan of “Memento” while the film features mirrors, dismemberment, machinery, dead mothers, doubles, Dostoyevsky, power cuts, ghost trains, sewers and a whole load of bleach. Its all a bit too much (Kosar, who wrote the script is also a main culprit), but the emaciated, insomniac protagonist, who tries to fathom how he got to such a bleary, bruised and scarred state of being (and mind) is brilliantly played by Bale. Actually “played” is far too insufficient a verb to express the lengths that he has gone to for the film (he looks so emaciated that you cant help worrying that its terminal). Its all a bit preposterous yet still effective enough and the ending serves to enable the film to make psychological sense which reverberates back through it, adding some much needed (emotional) gravitas, as well as half a star to the grading.
all yall googled how much weight christian bale lost for this movie right.. a can of tuna and 1 apple a day guys
This is the ideal male body. You may not like it, but this is what peak performance looks like.
Keeping it short and sweet on this one. A well paced and tense psychological thriller that's made even better by a stellar performance from Christian Bale, an unsettling score, and great use of recurring visual motifs.
The Machinist was a film that when I first saw, I thought was perfect. Sadly after rewatching it twice, the film is not as good as I remember. Throughout a majority of the film, it's pretty great but near the end the story kind of falls apart. The subtlety becomes a little too in-your-face and boy oh boy do Leigh's and Bale's performances get real bad. It saddens me to not think of this film as highly as I used to, but its stellar beginning and interesting concept make up for a very lacking end.
One of Christian Bales best performances, and ironically I watched it the same day I watched Insomnia. A very mesmerizing film that puts you into the mind of a man that can't separate reality from imagination. You feel you understand what is going on until, NOPE. I was wrong.
A little guilt goes a long way.   Bale is one of the best actors of this generation, and this is some of his best work, this movie for me pushed what acting can be. What you see on screen is revolutionary, but there is no hint of acting, Bale is the character, he had transformed himself physically and emotionally.   Bale could cruise through life taking lightweight acting jobs earning millions of dollars, instead he takes on a fairly low budget movie by a good, but not oscar-likely director. The guy lives and breathes his career for the sole purpose of passion, this shows especially in this role.  The movie is probably not going to be for everyone, very dark and extremely intense. The claustrophobic tension of Bales character is felt when viewing, you find yourself clutching at any figment of reality you can make out. Perfect directing throughout the entire movie, Anderson exceeds all expectation with strong storytelling.  The cinematography matches the dark tone of the films story, lots of green tones almost representative of Trevor’s decaying reality. The entire film is totally unsaturated not a shred of positive colour to be seen, adding to the unsettling nature of the film.  If you ask me the sole purpose of a movie is to evoke emotion, not necessarily happiness, sadness or fear, just a feeling of some kind. After finishing this film I knew i felt something but i couldn’t articulate to myself what it was that I felt, but I suppose put simply I felt both enlightened and disturbed, the movie won’t leave my mind for a long time and with good reason. A must-see for anybody who considers themselves a film fan, I can’t stop wondering if this is one of the best acted movies start to finish that I have ever seen.
Thoroughly entertaining! FFO: Frank Kafka, David Lynch, dramas from the silver age, and Christian Bale skeletons.
Christian Bale could perfectly play Meryl Streep.
I know who you are. I know who you are. I know who you are.
I was really excited for the end of the movie because I expected a plot twist! I can't believe that the reason which was CLEAR FROM THE BEGINNING was the one to be true. If it wasn't for the "excitement for plottwist" this movie was extremely boring. The atmosphere was okay, tho.
Bale was incredible in this, but it felt like a mashup 3-4 different films, each of which handled the material better. The ending also left a bit to be desired and I figured out certain aspects of it by the end of the first act.
Christian Bale is captivating even if I feel like this film put in too many unresolved mysteries that remain unsolved and unexplained after the final twist. Reminded me a bit of Marc Forster’s film ‘Stay’ in regards to its concept.
I think the Machinist might be my favourite movie so far
I've been wanting to rewatch this film for eons. I'm almost certain I've only seen it once, back in 2004 when it first came out and I remember being blown away by it at the time. While I still think it's a pretty solid film, I'm not sure it blew me away as much as it did 18 year old Tarryn. What does still hold up is Bale, his performance and his dedication. That man is an absolute maniac the way he puts his body through such huge transformations time and time again. Forgot JJL was in it too, was a nice treat to see her there. I feel like she doesn't get enough love. Overall, I think the Machinist is still engaging, shot well and is an interesting enough film, but when you know what's coming, it takes away a lot of the magic.
Christian Bale’s performance might be the best I’ve ever seen. All around great movie.
The Machinist is entangled in paranoia, delusions and a disturbingly thin Bale. Everyone has heard of it. Hosting what is possible the most method performance of all time. But, unfortunately, not many have actually sat down and watched this dark psychological thriller. Which ultimately is a shame as it's a rather engrossing production albeit utilising a robust manufactured narrative that resembles a machine. An insomniac machinist is dismissed after a workplace accident, where his psychological issues result in a downward spiral of paranoia. Methodically constructed and meticulously presented, Anderson's cold clinical direction makes for an enthralling experience with plenty of disturbing imagery. The plot highlights the importance of sleep, a necessary function in regulating our bodies. Becoming an insomniac and refusing professional advice, well it may just decrease both an individual's sanity and efficiency. These are clearly indicated in Bale's performance, one of the most notorious and discussed character portrayals of all time. Committed may just be an understatement. He indicated just how far one can go for their dedicated art. An illuminating performance, hypnotically entrancing in every scene. Whether he be flaunting his scarily thin body or staring at the camera with his overly fatigued eyes, the method changes are only aesthetic details. It is primarily his acting that truly transfixes us and carries Kosar's conscientious screenplay. The blue and grey colour palette of the cinematography enhanced the unwelcoming world that we see through Reznik's perspective. However, as meticulous as the plot was, various details were executed far too obviously that made the twisted conclusion underwhelming. Specific plot points such as the post-it note and the unfamiliar co-worker felt too reminiscent of another famous thriller from 1999. Baños' musical score definitely heightened the lunacy of Reznik's mind, but ultimately fell flat and did not suit the environment that Anderson crafted. Fortunately Bale's career-best performance elevates this thriller to psychological heaven.
Reminiscent of Memento, but still a unique movie, nonetheless. No one could have played the lead better than Bale did.
Damn that's depressing
it’s like fight club, a beautiful mind, safe haven etc. where you think characters are real, but they ain’t. I just don’t like this movie trope personally, I know other people get a kick out of it, but I’m like zzzzzz I liked the music in this and the editing. The extremely desaturated colors are not needed as the story is dismal enough. I liked how it paid homage to Hitchcock in a lot of ways. Christian Bale is fantastic as always, but I just wanted him to take a nap and eat a burger plz
Christian fucking Bale
What stands out most here is Bale's acting and transformation for the role of Trevor Reznik. Storywise, it's nothing very impressive. The script makes a good job on showing the effects of extreme insomnia in Trevor's life but the mix-up between what's real and what's not could be better worked.
i just want christian bale to fucking eat
Not Fight Club directed by not David Lynch with a sprinkle of not Max Payne 2, and a short performance by not Michael Keaton. And it's not good. It's meh. You have to be stupid to not realize the post it not doesn't say killer. Frankly, I was hoping it would say Kilmer, revealing Trevor as the Van Kilmer fan he is.
Oh, to be 20 years old again and think that this was the coolest shit ever.
i suffered & he suffered to lose weight he deserves respect i guess
A stunning performance carries a captivating and thrilling plot with surprising depth
It was so painful watching this guy just existing so when he came at the end looking so healthy and shot I cried.
