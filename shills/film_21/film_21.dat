It was good but can y’all calm down
It feels unnecessary to repeat how incredible a director Stanley Kubrick was and how genuinely impeccable his films turned out to be, and 'A Clockwork Orange' reaffirms this notion. While this is definitely one of his darker films, with plenty of 'ultra-violence' and sex throughout the entirety of the film, it nevertheless lives up to the perfect standard of filmmaking that Kubrick has gained a reputation for. Set in a near dystopian future where violent criminals run amok throughout the streets, the film follows central anti-hero Alex, the leader of a group of droogs, as he goes about causing mayhem within the city, until he is captured after accidentally killing a woman and sentenced to 14 years of prison life. He soon discovers however that there is one way to shorten this sentence and that is by submitting himself to a horrific experimental cure that intends to psychologically reconfigure him. It is a dark, disturbing film which offers an interesting perspective on morality - when Alex suffers as a result of his past crimes, it makes the viewer contemplate whether this is justice for his actions. Kubrick's artistic style shines brightly in this film, with heavy uses of different camera angles (low angle shots are often used in this film to portray a contorted view of reality and has frightening, visceral affects), unique editing, etc. In addition to this, Kubrick utilises a plethora of classical music to accompany the film, reflecting Alex's love for the genre, but simultaneously its adds to the dramatic tension and suspense within the film, and often punctuates the action within a scene. 'A Clockwork Orange' continues the trend of superb Kubrick movies in every way. It is another indisputable masterpiece by the director, and has a brilliant lead performance by Malcolm McDowell (although, outside of his performance, all other actors seem to be overshadowed by him).
so end doesn’t justify the means and machiavelli was wrong
I would be completely okay if society decided to forget this film. Why Kubrick felt the need to make his Free Will film about a deeply viscous person rather than a virtuous person is curious, but not baffling. But why he chose to make vice look so much *fun* is truly beyond me. There is a long list of copycat crimes linked to this film, and not just from the year of its release. Why, when something is causing such clear harm in our world, do we still insist on honoring it? Films like A Man for All Seasons, about a virtuous person refusing to bend to the will of evil authorities should be held up as examples instead. Some may argue that the artistic value of the film should be appreciated, but that is exactly why it is so dangerous. You can find films even more repulsive than this when it comes to acts of sexual violence, but none of them have had Kubrick behind the camera directing it to perfection.
Beautiful film. But what did Stanley Kubrick have against women with larger-than-a-dime areolas/nipples? In all his films they have tiny, tiny nipples. I know he’s got an eye for detail and symmetry but damn.  (I have normal sized nipples I promise)
I think the general idea here — as to whether or not this sort of ‘rehabilitation’ of a criminal is just — is inherently fascinating, but I genuinely don’t think it came across here. It’s well acted to be sure, and you can see the kinds of stylistic flourishes and striking cinematography Kubrick became known for, but the plight of the protagonist was really not that interesting. The pacing is stilted, too, and that really grinds the protagonists journey to an almost standstill. I understand what people see in this movie, and I don’t regret having watched it, but I don’t see it myself.
========================================== Part of My Autumn Rewatches 2.0 Challenge ========================================== Task #6: Rewatch a film by one of your favorite directors. For this task, I decided to revisit my second favorite film by Stanley Kubrick, having already rewatched "2001: A Space Odyssey" (1968) for a different task. I first saw this film in the theater after reading the Anthony Burgess novel upon which it was based, a book I dearly loved and which made me think quite differently about language and its evolution. The film version blew me away, because it not only brought the book to the screen, but also added dimensions either I missed or were invented to extend the story beyond the pages. In any event, the film holds a place on my 50 Favorites list, and it is high time I gave it another viewing. Things I never forgot:  The Korova Milk Bar. Alex (Malcolm McDowell), narrating, and his three droogs: Pete (Michael Tarn), Georgie (James Marcus) and Dim (Warren Clarke). The tables looking like naked women. The milk laced with various drugs. "A bit of the old ultra-violence," taking the piss out of an old drunk. Billyboy (Richard Connaught) and his four droogs about to rape a girl (Cheryl Grunwald). The gang fight. Police sirens. Escape to the country. The ultra-violent home invasion. "Singing in the Rain." The rape of Mrs. Alexander (Adrienne Corri) and crippling of her husband Frank (Patrick Magee). Alex's love of "the old Ludwig Van." Alex skipping school. The penis-shaped ice pops licked by the girls at the mall. The high-speed threesome back at Alex's room. Georgie's plan for a "big crast," robbing Miss Weathers (Miriam Karlin), the wealthy owner of Woodmere Health Farm. Alex teaching Georgie and Dim who the leader is. The attempted robbery and attack on Weathers. The droogies teaching Alex who the boss is. Alex in custody. Weathers dies. Deltoid unable to help. Alex sentenced to 14 years for murder. Prison enrollment. The preaching of the prison chaplain (Godfrey Quigley). Alex volunteering for the "special treatment" -- the Ludovico Technique -- to get released early. The film's core message: "When a man cannot choose, he ceases to be a man." Alex's acceptance into the treatment by government Minister Frederick (Anthony Sharp)(). The explicit videos with music. The sickness. The "proof" of Alex's reformation. Joe (Clive Francis) the lodger renting Alex's room forcing Alex off on his own. Alex attacked by the homeless. Dim and Georgie as policemen. Their beating him. His coming to the home they invaded. Wheelchair-bound Frank and his body guard Julien (David Prowse) trying to help, before realizing who he is. Torturing Alex with Beethoven's 9th. Attempted suicide. Alex in hospital. Headline news. Apology from Minister Frederick. Alex back to "normal."  Things I had forgotten:  Beethoven's 9th sung in the milk bar. Yarbles! The defaced mural in the lobby of Alex's apartment building. His pet snake Basil. His factory-working mum (Sheila Raynor) and weak-willed father (Philip Stone). The home visit from Mr. Deltoid (Aubrey Morris). WOW! = The videodisc for "2001" front and center at the audio/video shop in the mall. Alex's very personal interpretation of the Bible.  There has been no degradation of this film in almost half a century. It's still as powerful today as it ever was. And McDowell totally owned this role, for which he received a Golden Globe nomination for Best Actor in a Motion Picture - Drama. At the Academy Awards, four nominations were received: Best Film Editing (Bill Butler) and well as three Oscar mentions for Kubrick -- Best Picture, Director and Adapted Screenplay. It is and will ever be a masterpiece of 20th century cinema.

This movie made me uncomfy. Stanley Kubrick’s other vision of the future paints a society tearing at the seams, giving the vibe of what the sixties thought the nineties would be like. This slightly off setting of the story really makes you suspend disbelief and just look at what the director is presenting you. And it’s pretty fucking weird. This is just my first viewing so I don’t really get it, but it seems to me that the theme is that no good comes from changing someone’s nature, or trying to. Throughout this movie I just felt sorry for people. I felt sorry for Alex’s victims and wanted him to get what was coming to him. And when he was released I just felt sorry for him, because I believe that he could have lived a well-adjusted life if he didn’t have to reap what he sowed before being admitted. Is the ending a happy one? Certainly for Alex, who is free to life, liberty, and the pursuit of ultra-violence, but the ending presents us with a moral question. If the treatment was the only thing holding him back from his tendencies, does he deserve to be treated as an upstanding member of society, or were the people who treated him badly justified in doing so? Idk man, it’s tough and makes you think. Whole lotta moral questions regarding Alex and the people who interact with him. 8/10
Amazing film. What I liked best is the script, it never lags, from start to finish
This movie was banned in the UK for about 30 years, and watching it now you wouldn't understand why. Back in 1971 I can understand it. The eye bit will always freak me out and the inny outy inny outy will always make me chuckle - yes I'm a bit of a child.
The last time I saw A Clockwork Orange was probably some time in the early 00s, and I remember at the time thinking it was an extraordinarily compelling film that wrestles with the idea of freedom and what to do with sociopaths in our society. On a second viewing, I still think that it's a great movie, but I have far more reservations about it than I did when I was younger. I think I better understand at this point the critiques about violence against women and the glamorization of it, and I do think the story is a bit too simple when grappling with a fairly noncomplex character in Alex. But the camera work is still sharp, and that opening scene still haunts me. I think having watched Singin' in the Rain only a couple of months ago I was very much struck this time around by how much of a juxtaposition it is to put that song in this movie. Overall, I have complicated feelings about this movie. But I do still think it's a masterpiece.
one of the worst movies i’ve ever seen. i’m all about freedom of creativity and stuff, but it was too far. i’m not blaming anyone for that, just the graphic violence and hate scenes were just not my cup of tea. in summary, the movie as a whole was not my cup of tea. don’t watch on a full stomach.
Stanley Kubrick’s A Clockwork Orange, the film uses symmetrical pleasing shots of a modern bizarre world in order to capture the dark sinister acts Alex and his gang pull. Messing up the symmetry we see regular pleasing shots but when the gang pulls an act we get uncomfortable closeups off center shots. During the film we see Alex lacking any empathy for anything, he only desires the thrill of being bad and careless. Ruining homes, violating, raping, and killing the cinematography captures his desire to go against society’s rules as much as possible
uhh this was ... so ... bad ?? i thought this would be incredible but it sorta feels like everyone just likes this & rates it high because it makes them look intellectual or artsy. like this films really not that deep, it's just a really big boring mess. the acting & accents were incredibly annoying that i had to turn it off with 15 minutes left
So I've always had some mixed feelings about this compared to most and I hate to piss people off again, but I'm not feeling this one in the end. On one hand, it's extremely stylish with some of most jaw-dropping erotic production design I've never seen before or even since. The story considering Kubrick's track record on films has a unique commentary that notably criticizes the decline of the standard family unit as the world would head into what would be a very tumultuous decade that spun the ideas of the 60's out of control. That all being said, a lot of its ideas didn't make sense to me (the boy's collection of body parts he has in room) and I honestly felt that its commentary failed to provide any truly realistic insight. Overall, I recognize the brilliance of it, and maybe I need to re-watch it again, but honestly it made me uncomfortable for 2 hours without making me feel like I got something out of it. If anything I would switch it to 4 stars, because I recognize some of the brilliance but I feel much of the extra hype lies more so in how daring it was for the time than its own merits as a film.
yes i watched this again and yes i enjoyed it please don't look at me during this trying time
A clockwork orangutan
"I was cured alright."
“I feel that any second, something terrible is going to happen to me.” - a cured Alex demonstrating a gift for predictions and summing up how I feel most days too.   As it happens, I’m watching this film only a few miles from where it was made.  The rumble between Alex & his Droogs and their rivals is reminiscent of classic ECW action - Spike Dudley or New Jack would have dived off the balcony after slamming their foe through the table.  Patrick Magee is excellent in his role as wheelchair bound avenging husband. His gleeful expression as he tortures Alex by stereo is fantastic.  The nursery school psychiatrist has an awesome tone when addressing Alex - coupled with her bitchin hair colour and dress sense would make exposing your innermost fears and feelings to her much easier. This was her only film role.
The title “A Clockwork Orange” makes me wonder if there’s another Clockwork Orange out there somewhere, because maybe that’s the super amazing great one. Cause this one was just that smirky, arrogant one that ran too long and wasn’t quite as clever as it seemed to think it was.
Had a hard time understanding what some of the actors were saying, not sure if it was the accents or the sound quality of my tv.  I need to watch again with subtitles.  Really enjoyed every other aspect but I don’t think I got as much out of it as I could’ve if I’d known exactly what the actors were saying
Can see why it's a classic it's a well-made film, I just wasn't feeling it, it's worldview or an attachment to the characters.
First Act: Wtf im watching? This guys a monster. Second Act: Atleast the monsters getting punished. Third Act: Damn everyones a monster Its hard to call this a masterpiece cause of how messed up it is but as long as you understand Kubrick was showing it knowing how messed up it all is I think everyone can call this a masterpiece. Again f'd up, and disturbing, but extremely well made and amazing. Which I guess is alot of Kubricks work
This chilling psychological story employs disturbing, violent scenes that explores juvenile delinquency and other such topics in a dystopian near future Britain. The protagonist, Alex, is a charismatic and reckless character who commits horrific crimes, such as rape and murder. One particular scene that captures the disturbing traits of the protagonist is where he and his gang rapes a woman and assaulted her husband as he is forced to watch the act. And although as a spectator I felt uncomfortable, that is reinforced with Alex giggling and singing “Singin’ in the Rain”. The film is a must see, but be ready to feel uncomfortable.
A mutual on twitter replied to one of my tweets but he had a clockwork orange pic on his profile so I didn’t engage. That’s sort of the vibe this film has.
of course men love this movie
Few films are as sensational or infamous as Stanley Kubrick's "A Clockwork Orange". It's impossible to sit through ACO and not have a reaction; whether it be shock, disgust or amazement. The savage tale of a brutal young droog and his subsequent "reformation" by the government is as shocking and thought-provoking as ever. While the film's depictions of violence and sex are what it's most known for, ACO works on far deeper levels. The disturbing portrayal of youth and its satirical depiction of a government's attempts to create a better society are brilliant, but the most fascinating aspect of ACO is the questions it poses about good and evil. While the crimes Alex commits at the beginning of the film are atrocious, what the government does to him is worse. The film presents the absolute worst aspects of man, but shows that even these are still favorable to a man without the choice. People can denounce the film because of its brutal content, but the importance of the questions it poses can't be denied. Equally excellent to the film's content is the effort by the crew. Kubrick's perfectionism pays off well, as ACO in one of his most visually striking films. Malcolm MacDowell is nothing short of amazing as Alex. Kubrick's use of surreal imagery and set pieces, as well as the ingenious use of music to compliment the on-screen action, creates a world that perfectly reflects the protagonist's behavior and the government's policies. A Clockwork Orange is by no means an easy film to get through, as many will be turned off by the scenes of violence and rape. But this masterpiece is far more complex than a simple romp through a world of youthful violence. It's a rare example of film-making that demands that the viewer actually think. Real horrorshow all around, Oh my brothers.
Whatever I once loved about this movie, I've since outgrown it.
Kubrick never fails when it comes to delivery some incredible imagery, sound design, and his overall direction. A Clockwork Orange may feel a little disjointed but ultimately its real horrorshow exploration of morality and violence grabs you whether you want it to or not.
Chilling look into human conditioning and how to treat and fix the crime problem thinking of the criminals mental state. I wouldn’t find it hard to believe if they tried this stuff today and the public would be okay with it Want to watch this one a lot more in the future
As I watched 'A Clockwork Orange' for the first time in several years, I gritted my teeth at the despicable lead character of "ultraviolient" Alex - a murderer, rapist, and psychopath. I thought to myself that this film should be worth 5 stars, if only the respective protagonist weren't such a foul excuse of a human being. But then I remembered the golden rule: Stanley Kubrick doesn't do anything by accident. The greatest films are the ones that can be more closely equated as ~experiences.~ We as the audience find ourselves in a paradoxical discomfort similar to our anti-hero. Alex, who lusts for violence, agrees to undergo an experimental therapy to "cure" him of criminal urges. In a nutshell, that boils down to him having something like a super-panic-attack every time he tries to commit violence. Meanwhile, we as the audience have a natural inclination to seek a redeeming or relatable quality about the person whose story we're following, but find ourselves contrarily disturbed by a pass-time that a lot of people solely categorize as entertainment. Along with endless phallic imagery, Kubrick makes a bold statement by intentionally including all sexual activity to be associated with rape, and thus violence. This coincides with the coincidence (?) of Beethoven's music being included in the background of Alex's therapy, thereby making him sick at the sound of his once-beloved symphonies. I had to take several breaks in the midst of watching this. Don't forget that it's actually healthy for you to be perturbed by some of the things you see.
The closing credits with simple text and one bright colored background.... Yes please.
Definitely horrifying but also an experience that's hard to forget. I'm not sure if that's good or bad.
Commentary
Alex be like: can I borrow a egg
I always have a harder time getting through the last forty minutes of this than the first 80. Darkly comic to the point of savage— as the back 3rd starts to mirrior its first, it starts to feel more like a philosophical exercise than a film that grabbed me by the bollocks — instead of laughing at the jokes, I start thinking, “isnt Mr. Kubrick quite the clever fellow?” and I’m taken out of the world he’s created. Seems to have fallen just a touch in my eyes with subsequent viewings over the years.
wtf is going on  my gulliver is hurting  so why has this so crazy.
A cold, dystopian nightmare. Kubrick has a particular way of visualizing his films as I've noted several times now. 'A Clockwork Orange' truly feels like a dystopia, looking completely out of its time and instead placed somewhere in the future. It is a tough film to categorize... it's a biting social satire with dramatic moments, but also feels like a very darkly humorous comedy with a horrifying rape scene set to "Singin' in the Rain" thrown in for good measure. I would argue the film still comes across as being very modern today, much less in 1971. I come away with new observations and a new perspective every time I take in the film, and because of that the film has surpassed its initial controversial reviews to become the cult classic it is today. It's not Kubrick at his best, but it might be Kubrick at his most entertaining.

Was inspired to revisit this after listening to the most recent episode of the Unspooled podcast, hadn't seen it since my college days (early 2000s), as a teen when I was getting into movies this was one of my first favorite Kubrick films (along with The Shining), I even had a poster on my bedroom wall, it's a fun a movie, especially those first 45 minutes where all the iconic scenes take place (the ultra violence), I always forget that the bulk of the film deals with Alex's rehabilitation, but honestly that is where the true meat to the story lies, this is a masterfully constructed film, its imagery is just as potent as its allegory, the use of music and 70s wallpaper designs is incredible, and the prison scenes with Chief Officer Barnes seem like a dry run for R. Lee Ermey in Full Metal Jacket. "Shut your filthy hole, you scum!" Not one of my favorite Kubrick films anymore, not even in the top 5, but that speaks more to the strength of Kubrick's body of work than anything about the quality of Clockwork itself, ya droogs.
This fantastic 1971 crime film based on the novel by Anthony Burgess follows the young protagonist Alex, who is fascinated by committing violent crimes such as robbery, rape, and assault, as he is arrested and is mentally altered by a brainwashing experiment known as the "Ludocivo's technique" created by the government. This film is definitely not for the faint of heart, as it features many disturbing and somewhat explicit scenes of violence and rape. However, this film is extremely entertaining, and will keep the audience's attention easily. There are many odd and shaky camera angles used throughout the film, and lots of interesting lighting choices. I would reccomend this film to viewers who want a very twisted and disturbing but also intelligent and creative film.
Malcolm McDowell and Jack Nicholson need to be a film together.
I like the exploration of personal agency in this film. Is there ever a circumstance where someone's ability to choose for themself should be taken away from them?
if i hadn’t read the book beforehand, i probably would’ve hated this. but i’m really glad Kubrick decided to stay faithful to this one (sorry Stephen) and the extreme violence and sexual content actually made the themes hit home harder
It's much more but obscure. It shows how the human brain can be manipulated, in a way where it manipulates the audience. Simply telling how the brain is ticking. It's not for everyone, because it's so offensiv and sometimes even disgusting. So maybe I'm one of the "not everyone" and therefore I couldn't enjoy it, that much.
No time for the old in-out love, I’ve just come to read the meter.
Makes sense Dim and George would turn out to be cops.
Where do I start... the complexity of the sets in the movie... from the narration.... to the execution of the nadsat language from the novel.... I absolutely love this movie. No scene in this movie was unnecessary and every scene was beautiful and intricately created.
Imagine showing this movie to Beethoven and asking him what he thought of Kubrick’s use of his ninth symphony.  He’d be all “Warum bewegt sich dieses Gemälde?”
Kubrick truly is one of, if not the greatest of all-time.
Kubrick’s punk rock film. It was the shortest film shoot he’s ever done and it has a rushed, sloppy look to much of it (long, luxurious zooms and dollies notwithstanding).  I never realized how funny it is.  If you take the entire thing completely seriously you are missing the tone of the film.  Yes, it’s artistic and yes, it has something to say about humanity and morality, but it also has dick jokes, slapstick, gratuitous nudity and violence and overacting for comedic purposes.  In my mind I composed a very long dissection of the film and its purpose and the ending and the film’s status in the world of 2018 but I realized  A) it would be too long and boring  B) this film has been analyzed and over-analyzed to death for the past 40 years.   Basically ACO is Anarchy In the UK.  A very British scream about the decline of civilization and warning against creeping totalitarianism with a charismatic young lead who’s also very dangerous but still funny.
I've seen this film multiple times, but I still struggle with it. I can appreciate that it is a great movie, but do I actually like it? I honestly don't know.
Alex, milk, beautiful movement, classical references, clear plot, a must watch movie before you die.
A young chelloveck givin an ol devotchka a bit of the in-out in-out yesss?
surprisingly turned out to be my favorite kubrick film? not sure how that happened
Malcolm Mcdowell once said:  ‘a clockwork orange makes an unpalatable character palatable’  ...but it’s 2018 and we don’t sympathize rapist
Up until now, I've always considered this to be a masterpiece of social commentary and dark humor, but on this rewatch, I was struck by just how dated and ridiculous it is. Kubrick serves up a dystopian future that appears as if Western civilization just stopped during the Mid-century Modern design movement and melded with grey British Milton-Keynes apartment blocks, then he populates this retro-mod-socialist world with a bunch of 2-dimensional stereotypes of hapless authority figures, ineffective parents, and pathetic delinquents wearing false eyelashes and jockstraps on the outside of their long johns. The "ultraviolence" practiced by these aforementioned criminal slackers is almost exclusively targeted towards women, grotesquely played for laughs, and choreographed to cheesy, Moog-y electronica courtesy of Walter (now Wendy) Carlos. I guess this was pretty shocking stuff back in '71, but today, it wouldn't frighten anyone outside of a Mennonite compound. I found Malcolm McDowell's performance particularly annoying. His use of "Nadsat" seemed egregiously false and unnatural, and his constant smirking and mugging didn't convey any sense of danger, but seemed more appropriate to some sort of pantomime. If you plopped Little Alex down in the middle of Chicago or Los Angeles today, some MS-13 gangbanger would probably pop a cap in his ass within 5 minutes. It isn't all a waste though. The questions it poses about free will being necessary to truly choose between good and evil, the inability of prisons to rehabilitate inmates, and how society transforms criminals into authority figures are just as pertinent today as they were back in '71.
Oddly not as impressed with this as I was last time I saw it in my 20s, but also really feeling like I need to watch it again soon.
i feel like this one gets way way way more praise than it deserves because of its director. the least kubrick could've done was present it from an angle that didn't feel sympathetic to these awful awful things that happen. ew. the author of the novel said it best himself: "We all suffer from the popular desire to make the known notorious. The book I am best known for, or only known for, is a novel I am prepared to repudiate: written a quarter of a century ago, a jeu d'esprit knocked off for money in three weeks, it became known as the raw material for a film which seemed to glorify sex and violence. The film made it easy for readers of the book to misunderstand what it was about, and the misunderstanding will pursue me until I die. I should not have written the book because of this danger of misinterpretation..."" anyway it's really really pretty to look at.
Wake up in the mornin' feelin' like Alex DeLarge Grab my droogs, I'm out the door, I'm gonna be in charge Before I leave, brush my teeth with a bottle of milk Cause when I leave for the night I'm gonna cut some silk I'm talking makeup on our eyes, eyes, Beating up other guys, guys Breaking into people's homes, homes, Get arrested, playing our favorite symphonies Getting aversion therapies, Trying to get a little bit tipsyyy... Don't stop, make heads pop Droogs, blow some people up Tonight, I'm-a fight Till we see the sunlight Tick-tock on the clockwork orange But wait, nothings rhyme with orange...ohhhh...ooo oo o oohhh...
Kindly take your "but you didn't get it" and shove it.
I thought I had watched this all the way through before, maybe when I was 16 or 17, but I hadn't. I guess this is fine? Maybe it's lost its shock value over time. Kubrick's weakest film that I've seen so far. Why is this always considered in the best movies of all time? It's in the Letterboxd and IMDb top 250 lists. Why? Just because it's a Kubrick film? Ugh. I have so many questions.
Cured of his sanity.
Honestly, I hate the aesthetic. The dialogue recording style is grating. I get what Kubrick is going for with a lot of this, and there's some admirable themes and iconic imagery, but I'm not sold on the execution. On the whole it was far from my favorite of his work.
I was a little confounded watching this now. Not about the story, but about how much I like it. I've seen it before, probably 20 years ago, much younger and liked it. (I read the book back then too.) And today, I still dig Kubrick, and even more enjoy things with a philosophical bent -- what is moral? -- but then so... why didn't I enjoy this more? I'm not sure. I think perhaps the irony is just pushed to such an extreme, call it ultra-irony, that it loses its touch. It feels like a cartoon, and perhaps just a little subtlety would have brought this back for me.
This movie covers a lot of complex themes and does it really well. The protagonist of the movie is unlike any I have seen before. The films makes the audience ask questions about, good and evil, free will, morals, and what is the price we are willing to pay to live in a "free society".
Alex DeLarge is the anti-hero of Stanley Kubrick’s classic dystopian fantasy, A Clockwork Orange. He is played with charismatic creepiness by Malcolm McDowell. He inhabits a grotesque London of the future, or perhaps an alternate-present. Alex leads his band of droogs (friends) on a series of antisocial and ultra-violent escapades. We look to the particulars of these crimes in an ultimately fruitless attempt to decipher what makes this guy tick. He brutally beats a street vagrant—perhaps he is motivated by contempt, or perhaps by a perverse desire to rid society of its more unpleasant elements. No, he then takes on a rival gang, doing similarly heinous stuff, though it is clear he does not care about saving his rival’s victims. Perhaps he’s seeking power, feeding his pride. When we get to the writer’s home, we witness Alex gleefully ransack a man’s home, beat him to a pulp, and brutally rape his wife all while singing ‘Singin’ in the Rain.’ While he does steal some money, greed hardly explains such repulsive and dehumanizing behavior. We do get some glimpses into Alex’s home life, and there’s certainly some bad parenting that has shaped Alex, but the film more-or-less avoids some kind of Freudian explanation of how his mommy and daddy made him a monster. Alex is a sociopath, plain and simple. Kubrick manages to sustain our interest in Alex by starving us of any alternatives. His companions, his family, his authority figures, and even his victims are either just as bad or impossibly remote. His corrections officer for example is clearly sinister and predatory. His parents are harmless, but are clearly so disconnected from what Alex actually is, that their obliviousness is an enabler. The writer and his wife, the victims of his most brutal act, are stultified caricatures. They don’t seem real. While not particularly evil (in this scene), they are certainly not good, and they are rather bland. While Alex is completely wicked, he is never bland, speaking to the audience articulately, imaginatively, and seemingly earnestly. Alex then has no competition for our interest. This perspective makes the first forty-five minutes of this movie a highly unpleasant experience. Following Alex’s relentless antics is ultimately degrading. By offering such a limited perspective, Kubrick is depriving us of choice. At this point, alarm bells should be going off: deprived of choice? Why, that’s the whole point of the movie! How brilliant this must be! And I suppose this line of thinking works—to an extent. After all, we will shortly find out, as the movie’s dialogue will clearly tell us, that depriving a being of free will is too high a price to pay for fighting crime. You see, Alex will soon be arrested, he’ll be institutionalized, and later will be selected for the “Ludovico technique.” This technique uses drugs and aversion therapy to essentially reprogram Alex, giving him severe illness associated with violent or sexually aggressive acts. The prison’s minister objects to the technique, as stated above, because of free-will concerns. The now-meek Alex is released to society, but things don’t go as planned. His parents have replaced him, and the rest of society is eager to take revenge. Beaten and tortured, Alex attempts suicide. This turns public sympathy his way, and he becomes somewhat of a celebrity. The government reverses the programming in exchange for his help with propaganda. The point is, we are led to believe, that there are important insights, and provocative themes at play here that justify Alex’s anti-heroism. These themes, I am told, are things like the nature of free-will, the importance of individuality versus the need to protect society, nature versus nurture, totalitarianism and institutionalism, to name a few. I don’t buy it. The suffering Alex undergoes in the last act of this movie is not a matter of his lack of free will. Rather, he suffers consequences of his prior acts. His inability to harm the homeless man doesn’t cause violence; the vagrant, in fact, seems willing to let him pass on his way, until he recognizes him as the man who had beaten him. Perhaps the free will does come into play in the fact that Alex lacks the ability to chose to defend himself. But in that case, the commentary is not all that insightful. Here, it’s an imbalance of free will that causes the suffering, ie the vagrant has the capacity to choose to beat Alex, but Alex lacks the choice to defend himself. Of course this is a rotten state of affairs, but more because of the unfairness than anything to do with the state of human nature. There is a strong case to be made that the capacity for free will is essential for human happiness. This is part of the theistic response to the problem of evil; that despite the fact that will often causes suffering, our capacity for free will itself is essential in order to avoid suffering and seek happiness. This movie never deals with any real ideas, all it does is set up sloganeering straw men and knock them down. It thrives on the more extreme manifestations of evil, but never considers virtue; never considers what it means to be good. It just retreats to a sort-of cult-worship of individualism. Ultimately, what we’re left with is rather brutal: the first act is Alex tortures society, the second act is government tortures Alex, and the last act is society tortures Alex, with a coda that suggests the government will team up with Alex to get the last laugh. It suggests some broad themes, but never really delivers. It’s as philosophically deep as a book-jacket summary of Beyond Good and Evil. This pretends to be a film about morality, but never gets past its own attitude. We’re left with an attitude of individualism and an attitude of constraint, but nothing of substance at the center. Early on, I referred to the movie as a classic, and I stand by that, even though I don’t like it much at all. Normally, a classic means something that stands apart among its class, something that has earned special recognition. As much as I object to this movie—and, really, I hate it—I can’t ignore its impact. It clearly resonated with audiences, not just upon its 1971 release, but it has endured. It means something to multiple generations. That doesn’t mean I’m wrong; an enduring reputation doesn’t mean a movie is necessarily good. But I do believe that I should approach this with humility. I don’t like it, I don’t connect with it, but I recognize it means a lot to a lot of people. My goal here is not to convince these people that they’re wrong, but simply to express my point of view.
not what i expected but in an oddly good way. basically about good vs bad and law and order but in the most unique way
So, here’s the thing. The book by Anthony Burgess is one of my favourite if not my favourite piece of literature. Even though I adore Kubrick and will forever praise his directorial genius I will never forgive him for not including the final chapter on the book in the movie. I was so upset by that decision that it very nearly ruined the film for me. However, I do think it is an amazing movie if you manage to separate it from the original source. Which I can’t. But I do recognise the impact it has had and I do think it deserves its place as a classic.
Having read the book before going into this film, i have to say I was not dissapointed. I believe that this was a very well done adaptation of a frankly shocking novel. The acting and visuals were spot on and had the same tone as when I read the book. The performance in this film was practically flawless in my personal opinon. Frankly, i love this film.
I watched this to see if I can predict what type of story "A Clockwork Orange" is. I'm quizzing myself because I want to perfect this ability to categorize stories. I got this idea from the book "The Seven Basic Plots," which suggests every story in human history falls within one such plot. I didn't anticipate this being among the most grotesque and disturbing movies I've seen. And unlike many other grotesque and disturbing movies, in this one the violence seems to exist for its own sake. Characters don't really change, the plot doesn't really move forward, and I guess I failed this quiz and also am a bit haunted before bed now. I wouldn't want to be around Stanley Kubrick on Halloween.
Rewatched for this week's episode of Unspooled. I've often thought about how Kubrick made 2001 as his sci-fi movie, Dr. Strangelove as his satire movie, and the Shining as his horror movie, and they happen to be among the best sci-fi, satire, and horror films ever made, respectively. In that spirit, A Clockwork Orange feels like Kubrick's B movie. It has the feel of an exploitation film, with gratuitous violence and nudity. Although much of the violence and sex is crucial to the story, there are places where nudity is seemingly thrown in just to be there, which really gives it a 60s/70s sexploitation feeling. Secondly, all the performances are quite a bit...extra. From Aubrey Morris's portrayal of probation officer Mr. Deltoid flailing and grabbing Alex's crotch, to Patrick Magee's Mr. Alexander screaming at Alex at the table, to Malcolm McDowell himself in the exaggerated chewing scene that closes the film, it feels like everyone was instructed to be broad. Whether or not this was the intention, it gives the film a cheesy B movie quality in my opinion. And to be sure, it's among the better B movies, but I still struggle with whether that means it's great. I downgraded this a half a star upon this viewing, though I still think there are a lot of interesting filmmaking choices to talk about. Maybe someone in the podcast or on the Unspooled forum will convince me to reassess and give that half star back.
I think I’m settling on the realization that, with few exceptions, Kubrick is not the filmmaker for me. Too didactic, too much thumbing his nose at the audience, too many performances pitched at wildly different levels - from horrible overacting to completely non-emotive.  But what about this film. To start, I don’t know what to make of his specific choice of style. Lots of sex and horrific violent thorough (yes, I think he’s conflating rape with sex...topic for another essay).   But, he’s making a clear choice, particularly in the first half, to make it all look so...cool, for lack of a better word. (Believe me, I’ve tried to think of a better word) Tall shadows. Slow motion fighting set to Beethoven. Perfectly lit and composed shots.  Attractive actors. The rape scene at the beginning is literally set on a lit stage with the motions of the people looking almost like a West Side Story dance fight.  Why the contrast of horific acts with such stylized filmmaking?  What is the intention of this choice?  Clearly there are options on how to depict this if the intent is to make us horrified. If I’m feeling generous, I’d guess that he’s saying something about the casual introduction of sex and violence into art and where the boundaries are or should be.  Not sure if it’s this, or he just can’t resist making things look all stylish and cool.   For my art theory:  I mean, the  murder scene has a duel between a phallic and a statue of Beethoven. And then his cure also leaves him unable to appreciate his favorite art. A bit on the nose, frankly.     But I don’t think he does much with these ideas. It seemed abandoned at the half way point- somewhere after the unnecessarily long scene where the prison guard exchanges receipts with the doctor (thumbs nose at audience). The end half is a distorted morality play where he is visited by all his past victims. And then the government regulates the deranged work of a writer of subversive literature and makes an alliance with Alex to appease the masses. Feels like Kubrick is making one  last salvo at this art commentary, this time pulling government into the mix.   In the end, a bit of a mess. Half baked ideas without really committing to any of them. But I’m sure I just don’t get it ,man, cause Kubrick is a super genius who’s just filming three dimensional chess.
A Clockwork Orange is a landmark dystopian film from acclaimed filmmaker Stanley Kubrick. The film follows Alex de Large as a small gang leader who commits crimes, gets imprisoned, and becomes reformed and rehabibilitated. The film's usage of on screen violence and graffic nudity and sexual acts have garnered substantial controversy. The film, sonically and visually is quite brilliant. Like many Kubrick works, the attention to detail is remarkable. Every set piece, every frame, and every use of dialogue is crafted nicely. The dialogue, is quite unusual. The vocabulary is abnormal and unique, using words foreign to way normal people speak. The wacky work choice is just so strange to modern viewers, it definitely takes time to get used to. The character of Alex is a very iconic one. Malcolm McDowell delivers a great performance which headlines his career. His transformation or the lack there of, goes hand in hand with this film. The film is as nightmarish as it is humoring. The script allows some comic aspects but the cold story grounds it. The film is very striking but still leaves something to be desired. The thematic elements, social and political topics, and disturbing imagery are all explored well in detail. The film just isn't lasting for me. It's an extremely well made film, but it doesn't rank as highly as other Kubrick films.
Where's my Basil?
HORROR x52 Challenge (2018) - #41: Rewatch #01 “It's funny how the colors of the real world only seem really real when you viddy them on the screen” A Clockwork Orange will cause your tick-tocker to race. An absolute sinny horrorshow for the ages. Kubrick understands how to make the viewer feel like a detail in a overwhelming landscape of strack and terror. This is easily one of the most misunderstood cine’s I’ve ever encountered, and to a degree I can viddy why. It’s as if your omny has to be tuned to the correct channel before being able to appreciate this zammechat worldcast. If you haven’t experienced A Clockwork Orange, I suggest you pour yourself a tass of the old moloko and nachinat right away. Listen closely to the warbles and prepare for some ultraviolence.
My entry for 1971 for my series on the defining films of the New Hollywood Movement: Personal Thoughts: It had been over a decade since I last watched A Clockwork Orange, but rewatching it for this project, I found that my feelings on it are more or less the same as they were the first few times I watched it; it's certainly a very unique movie, and one that I have a lot respect for, but not really one I love, unfortunately. To get my negatives out of the way first, I suppose I could mention how it occasionally tries just a bit too hard to be shocking and "edgy" (such as the end credits using the actual original recording of "Singin' In The Rain" after the film radically, let's say, "recontextualized" that particular song earlier), or how on-the-nose some of the film's delivery of its themes are (you could even say it's a bit (gulp) Nolan-y at times in that regard) but those are minor issues when put next to my main complaint about ACO, which is how unnecessarily over the top its general sensibilities are. Part of that may be due to the style of the film feeling occasionally self-indulgent, but Kubrick's direction here, for the most part, is rather effective in its trippy, nightmarish tone, so that aspect of the film definitely helps more than it hurts on the whole; rather, the main problem is with how ridiculous and exaggerated so many of the supporting performances in the film are, especially in the second half. You see, when comparing Clockwork to the rest of Kubrick's body of work, I feel that the various over the top bits of acting in something like Dr. Strangelove actually contributed something positive to that particular film, as they served the movie as a whole, and worked to illustrate the inherent absurdity of "mutual assured destruction" as a policy of national defense. Heck, even the extremely under the top performances in 2001 served to demonstrate the theme that mankind in that film had become jaded and lifeless, even in the wonderous future they inhabit. On the other hand, the needlessly exaggerated histrionics of Clockwork, whether it be the obnoxious simpering of Alex's probation officer, the random, abrupt screaming of the chief prison guard, or the incessant quivering of the writer's barefaced rage (whose actor actually asked Malcolm McDowell if his performance was too over the top) don't serve to do anything but make the film more tedious to watch, makes the characters feel phony and inauthentic, and only removes the film even further from the reality that its attempting to comment on, which, when you consider the already heightened, futuristic dystopia it takes place in, was an entirely unnecessary decision on the part of Kub. Besides that main quibble, however, I have to say that A Clockwork Orange is still fundamentally a pretty good movie on the whole, and one well worth watching for any film fan, as the production design maintains a nice balance between urban decay and sleek, alien futurism, a contrast that we really don't see enough of in sci-fi, the themes, while, again, are occasionally too obvious and self-conscious in their delivery, still pack some potent messages on the nature of free will, whether nature or nuture is the more important factor in determing the kind of people we become, and whether true inner rehabilitation and change is possible for human beings, and the style of the film works wonderfully for the most part, with Wendy Carlos's sinister, disorienting synthesized score striking an appropriately dystopian tone, the sequences of Alex's intense, kaleidoscopic hallucinations get us more intimate than we ever wanted to with the droog's sick, twisted brain, and John Alcott's cinematography is constantly, unusually kinetic in its movement without ever drawing too much attention to itself. My complaints about the overacting aside, A Clockwork Orange is still a unique as hell, one of a kind experience otherwise, and one you won't have to have your eyes pried open to stay awake for, that's for sure. Significance To The Movement/Cinema As A Whole: Despite his directorial career beginning well before the start of the New Hollywood era, Kubrick still showed 2001 was no fluke, and that he was more than keeping pace with the rest of the movement with Clockwork, as, besides the film's aforementioned experimental, surreal overall style, which makes it feel the most "New Hollywood" of any of Kubrick's films from the period, and the fact that it was one of the highest-grossing releases of the year, it was also nominated for four Oscars including Best Director and Best Picture, showing that the Academy of old was actually much less conservative at the time that it has become in recent decades. That fact is even more impressive when you consider just how much nudity, rape, and the ol' "ultra-violence" the film contains, which actually netted it the dreaded "X" rating at the time, and which, in addition to to the film's anti-government, anti-authority bent (which kept it in perfect spirit with much of the rest of the movement) results in yet another transgressive, boundary-pushing New Hollywood film, and arguably the most iconic one of its year, which is saying something, as you'll soon see below... Other significant New Hollywood films from '71: '71 saw a ton of other notable NH releases, including Robert Altman's McCabe And Mrs. Miller, a gorgeous, haunting Revisionist Western (and before you ask, I did bother to watch it before I wrote this, thank you very much), Peter Bogdanovich's coming-of-age tale The Last Picture Show, one of saddest, most emotionally devastating films I've ever seen, and my new personal favorite from the year (and also just one of my favorite films, period), Sam Peckinpah's grisly home invasion thriller Straw Dogs, Hal Ashby's Harold And Maude, a macabre, morbidly funny tale of a particularly odd May-December "romance", and a pair of notable police thrillers in the form of Don Siegel's iconic, influential Dirty Harry, and William Friedkin's Best Picture-winning The French Connection. And all of that's without even mentioning Alan Pakula's proto-erotic thriller Klute, Clint Eastwood's directorial debut Play Misty For Me, George Lucas's cold, dystopian sci-fi THX 1138 (which also his cinematic debut as well), Mike Nichol's Carnal Knowledge, or Jerry Schatzberg's addict drama Panic In Needle Park, which featured the first starring role from some guy named Al Pacino; you may have heard of him.
what. the. actual. fuck?
I feel like I need to rewatch this to truly judge it. Can’t wait to listen/watch some analysis videos of this later today. My initial reaction is wow. I think Kubrick is truly exploring the essence of Nature vs. Nurture here. This movie has really made me realize how much Kubrick enjoys exploring duality in the human essence
“this movie is a bit unusual really"  – my confused and slightly alarmed roommate
I liked this so much less this time around. I just felt that it didn't have much to say, however visually stunning it might be. If you're going to be about violence I feel like you need to have something worth saying.
he need some MILK (i thought of this and then saw that someone else did too and now i’m sad)
Seriously? Did I miss something?
Stanley Kubrick’s ‘A Clockwork Orange’ is a controversial, provocative and offensive masterpiece about the art of violence. This is an interesting film to study if you’re new or familiar with Kubrick’s filmography. Most people that have already seen the film hold some strong opinions regarding this story with a wide variety of responses to the darker material displayed throughout. The film is often regarded as one of the most controversial films ever made and there’s some genuine truth to that statement. After revisiting the film, I still have some minor issues with it, but the experience is undoubtedly a satisfying cinematic revelation. Kubrick has a unique method in which he tells his stories about violence without actually exploiting them or exaggerating them. In ‘Dr. Strangelove’, violence and war is frequently discussed but we never see a violent act until the final flurry of atomic bombs exploding in the background. In ‘2001’, HAL 9000 terminates an entire crew in a chilling way as we see a computer screen indicating the loss of life. Now, with this film, Kubrick actually shows us a story centered around violence, but directed in an artistic way that is still impressive to this day. The film centers on Alex, the dark soul of a leader with his gang of 'droogs’ set in a near future dystopian version of Great Britain. The gang moves from one location to the next terrorizing their victims, putting them through outrageous acts of violence including fighting, rape and murder. When two of his ‘droogs’ refuse to follow Alex’s path of destruction, he turns on them and beats them senseless. There’s a turn of events against Alex as he’s taken down by the medical industry who decides to “reform” his formerly sociopathic tendencies with a controversial treatment. Once Alex is cured, he faces a chain of humiliating evets that continually beat him down. He’s now being attacked by his former associates, the police, even some of his prior victims. Sometimes the cure is far worse than the illness as Alex learns the hard way that karma can indeed be a cruel bitch. There’s a level of appreciation to the affection and habitué concepts of the story, as well as the types of questions it raises for us as the audience. The film lends itself to many psychological ideologies about freedom, choice, good versus evil and selfishness which is quite thought-provoking. Despite the complete inability to relate to Alex as a character, there’s a carefully crafted layer of self-exploration that I’ve always found fascinating in this film. Malcom McDowell’s performance as the lead felt hauntingly authentic, there’s isn’t a moment where his character feels like he’s pretending, or even acting for that matter, it’s very convincing and commanding. Kubrick's direction is handled masterfully throughout the film and it shows, his presence is made in every frame as the overall presentation of the film does a remarkable job of sucking you into this horrible dystopian world with a great attention to detail. The film’s only real detriment is due to its own controversy which is indeed disturbing in nature and not intended for everyone to see, I understand that. The disturbing tone of the film is vital to its execution, it doesn’t hold back at all, even during the fighting, killings and especially the rape scenes which makes it an incredibly difficult film to watch let alone recommend to others. I find rare films with such a disturbing nature like this fascinating and is one of the reasons why I can always appreciate a filmmaker that isn’t afraid to hold back. Cinematic storytelling can be thought-provoking and immoral, but a lot of complaints about the film is that it goes too far and damages the viewer, to each their own there. Kubrick is a filmmaker that should be studied as his films offer incredible transcendent experiences, ‘A Clockwork Orange’ just happens to burn a hole in your conscience in the process. As I said before, the criticism the film receives for being controversial and offensive is understandable, I may not feel that same way, but I get it. I understand the strong opinions about the film as they are all over the board with reactions. After this recent rewatch, I still consider the film to be one of Kubrick’s better works and should be given a screening by any cinephile or aspiring filmmaker that’s willing to give it a chance. See it for yourself, don’t let any outside influence dictate that decision for you. Like most of Kubrick’s films, relying on someone’s opinion doesn’t really do his cinematic experiences any justice as a lot of his films are self-exploratory. I wouldn’t just watch it only because it’s controversial or offensive, you should watch it for its darker essence of artistic merit. Overall, ‘A Clockwork Orange’ is a dramatically difficult to watch but visually impressive social satire. The film has comedic moments, torturous scenes, deconstruction of musicals during a horrifying rape, it’s a hybrid of material and definitely not an easy film to categorize. It may feel out of time and out of place, but it’s a stunning portrayal of the art of violence and nearly impossible to take for granted. Kubrick’s approach to this subject matter is handled excellently with masterful direction and thought-provoking concepts of this dystopian version of the near future. This is a film that can and should be studied, this is a film that demands multiple screenings, this is a film that challenges your perspective on art and violence, this is pure, modernistic cinema.
The power of the internet is powerful
Proof positive above all else that Kubrick had bigger yarbles than you, if you even have yarbles. Read Anthony Burgess’ book in high school and first saw this in college. Disagreed with the notion that it glorified violence but wondered if I still would, and if so why. I still do, and the answer is that Kubrick knows precisely how much distance to place between you and his subject: what to show, what not to show and exactly how to do both. Everything that you do see is exaggerated beyond belief, from the supporting performances to the wide angle lenses and especially the production design, a deliberately garish bastard child of brutalism and pop art. However, Kubrick keeps the camera cool and collected, and even when he puts it in the thick of the action it feels somehow removed. Interestingly, we’re never really with Alex anytime he follows the old ultraviolence through to completion; we cut to the next scene after he wraps up “Singin’ in the Rain”, and in other cases Kubrick moves to a safe distance to spare us the details. Even in the attack on the old woman, arguably the most Kubrick lets us partake in the proceedings, the killing blow is depicted symbolically rather than literally. It’s a clever strategy, one that lets the audience see Alex’s evil without turning them off from following his journey. Yet despite that, and despite Malcolm McDowell’s extraordinary charisma, the Nadsat conlang of Burgess’s text keeps you from empathizing with him; it’s hard to connect to a guy when you have to actively figure out what he’s saying. With all these pieces in place, Kubrick has free reign to mount maybe his single most daring movie, boldly transposing Burgess’ questions of morality and free will to make the fullest exploration of his own themes: power, control and dehumanization. It’s a deeply disturbing vision, one only accentuated by his post-2001 comfort with ambiguity, so is it any surprise it set off people’s alarm bells? Argue over its validity or coherence all you want, we’ve been doing so for almost fifty years now and we’re not stopping anytime soon. Real horrorshow.
Loved it. Malcolm McDowell’s performance is really something to behold. I can imagine being given a role like this at 27 years old must have been quite the physical and mental undertaking. Also, I loved the “easter eggs” thrown in. And no, I’m not just talking about the one in the music shop scene. If you know your Kubrick, you’ll pick up on some more obscure ones.
70s interior decorations: the most disturbing part of this film.
I liked this more than I liked The Shining, can’t wait to read the book. Never would I have thought this would be one of my new favorite psychological thrillers.
This movie is horrific and wild trip. Even crazier now than when I first saw it. Still it’s hard not to love a bit of the old ultraviolence.
What if Monty Python was dark, tedious, and shitty?
this is a movie about how white boys are the root of all evil
No, a clock works with gears! Art direction, cinematography, camera work: nice The script and any time the characters converse in their silly British way: yawn
Yeah, I have no idea. It’s violently unpleasant, but extremely stylish and uses music super well, and it has a provocative message that it explicitly spells out for you at the expense of having literally anything else to grasp onto. I’m sure it’s much, much better than I’ll give it credit for
A rich and disturbing dystopia with exceptional attention to detail in production design and costume, incredibly edited, great soundtrack and extraordinary performance from Malcolm McDowell.   While there is a lot of graphic content in this film, for me, It’s the film sympathies that makes this such a highly disturbing experience. From the beginning, the film imbues Alex with a sense of charismatic everymanship. We follow him and watch his horrific acts, and the film continues to treat him his way. We follow him through the corrupt and immoral prison and rehabilitation system as his sadistic spirit is crushed, we follow him in his desperation and fear during his comuppances. We are horrified, at ourselves and the society on film, because we remain by his side.  We understand him and his world and that is what makes him terrifying. For me, the film is ultimately great because it centers the questions of freedom and order on a character rather than a society. 🥛
I’d been dying to see this film for a while. As a film major, it was quite criminal that I HADN’T seen this yet. So leave it to my Film History class to show it as curriculum!  First off, let me just voice the fact that I was not disappointed. This movie was just as weird as I anticipated it to be.  Kubrick’s use of imagery and sound really helped contribute to just how bizarre of an experience watching this movie was. From the sexually charged milk bar Alex and his droogs frequent, to theseemingly trashed apartment complex Alex lives in, to the almost overwhelming synthesized background music, everything about the sets and sounds had me consistently wondering what I was supposed to be watching. I’m aware A Clockwork Orange was supposed to be an overwhelming film, and it certainly lived up to that standard. Next to that, aside from it’s surrealness, the movie was also really successful in making me sympathize with a character who would otherwise be seen as villainous. Alex was a rapist, an assaulter, a murderer, and a vandal. Yet after he went through the therapy, and after everybody he wronged came back to make his life hell, I couldn’t help but feel bad for him. He probably deserved it, but at the same time, I couldn’t help but root for him a little. It was a very odd sensation for me; I normally have a low tolerance for people who commit those kinds of acts, but Kubrick did well in making sure I felt something for Alex.
Rewatched for the umpteenth time because Bowie’s Nadsat song from Blackstar got me in the mood.  Still wonderful, still hypnotic, still has a woman dying from giant, artsy, ornamental Penis. In fact, I’d dare go so far as to say giant, artsy, ornamental penis/10
A pretty faithful adaptation on Anthony Burgess’ novel that also happens to be a cinematic masterpiece. Visually striking, sickening, thought-provoking, and intriguing, this is one of my favorite Stanley Kubrick films and one that I’ll have to rewatch to pick up any details I may have missed during the first viewing.
A crazy world for a mixed up time, don't mess with the symphony. A film that takes you outside yourself and inside a mind that is at once mad and sane, knowing and yet naive. Powerful and needing more than one viewing to appreciate just what it is you've just seen
What didn't click Stanley? What didn't click
An amazing movie. It’s very dark, disturbing and....ultra violent. One of Kubrick’s best films, and one of the best character studies in film. A must watch.
Stanley Kubrick is a true master: every shot was amazing and I couldn’t take my eyes off this journey through a fucked up society and mind.
Much more enjoyable on second watch, and a bit more clear in my head, but I still feel I can't like "A Clockwork Orange" as much as the majority. But it still intrigues me and I'll probably be back to it. This time I got a new appreciation for the cinematography and that fucking score. Simply incredible.
This is the third film I’ve seen from Kubrick and he continues to prove that he’s my favorite director.  A Clockwork Orange presents a dark and disturbing futuristic scenario where groups of hoodlums roam the streets at night, assaulting anyone who crosses their path. The progression of the story and the way it made me feel was remarkable. It honestly felt like a different film going into the second act but I loved it so much. The fact that I could still feel sympathy for the main character after everything he had done just proves the genius of this film. Kubrick is 3 for 3 so far where perfect films are involved, and I’m hoping this streak will keep going. Please check this film out, but don’t expect to feel any sort of positive emotion. 10/10
An absolute masterpiece that I simply can’t praise in my own words.
Technically? Brilliant, Kubrick ennit? Ideologically? Not so much. Confused ain't I?
🏴‍☠️🔸👁🃏🕑🔶 Clockwork Orange:    "..has the appearance of an organism lovely with colour and juice but is in fact only a clockwork toy to be wound up by God or the Devil...”  it isnt the best movie ever...it’s the weirdest.
heck yes. as dope as i thought it would be.
the part of my brain that registers bastard men as attractive didn't turn off :// Alexander DeLarge call me :///
Absolutely nothing needs to be said about this. It would just seem trite to go on about it being a masterpiece-which it is-and if I added any more to what every one who's a fan already knows, it wouldn't make it any more or less true.
Stanley Kubrick did that, period but doesn’t mean I liked it. A thought pervoking movie that is real disturbing and graphic, it really deals with important topics but it’s a slog to get through. Violence is bad, but brainwashing someone so they can’t get violent at all is also bad and problematic. Criminal reform is hard to achieve, but the way things played out in this movie was not it. Gotta give points to Stanley Kubrick for the ambition on display as always.
It's a very important work of art. High points: Everything. It's flawless. Low points: Nothing. It's flawless.
Some nice Kubrick shots and compositions...BUT overall probably one of my least favorite Kubrick films.
stop making like seriously criminal characters hot i'm going to lose it! nice satire and also nice posing of ethics in psychology
My dad says this is the most sick and twisted movie he's ever seen, yet I think this is my favorite Kubrick film, thereby saying it's one of my favorite films period. Yikes. Engaging from start to finish. The closest to reality, yet with enough detail to give it a fantastic nature to it. Alex is perhaps the Anti-Hero of all anti-heros. If I were still in school and I were just *forced* to write a comparison or change over time essay regarding some characters, I'd look at how Alex influenced the character type of the Anti-Hero [namely that of Hannibal in The Silence of the Lambs??]. I digress. The use of violence in the movie is quite different to what we see today. Rather than make everything hyper-realistic or ultra-grotesque, Kubrick pulls some fancy tricks. He speeds things up. He overlays circus music over the acts. He inserts bits of comedic dialogue. He uses a wide-angled lens, from Alex's vantage point mostly, to signify a POV, which gives the viewer itself a sort of detached look at the violence. Put that with everything else and it almost makes the violence come off as a charade, separate from the reality of what's really going on in the film. Still, some of the violence makes me ill and no, I'll never be able to listen to Singin' in the Rain thanks to this movie.
This movie was immensely disquieting to say the least. A very compelling story. The main character, Alex, has got to be one of the most complex and intriguing movie psychopaths. Love this movie.
well.... i had to watch this for a film studies project and um the cinematography and plot was really good so i guess i liked it??? alex looked like evan peters which was strange so thats all i got folks
one of the weirdest films I’ve ever watched but I still liked it I think, kubrick had a very unique and creative mind  *if they ever remake this (hopefully not) they really need to cast evan peters as alex because that resemblance is mad
the concept of how a violent government perpetuates a violent society is very topical in today’s political environment, but Jesus Kubrick you really dislike/hate women huh?
it’s just... gratuitous.  Directing and cinematography? Great.  Narrative? Long, trope-y, shocking for the sake of being shocking in some parts, doesn’t really work nowadays.  I’m sorry Kubrick, but not a fan of this one.
A Clockwork Orange isn’t even a horror movie but somehow it manages to disturb me more than any horror movie ever could.
Morally repugnant and juvenile; inarguably, one of the worst things to happen to the medium. (Burgess's animosity towards this is entirely justified in my eyes.) Disheartening that generations of film-goers will grow up enslaved to the ludicrous notion that Kubrick is some infallible genius. He isn't.
lol I’m learning about classical and operant conditioning in psychology class right now
Well, I wasn't floored. There was violence that nearly 50 years ago felt controversial, today it feels okay. There are a few standout sets and scenes, and it's now felt like watching a master direct in peak form. I watched the Shining the day before and the Shining is still in my thoughts. This surely won't hold a large place for me, mainly because the characters growth or decline wasn't something I cared about, violence for fun never makes a character appealing, I had hoped I'd say more layers out of the personality, the narration given sounds numbed, or as if I'm in on something. I did, initially, find three fight scenes not brutal but pointless, and pointless violence can frighten.
Michelle Handleman’s Must Watch List #3  The set, the score, and the cinematography were the best things about this film. Other than that I wasn’t really into it.
absolute bangey wangey my brothers and sisters
"It's funny how the colours of the real world only seem really real when you viddy them on the screen."  This was one of the first films I watched when I started to get into film in sixth grade... and it terrified the shit out of me when I was that young. It still does
Really forgot how unsettling this movie is, whoa man
This film is fantastic and all, but I'm just so curious about that Vampire version of Alex. I swear if there was just one full scene with him as a vampire, this would be the best film ever.
I'm not sure what to say about this movie other than that the 2nd time watching it I understood everything much better. Which oddly enough goes for every one of Stanley Kubricks films
Am I a bad film hoe or is this...not good?
I’ve been thinking about Alex saying “eggiwegs...” for like two days now.  My mom once told me this was her favorite movie, which is just about the coolest.
The cogney accents are stronger than I remember
One of the greatest movies of all time in my opinion. Liked it after the first watch, absolutely loved it after the second time. It's so shocking and horrifying that it's somehow so addicting. Could not watch this movie enough.
Now I see what all the hype is about! Kubrick created a masterpiece. It was in your face, it was frightening, but I loved it. Anyone who loves to see karma bite someone in their ass would love this classic. You would also love this film if you enjoy absolute craziness! It is not politically correct at all so soft eyes probably would not care for this film but damn what a watch. The vision and camera work is incredible, but I mean what else do you expect from Kubrick? Hell of a movie for its time, definitely a must see.
This movie makes you wish you've seen it sooner. Everything about it is godlike, the pacing, the downward spiral of Alex's life, the flawless ending. Highly recommend
This movie is fucking sensational. Released in 1971 and banned in many countries until 2000 - A Clockwork Orange is as vicious and hypnotic as ever in 2018. Start to finish, this film just instantly blows me away. The narrator, Alex, is ferociously menacing and purely evil, yet still you can't help but be pulled into his world viewpoint and even feel sorry for him in places. How the visuals of this film come together with its immersive score and superbly crafted narration is a delight to behold. There is no dead weight, no throwaway moments. Everything feels perfected. The film's events are also completely realistic and natural. I have seen this film many times, but it is still impactful and horrific in places. It is also nice to see the entire film turn upside down in the second half. If you haven't seen it, then you've been living under a rock. And if you have, then going back will only remind you of its great power.
Am I your typical film student yet
alex: I came here to drink milk and kick ass... and I’ve just finished my milk
Another day, another film that tries to get you to sympathize for some terrible white man
I would not recommend reading the book before watching the movie, as I did. It's not a bad book by any measure, and I would absolutely recommend it, but Kubrick does a much better job of telling this story and espousing these ideas than Burgess. Apart from the portrayal of music and the parents, this surpasses the book in almost every way. Reading it first took much of the shock and confusion away from the film, and being that the film is far superior, this is very disappointing.      Even though I knew it was coming, I was still physically sickened by the first HOME scene.    I'm especially impressed by how Kubrick was able to encapsulate the last 10 or so pages within a single shot.   I'd like to watch this again when the book isn't so fresh in my mind, I imagine I'll enjoy it more.
A vile, grotesque, and relentless examination of the most barbaric and primal state of humanity. The score is ominous and perfect. The visuals are incredible, Kubrick’s futuristic dystopian aesthetic and combined with gritty and often snuff-like cinematography make A Clockwork Orange one of the most uncomfortable and detestable masterpiece ever created in the history of cinema.
nope. i am a firm believer that no film ever needs to include rape scenes, and kubrick is no exception to that rule. it’s just not okay. there’s a million other ways that it can be communicated without showing it, and it’s totally inconsiderate of survivors of abuse. not to mention the way women are objectified in general in this movie, yikes. people will undoubtedly say ‘but this was 1971, we can’t judge it by today’s standards’. but guess what? we can actually. it wasn’t okay then, and it isn’t okay now. sure, it came out a few decades ago, but if people keep giving films like this 5 stars, talking them up, and hanging the posters in their college dorm rooms then they are still as much a relevant cultural icon as any film that came out recently. and then the messed up messages it sends keep circulating in the world. we have to hold art accountable, even if it’s influential and lots of people like it.
This movie narrates a story of Karma: all the actions return to the doer, without any merci.
I continue to be struck by how much the man inside the Darth Vader costume once resembled a brolic Austin Powers. An incredibly immersive dystopia, this. The psychologist in the hospital with the word bubble test made me realize stan kubes predicted "space hair" two years after woodstock. Srsly tho it's real horrorshow how I'd almost rather have this world than mine due to its general lack of guns
Nothing I can say will do it justice, but alas, A Clockwork Orange is a brilliant satire on government and free will that is both entertaining and thought provoking in equal measures.  Grade: A
good thing i'm lactose intolerant
“Singin’ in the Rain” is better in this than in Singin’ in the Rain
Clever and organized but, compelling? Not really.
My ass hurts
Although I liked the music, the allegory and symbolism, the first half and the fact that it's a technically fantastic film, it really didn't hit me in any remarkable way. I really didn't feel anything, some parts were just straight up stupid and some of it was quite boring.
Mind, blown. Not for the squeamish. Or illiterate.
i wish i talked like this    turkey
I hate to trot out the old "________ is as relevant as ever..." refrain but is any movie apter for reexamination in our infinitely screwed up socio-political moment than A Clockwork Orange? In an age of ever-present white male violence and governments actively looking to reprogram its damaged populace with its own levers of cultural brutality- aided in large part to psychiatric drugs intended to suppress rather than substantially reform- Stanley Kubrick's 1971 tightly wound confection of unpleasantness continues to enact its terrors on eyeballs hopelessly laid bare to a world on the brink of collapse. Our definitions of authoritarianism have undergone significant revisions since the early 70s yet the acuity with which Kubrick critiques institutional terrorism as a reaction to, or quite possibly a root cause of, societal ills remains bone-chilling in its accuracy. However, this is not to suggest that A Clockwork Orange's rejection of its existence on an ideological spectrum vacillating between the tyrannical and the anarchic excuses the film for the flawed vision of the world's enactors of political violence it at times smugly dramatizes. The distance with which Kubrick frames his adaptation of Anthony Burgess's novel throws us into the action with little in the way of guide rails or signposts. Do not get me wrong, I love it when art challenges me personally without telling me exactly what or how to think. However, I also expect the work in question to take some measure of responsibility for the actions or expressions of the elements in play, something that I never feel as if the movie ever accomplishes much less expresses any interest in attempting. If anything, the remove with which Kubrick engages in the material grant an ever-refreshing modernity to a film that could easily date itself as little more than a talented auteur taking a stab at the flower children running amuck and the necessary measures employed to keep them in line. As it stands, A Clockwork Orange has stood the test of time as an unfortunately timeless valentine to dystopias large and small. Yay?
this shit wild but
I'm speechless...It's one of the weirdest films I have EVER seen and at the same time one of the most beautiful too. Malcolm McDowell gives easily his best performance as Alex, one of the most cruel but interesting characters of all time. Cinematography is very beautiful and directing is indescribably great. Anyway, I know this film absolutely isn't for everyone but please give a change for it, because it's so important piece of the history of motion picture and one of my favorite films of all time. 10/10
I'M SIIIIIINNNNGING IN THE RAIIIIN
While I can call this his weakest film overall, especially given the fact that I loved 2001: A Space Odyssey and The Shining, Stanley Kubrick's approach to A Clockwork Orange (1971) offers plenty of interesting visuals and a stylized way of seeing the story of one teenage boy learning the consequences and the true meaning of ultra-violence. Granted. The rape scenes were overkill and there were some many scenes I thought were so over the top and lame, but looking past aside those issues, the film can be watchable after at least 3 times.
It seems like this is one of those movies you just HAVE TO HAVE SEEN--right up there with STAR WARS and GONE WITH THE WIND. The thing is, I'd never seen it until it was in my FilmStruck library. Of course, I had read the book. Of course, I knew every reference David Bowie made to the work (so, droogie, don't crash here). Of course, I "got" every reference to this film as it was portrayed in other media...like the seemingly-endless references to it, in the 90s, on "The Simpsons." I just didn't know how DAMN GOOD it would be until I actually watched it. I didn't know how TERRIFIED it would make me. As a lover of classical music, this hit me more than anything else: Ludwig van's Ninth was a symphony highly influenced by the Enlightenment. And it's beloved by Alex, this child of a future, this evolved (but in what way?) being. And, to enlighten him, it's used to condition him. AND OH MY GOD THAT SCARED THE CRAP OUT OF ME.
I appreciate this more after distancing it from the novel
A controversial classic to be sure, but a classic none the less. One of the best book adaptations out there
A very good professional piece of cinnie. I viddy much enjoyed viddying this. And I talk like this now, my brothers
This was a less subtle Kubrick for me. The acting and directing were top notch, but the themes were too point blank for me. Still a good movie though.
It’s a shame I didn’t understand one thing of the book, because the movie is so great!!!
Really wonders what happens if we humans lose or right to be moral beings Such an amazing and profound movie, one of my favorite movies of all time
it was sick
In my opinion, Kubrick's greatest film. Period. Full stop. The cinematic features of the film and Malcolm McDowell's performance make this a film no movie buff will want to miss.
I think there’s supposed to be like seven sins or some shit but let’s be real the only sin that exists is rating this anything other than 5 stars  There’s also a really great short little documentary about the movie on the blu ray give it a watch if you’re a fucking worthless friendless piece of shit like me :)
Bursting with social commentary on topics from prison reform to gay rights, this film is one of Kubrick’s finest. 9.5/10
DISCLAIMER!!! I’m a sick motherfucker. So a sick motherfucking movie is just gonna click with me. I’m sorry, it’s just going to happen. I don’t know what else I can do for you.  This is one of the most weird, crazy, and “was the director on drugs” movie I’ve seen in a long time. For the first thirty minutes, you have absolutely no idea what’s going on. I love it. The opening scene gets me hooked immediately, with its distorted “For the Funeral Of Queen Mary” piece by Henry Purcell. You put that masterpiece with a scene of four weirdos with hats, and eyelashes, drinking milk on furnature made out of naked women manicans. That’s how you get me interested, IMMEDIATELY. The next scenes include beating up a homeless person, a rape scene, a gang fight, a rape scene, a teenager sleeping with a snake to Beethoven, an old man grabbing a teens balls, a sex scene, a fight, and almost another rape scene. AND THEN THE MOVIE BEGINS!  When Alex goes to prison, I start to feel really interested in him and what’s going on around him. This guy who seemed just like an absolute psychopath is started to show some composed personality. While this is happening I’m hoping that he becomes a better person, but while I’m hoping this, it seems the people around Alex get worse, and now it feels like Alex is the definitive protagonist. When he leaves prison his life becomes a living hell and suddenly I just fall in love with his character and I want him to succeed and it breaks my heart when bad thins happen to him.  I have no idea what this movie is about. It could be “is religion the only way to good morality” is it “the government is more evil than the evil doers themselves” is it “men are naturally born evil” Either way, the music is the best out of any movie and I know I’m being a little bit biased because my favorite piece “William Tell Overture” is in it. Three times, but this movie is super entertaining, in a way super meaningful, and I love the main character and his setting.  This definitely isn’t the fourth best movie in the world, but it certainly is my fourth favorite. I can rewatch it everyday. 5/5.
funny this works. largely because of mc dowell. appropriate for vacation with more and more violent films.
