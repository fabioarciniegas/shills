It’s pretty neat and innovative so go figure.
Saw this film on Thanksgiving, and I am thankful for it. I believe every movie from a foreign country should show you what that country's electrical outlets look like, and this movie fulfills that desire.
I went into Border not knowing a single thing about it. I feel that is the best way to experience this film. Border is a wonderful, if a bit disturbing, love story. It’s quite the unique love story because it is also part Dark fantasy. This film is beautiful looking, the fantastic lighting and lovely scenery makes it feel wild and free, implying that our main character, Tina, wants to be. The performances are incredible, especially from the lead Eva Melander. She able to show a wide range of emotions through the makeup she is encased in. The makeup is also fantastic, I thought that they really looked like that in real life, but then I realized how hard it would’ve been to find two actors who look like this and can act well. This definitely needs an Oscar for makeup. My only problems with the flick is the editing, the film editing is quite jarring with its quick cuts. And the whole film is hand cammed as well, and its purpose is clear in some scenes but not in others. Border is beautifully dark with a B-Plot that ties in fantastically in the end.
When I saw the trailer I thought, "this looks super weird, I'm so ready for this!" I wasn't ready for this.
Yo what the fuck? This sure is something different, and I prefer the more out there, ambitous and just flat out weird stuff to the generic multimillion dollar studio movies, so it gets point for being... Unique. This is a strange mix of nordic noir, fantasy, romance, and some comedy if you look at it the right way. Sometimes these things all combine to make something great, more often the tones clash and makes the entire thing not all too coherent. The makeup work is great. When I saw the trailer I thought they must have found some weird looking people with slightly disfigured faces who also also turned out to be actors. But no, the main chacaters are some fairly well know and respected scandinavian actors with a ton of great makeup work. It never feels fake, you believe it for the most part. For the most part because, for 2 scenes, things get reaaaally wacky. At one point what we assumed to be a guy-troll gives birth to some creatuee only slightly less disgusting than the baby from Eraserhead. Okay that was a weird but sort of intriguing twist. Then we get maybe the weirdest sex scene ever? The girl-troll just... Grows a dick. Much to her own horror I might add. It looks fucking weird and goofy and disgusting and kinda takes you out of it. Ultimately I am still not sure if I liked these scenes of if they are "good", but they sure are interesting and will stay with me for a while so thered that. Most scenes, in themselves, were enjoyable. Some even worked great together, mostly the (family) drama stuff. But when it trier to bring together the thriller and romance plots things get a bit too much and it ultimately derails the whole film. We are left with a film that doesnt have a whole lot to say but was a fun ride to be on for the most part. If "weird" is something you like in films and are interested in independent small films thst are more slow character dramas, sure check this out if you can. If anything else, you won't miss anything if you skip this one. Except for some of the best makeup work ever?
Certain elements of the plot mesh a bit awkwardly, but this is still one hell of a strange time at the movies. To even disclose precisely what genre it is would be a spoiler.....so I’ll say no more.

There were moments of this movie that felt truly liberating. Oh, and Eva Melander is nothing short of groundbreaking with her extremely physical and feral, yet also restrained performance.
acting is great, the world is cool, a few good scenes but the plot is kind of a wreck, and doesn’t add up to much. i don’t think the characters were used to their full potential.
I’ve been excited about this movie for a while because it was written by the guy who wrote Let The Right One In, a movie I absolutely loved when I was a junior in high school, but Border is basically the same movie but not as good? Structurally this is the same as it anyway, most of this movie is a standard “ugly people have feelings too” kind of movie, but it feels more genuine than your average Hollywood take on this. I just felt like I was watching something that I had already seen. The third act becomes a thriller, and I wish that was the entire movie because it felt like something new, something I hadn’t seen before. So much of this movie just feels like Let The Right One In, but without vampires. Once the first twist in the film is unraveled, it definitely picks up and has some interesting elements. Ending kinda sucks though, so there’s probably a solid half an hour I really like in here, everything else just felt derivative. Gotta give props to this movie for how weird it gets, and holy shit some of effects (excluding the CGI moose) looked really great and saying what they are would spoil it.  Overall pretty disappointed with this film even though it has a lot of amazing elements to it, but so much of it feels dry and created already. It’s nowhere near a bad movie, just disappointing if you are a fan of Let The Right One In and wanted the writer to go in a new direction.
Enjoyed the oddness and magical realism, but not quite sure I understood the thesis.  IFC Center
An incomparable experience, for worse or for better.
I'm just here for the growly troll sex.
An enchanting dark fairy tale. Reminds me of upstream color or under the skin, portraying a world both magical and completely recognizable. A thoughtful, challenging, and mood inducing film.
The movie has two plots: the one that's described about a customs officer that can smell emotions and whose life is thrown when she meets a strange drifter. And a less talked about subplot about an investigation of a paedophilia ring. At first it's a strangely beautiful love story and a late blooming coming of age tale that's one of the most unique films I've seen. Then it decides to marry the two plots and in the process loses sympathy for pretty much every character and doesn't resolve the only plot point I'm interested in at that point. 2/3rds of a great film let down by a messy ending.
Refreshing. Although i pegged it early and often still it was truly fun to watch unfold. Ps. After reading other reviews i see part of enjoying it more was being more aware of the mythology but i dont think is necessary, just dont try to read it as an american "ugly but beautiful inside" thing
A tough film to review. Unpleasant and unsettling, though unquestionably skillfully made and even touching at times. But I think delving so deeply and minutely into the mythology of this world is a mistake. By doing so, the underlying metaphor for the alienation, abuse and exploitation of the ‘other’ in society (whether based on class or race or religion or nationality or sex or orientation) is lost in revelations of more and more weirdness. When an audience is challenged not to look away, sometimes they will - or wish they had - and resent being forced to choose.
Excellent acting propels a deeply interesting story; the makeup is icing on the cake, with some daring do in the form of closeups and scenes where the actors submerge themselves.
One of the weirder movies I've seen this year. It's almost like a live action gritty fairy tale.
The feel-weird — REALLY weird — love story of the year. Or it could have been had it explored the sweetness rather than simply exploiting its oddities. It’s like a superficial spin on the ideas of alienation, isolation and temptation found in “Let the Right One In” and a halfhearted parable about gender fluidity rolled together — with an utterly distasteful thriller turn that is pointless until, well, it isn’t. For a movie so gentle as far as physical violence goes, there is something aggressively offputting here, which could have worked if only it weren’t so emotionally removed.
Going into a movie blindly is lost art nowadays. We've become handicapped from a pure experience by the endless stream of trailers and sneak peeks. If you were ever to stay away from those crutches, it should be with this film, where the old adage rings true, the less you know, the better. Border is a really good film. It, at least, has all the cliche parts of a really good film. Good cinematography, direction, writing, editing are all present here. But there was one thing that kept me from writing about this film for so long. It took me the better part of a month to realize how damn original Border is. At this point, the pretentious in you is yelling "Nothing is original!". And maybe in themes, no, it is not original. But there is something about an immersion that is hard for movies to achieve. Yet, Border did that. Border sucks you into this world and forces you to sympathize with the characters. It forces you, in disbelief, to realize that maybe we aren't that different while still tackling the tough concepts of loneliness, angst, and understanding. Please don't watch the trailers. Please don't read the synopsis. Please go in there blind and let the movie consume you.
Quite thought-provoking. Visually beautiful. Engaging plot.
Didn’t completely love Border, but it’s unapologetically weird as hell and I respect that.
Glad to see the Geico cavemen get work. Really tho, this is bonkers!!
There is one clear message that Gräns communicates, and that is: humanity is a fucked up species. And we all know this to be a legitimate argument, so it's good to be reminded of it, as a member of the human race. However, there are multiple ways to show such a message, and here start my troubles with the film. I'll quickly rewind to get to my point... Gräns is one of the weirdest love stories I've ever seen, but it's cute, in its own twisted way. This is where its power lies in, in this alternative view of life and experience; so as a result we can reflect on our own existence. Unfortunately, towards the end, the audience is not trusted anymore to make its own judgement on these points. The film decides to depart from its nuances, and instead simply shows and tells what it was about all along.
NEON is slowly becoming my favorite studio. In their short life they've given us Colossal, Beach Rats, Ingrid goes west, I tonya, Border, Three Identical Strangers, Vox Lux and now this? A24 WHO? That being said I didn't lLOVE this. And I was sure I would. I think I expected more and idk what I was expecting tbh. But that doesn't mean this wasn't good. I love weird ass movies.. and this one deff is one of the weirdest I've seen this year. Fantastic performances from the two leads covered in make up and you still felt what they were feeling and going through. The best way I can describe this is an adult fantasy movie/ thriller/ drama man its so weird to describe this. Its a blend of many genres and it succeeds. It kept me at the edge of my seat and it just kept getting weirder and weirder. I really didn't know where it'd go. Despite me saying I didn't love it, I really enjoyed it and I appreciate them making these type of movies. Keep them coming NEON.
After now seeing the 6th entry into the Best Foreign Language Film category I pity anyone who has to judge and rank this year’s best entries. Originality, Novelty, and blended narratives feature highly in the entries I’ve seen this year, and maybe more than any is this amazing film from Sweden.  Without being pedantic with important themes in this film, Abbassi at once tackles tough issues facing  the disenfranchised, the marginalized,  even the “Me Too Movement”, and completely novel observations on gender.  There are a few elements of Swedish lore and nomenclature that might escape the audience, but this surprisingly different film with an incredibly capable  cast  clearly gets its point across
Halfway through this movie I looked around the almost empty theater at the 4 or 5 other people that were there and asked myself, "Why the fuck are you people here? Why did you decide to come see this movie?" I was absolutely sure only 1 or 2 would last to the end. I was (gladly?) wrong. Border is best seen as cold as possible. If you must, watch the trailer and learn nothing else about it. It's about equal parts outrageous as it is conventional, which I think helps keep itself from eschewing into art house territory (and depending on your opinion, this is either for better or for worse). I really, really hate buzzwords, but I also really, really don't want to give much away. That said, it's hard to put it into one solid genre (genre-defying!). It's heartfelt, it's thrilling, but I think what most viewers seem to resonate with is the humanity of the film that defines its through-line. That humanity helps ground the more outrageous parts, and the simple, high-concept plot is helps the film maintain momentum while still keeping the main character's relatability. It's well written. That's what I'm trying to say. I wouldn't call the filmmaking necessarily "exceptional." Aside from the (fantastic) performances, no single aspect of the cinematography, blocking, editing, or sound design really stood out (okay, there was one scene where the shot went out of focus during a single, but it fit the emotion of the scene kinda so lets ignore, cool thank you). I suppose this isn't a bad thing. The film was really only trying to tell its story through the performances of the cast, so I wouldn't consider it a bad thing. You could almost call it sublime. Almost. While writing this review I kept leaning back and forth between 3 stars (out of 4, fuck you letterboxd for not allowing custom scales) and a full four stars. Does this film really deserve 4 stars? I think it warrants a second viewing to decide. 3 out of 4 stars. Border is a great film, best experienced knowing next to nothing about it. While it probably doesn't make for a compelling review, I would highly recommend this movie. If you can see it in theaters before Oscar season, you probably should.
A wonderfully thoughtful picture with some dark ideas and some even darker observations on morality. The film appears to be a simple tale of a border patrol agent who happens to excel at sniffing people out. At the core of it, however, is a startling love story that takes some very unusual turns. The Swedish country side has never been more appropriately used, at least in recent years. It's by the same writer as Let the Right One In, so you can probably imagine that not everything will be cleanly wrapped up and or simply put. Films like this make me question myself about many things. Do any of us truly know what it means to be human? What kind of a tight rope do we walk? Is it the same kind of border for all of us? As entertaining as it is challenging. Films like Border are the reason why I love movies. A vibrant, yet mysterious, film.
I really wanted to watch sweet romance and not a movie about queer trolls that make child pornography but that’s John A Lindqvist 4 u I guess :(
It takes some real innovation to take a movie about a cop who smells crime and make it tonally and thematically confused. I was kind of on board until about halfway through, when it starts wielding heavy subject matter such as child abuse like a thematic cudgel in order to say...something about how humans are bad? I'd have been much kinder to it if it had something to say at the end, rather than building up in the direction of a theme that never pays off. It's a movie with all setup, disappointing payoff.
A very special body horror episode of Law and Order: SVU
Sometimes being truly original is all it takes, though that's not all this film has going for it. Really though, considering the vast library of great films from decades past, the only thing that really interests me about modern filmmaking is innovation. That's obviously a broad term though and is meant as such, so that anything from technical innovation to subject matter is included. This film doesn't have much innovation in the former, but all the more in the latter. It's really a delightfully strange film, its surreal central metaphor/allegory resisting (at least for most of the film) any easy mapping onto the real world political landscape, apart from some very vague idea of "the other", and is all the better for it. The concept is so hard to explain, making very little sense, but that's really the core of the enjoyment for a good while. And once that novelty wears off a bit, the film gets very explicit and sensually provocative in ways that are even more delightful than what has come before. Keeping us occupied while all of that slowly develops is a b-plot that, while not superlative in any way, definitely serves as good filler and interesting character work. If I had to find faults with the film, it would have to be that its central premise does start to get more tangible and closer to real world analogues towards the end. This dampens the surrealism a bit and also presumably makes the film a bit more vulnerable to accusations of taking ownership of certain material that it perhaps can't entirely handle. There's also a coldness to the film, related to its commitment to its premise, making this more of an intellectual exercise than an empathetic one. That would be perfectly fine if it wasn't for the fact that this intellectual part is a bit weakened by the previously mentioned motions towards a more decipherable allegory. Still, these are very tiny flaws to one of the best and most original films of the year for me so far.
Very nice modern fairytale! The less you know about this before you see it, the better. I also enjoyed the (sporadic) electronic ambient soundtrack very much!
I don’t think I’ll ever forget that troll penis.
A disturbing fairy tale with themes of belonging and animalistic nature. Well acted and leaves you with a bit to think about.
#9: 28 FANCINE Nope
Weird done right. A troll living among humans in Sweden encounters another troll who attempts to recruit her to the troll revolution. Touching and effective. Top film of the year for me.
The "MoviePass Films" logo was hilarious. Also: Long shot for Best Makeup Oscar?
I did *not* see that coming.
An interesting premise and idea that is executed with certain finesse but slightly uneven approach. Solidly acted but a bit of uniformity in the direction would have been better for me
79/100 Underrated little gem of a film. Layered, focused and bold treatment of its subject matter. A rather involving thriller that feels fresh. KIFF Day 7 Film 24
Go into this knowing as little as possible. There's some loose ends that bother me, but I can't remember a movie that surprised me the way this one did. It goes to show that no matter how much you think you've seen it all...you really haven't. Not even close. And especially not here.
At it's core this movie is a romantic drama in the best sense, which I wasn't expecting. The chemistry between the two leads is so great.
This movie made me feel weird. Not because of the physical "ugliness" of the two main characters or anything they were shown doing, but rather the direction in which the story went. I tried to go into this knowing as little as possible, and I kind of kept wanting to go back to the movie where Tina took walks and calmly hung out with a fox and a moose in her backyard—perhaps so did she. Even still, there is a lot to appreciate and take in during this relatively short runtime, and I think it may take me a bit to unpack it all. Definitely see this if it's showing at a theater near you. And with MoviePass as a distributor, anyone with an open mind who hasn't cancelled their membership yet should use it to see this.
A beautifully bizzare exploration on identity  Coincidentally I recently caught up with both Let the Right One In and Let Me In after seeing a staged production of Let the Right One In and it was perfectly timed to prepare me for the writer's new film based on his short story. I loved this even more than both of those but they all have a beautiful connection of the other trying to connect with human society but their so called imperfections keep them distant. Eva Melander gives a truly stunning performance as Tina a troll who uses her heighten senses for good as a border guard inspecting bags and finding someone like her one day and connecting for the first time in her life to someone like her. She wears lots of make up for this role but the make up design and her tremendous acting ability are in perfect sync and she gets a lot of emotion out of her eyes and reactions over the make up. She wants to fit in with the human world buying groceries and living in a house with a human but still gets the side eye and called names but finally meets someone like her that makes her feel seen for who she is truly and even encourages her to embrace totally her troll side and turn on the humans. It's a really great meditation about identity and sense of purpose in the world. It's an impeccably directed and well written fairy tale like Let the Right One In and Let Me In were but I was taken with this even more and felt similar to The Shape of Water but getting the perspective from "the other". It also has some unforgettable shots and scenes involving the anatomy of these trolls. The screenplay is also really well plotted with twists and connection that make earlier scenes make much more sense if you are truly engaged and following along so I encourage you to seek this one out in a theater where you aren't distracted. One of my favorite foreign films of the year and hoping the Oscars remember it for Foreign Film and Make Up at the very least.
Can’t tell if this film is too weird to be taken seriously
Not sure how I feel about this one. I'm gonna think about it!
I'd give almost anything to be able to wipe this film from my memory.
Tina is a home owner and a dutiful daughter to her aging father. She is a TSA screener, or whatever the equivalent for that is in Sweden. Tina is very good at her job. She was actually born with a "chromosomal disorder" that enables her to smell contraband better than any human, possibly even better than most trained dogs. Not just any contraband, either. To say what she detects would spoil a big part of the enjoyment for the viewer but let's just say it is evident that Tina has some kind of superpower. Tina's chromosomal disorder also makes her about as far from traditionally beautiful as any woman can get. But she is beautiful and she knows it. She just hasn't met anyone she has ever felt in common with or who can honestly treat her as a romantic partner the way she deserves. And then she meets a tall dark stranger named Voge. Voge has similar abilities, and similar deficits. He has never been able to stay in one civilized place for very long, he is both more experienced and more dangerous. Just how experienced and just how dangerous Voge is is the centerpiece of the most suspenseful, bizarre and deeply satisfying mystery of the year. Looking for a double feature? Pair it with last year's best telekinesis movie of the year, Thelma from Norway's #JoachimTrier. So sayeth the King of Funny Faces.
if you plan on watching sweden’s oscar submission this year, i strongly recommend not to read any detailed reviews about the film. not because they are negative (the opposite in fact — 98% score on rotten tomatoes!) but because there are lots of plot reveals that will ruin the experience of watching this truly enchanting and original tale about identity and the mass anti-immigration hysteria that’s gripping the uninformed and ignorant among us. “border” won the un certain regard at cannes this year and tells the story of tina, a gifted border patrol agent whose heightened sense of smell can detect anyone who are hiding anything from the law. she’s different. she knows it. one day, she encounters a mysterious person who “looks” like her. she’s curious and she begins to question her identity. there’s a major revelation halfway through the movie followed by a scene never before depicted on screen that will leave you in complete and utter awe!  ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
Not since Let the Right One In has there been a story that so beautifully describes “otherness”
A touching modern fairy tale that touches on many different themes and ideas. Border certainly isn’t perfect but that’s ok, because it does so much that’s genuinely exciting. I’m trying to think of a way to explain why I love this film without spoiling it???  It grapples with so many different topics, but without losing focus. One thing I admire is the way it addresses issues like imperialism, racism and xenophobia while still remaining distinctly Scandinavian. Also as a trans person I was so excited by that scene at the airport. And the sex scene. There’s so much room for a queer reading here and if I ever write a more complete review of this film I’ll definitely be pursuing that.
this ain’t it
This was really weird and awesome. When I found out this was written by the same person who did Let The Right One In, I knew what to expect: Strange, Beautiful, Swedish.  Highly recommend this!  “Even when we find the one, we are still alone.” -my mom
Kinda loses it with the procedural stuff and there’s one major detail left unexplained related to Scandinavian mythology that the filmmakers seem to think is common knowledge when it is absolutely not, buuuut the parts of this that are simply about trying to live in the world and among people without collapsing in despair or boiling over in rage are assured and galvanizing. PS Everybody who says the sex scene was gross should be forced to tape and watch themselves having sex so they realize just how disgusting every single human body is we are monsters.
gives me nightmares just to think about it
Really wanted to like this for its admirable strangeness and ambition, but I just could not connect with the leads here, who seemingly walked straight from one of those caveman Geico ads and into a dreary, morose work of magical realism. Not without the occasional moment of intrigue (that sex scene is... a lot), and the craft is undeniably there, so you could very well cite a lack of taste for my finding this to be a bit of a slog.
Divisive narrative about living a non-mainstream life in a culture of others. Personally I liked the moral ambiguity and the gender fluidity. I like all of it, in fact. But then I have a pretty ambiguous relationship with the status quo. Your mileage may vary.
This was good but was all that stuff about children........ necessary
felt a lot of things and aroused was absolutely not one of them
I don’t know why everyone calls this so original and weird. It’s about trolls and that brings some weird (possibly made-up by Abbasi) mythology into play, but when you ignore that it’s quite a standard movie. Outcast meets outcast, they fall in love. Everything isn’t what it seems. It’s almost like the standard YA novel where the main protagonist discovers she truly is different, meets a guy who makes her see she’s beautiful and they go save the world. The last part isn’t exactly true here, so there I’d give it some points for originality. But if we go back to darker fairytales and myths it might not be that shocking either. Because of the standardness being the base of the story I got quite bored. I kind of found the whole detective part about child porn interesting, but in the end it doesn’t really feel wrapped up and it is only there to support the main arc, instead of working on its own. There also are some questions about what makes a monster, but that also feels pretty basic and has been asked in better movies before. So no... I absolutely don’t get why I see so much positivity surrounding this.
This movie is insane. Go into it knowing as little as possible. Just know that it has arguably the most bizarre sex scene you'll see in 2018.
The most disgustingest sex scene.
I love it when a film refuses to stick to a genre, but instead seamlessly glides from one set of imagery and rules to the next. Scandi-noir to fairy tale to family drama and back again. Similar in ambition to Let the Right One In, which is likewise based on a book by John Ajvide Lindquist.
Went into this blind and man was it a treat. The part of the film dealing with these outsiders finding each other and becoming close was really great. The performances from the two leads were incredible. The 2nd half of the film, while I liked it, did seem a bit too rushed. I wish it focused a bit more on these character's relationships before jumping into the more thriller-esque plot. Also, the ending was not necessarily bad but it was a bit predictable. I think my favorite part of the movie was the feeling it gives off; it has a mysterious, haunting, and beautiful tone which was very engrossing. Grade: B+
Nope. Absolutely the fuck not. Such a disgusting movie, so narrowly intent on grossing you out. It's used to kind of cool effect by the end, but it's in no way worth what the movie is clearly delighting in putting you through. Every five fucking seconds this movie made me gag. Not even just the literally gross stuff (eating maggots, fun!) but the whole vibe of the movie is just repulsive (see the continual use of child molestation as a plot point, they go out of their way to make it as gross as possible too). I get that the repulsion is part of the point, once the twist happens, but what follows I've seen many times before, *without* this much suffering. This movie delights in activating your gag reflex. I wish I'd walked out. Watched at AMC Sunset. The guy behind me straight up devoured chicken strips during this. Barf.
What begins as a modestly odd tale of isolation and otherness slowly unfolds into a truly strange and special exploration of trauma and identity in a way that I never expected. This is a profoundly weird movie, but it is profound, and I found myself hooked, despite some pacing issues that should have left me just a bit bored (but didn’t). It helps that even under the prosthetics and false teeth, both leads (Eva Milander and Eero Milonoff) give engaging performances.
Well anchored in its unique conception, Border can be tender and liberating, furious and disgusting, and even polemic in its vision of decaying humankind. In this case, and for its arresting visuals and compelling narrative, it’s easy to conclude that this is no minor work.
Chloe, the Director or Barketing at Moviepass, recommended this one to me!
All the makings of a weekly hour-long police procedural - "The Nose Knows" Next time I hear anyone mention the risqué sex scenes of Fifty Shades or nonsense like that, I'm just going to laugh and say they've seen nothing at all until they've seen troll sex.
On the border of inhumane and intimate. I thought I understand what Ali was going for until the second half where everything I tried to rationalize was flipped and turned into a twisted fantasy.  But I would say they somewhat eased into it but that’s when I was lost on what to take away from the film. Update: I think I’ve digested it now I love the way it portrayed differences in humanity and how it separates us and shows the animalistic nature of humans in the way they treat eachother. It’s a movie that, at first glance is unpleasant to look at because of the muted colors and the fiflthy and uncivilized scenes of mudsex and eating maggots but you come to find beauty in these things that are natural just as Reva and Vore find beauty in eachother and being close to nature. Beware the troll penis.
Knowledge is liberation and understanding the self has value. Border is about Tina, a woman who is different in more ways than one, discovering who she is and allowing herself to see that her difference isn't "ugly". Under the genre of romance. fantasy and horror the exploration of the self is twisted in a way that I have never seen before. My heart ached for Tina along the blue tones visuals and the dark narrative that keeps digging.
Strong start, then it shoots itself in the foot and you kind of watch it bleed out for the last half hour. A very ALMOST experience.
From the hilarious reviews here, this is obviously freaking people out. Needless to say, highly recommended. Just look at the gorgeous trailer.
I had no idea what this movie was going to be about.  I freaking loved it.   Constantly surprised by this small little movie about love and identity - reimagining what a fairy tale would be like today.
Some kinda cool, affirmation of monstrous bodies. Too long though, makes its point and keeps making it instead of moving forward, not visually or tonally interesting enough to make that worthwhile
Pretty damn strange. It’s like if someone took Twilight and made it ugly and more narratively interesting. It’s pretty slow though and ultimately leaves you wanting something more.
A Swedish arthouse version of the X-Men.
Well. That was extremely upsetting
Well, that was quite something. Felt that the thriller subplot was a bit unnecessary, but the main plot was well done and quite moving. Also, some of the scenes in this are amongst the weirdest stuff I've seen this year in film.
Not to sound like Jeff Wells but I found everyone and everything in this repulsive and had to fight the urge to flee the theater half a dozen times during the film. Melander and Milonoff are, of course, buried under Cro-Magnon-esque prosthetics and like the characters in LET THE ONE RIGHT IN (which, like this film, is based on the writing of John Ajvide Lindqvist) we’re meant to overlook the character’s more grotesque personal habits and Cronenbergian physiology and recognize their "inner beauty." And if my only objection was being grossed out by the two doughy actors cavorting through the woods like a couple of slope-browed, naked hobbits then you’d be right to mock me for being shallow. But the burgeoning romance between outsiders runs parallel to an astonishingly ill-advised and legally dubious* police procedural b-story that centers around literal infant rape that ultimately dovetails with our two lovers in a way that made me want to take a shower. The message of this film amounts to you can’t judge a book by its cover… except when you can and totally should. *I don’t know how the law works exactly in Sweden but I’m guessing evidence taken from a potential crime scene, secured without a warrant, because an immigration officer has the ability to “smell guilt” wouldn’t hold up in court.
Yorgos Lanthimos meets David Cronenberg in this mind bending debut feature from Sweden, which also happens to be Sweden’s official Oscar entry. @BorderMovie shocks you in the most surreal and elegant manner possible. Review: goo.gl/Dt9MCn  (64rd 🎥/2018) #MAMI2018
One of the most awkward, but well done movies I’ve seen all year. I wish this got a bigger theater release.
Incredible well made. BUT SHOULD IT HAVE BEEN MADE??? I really can’t decide.
I walked out of this screening saying “I could rant why this doesn’t work, but it’s not worth my energy.”  Border is a film that works on paper, and has one of the most intriguing opening 20 minutes I’ve ever seen. From there, it decided to be [at least] three different movies. In the proces, it completely dropsthe more interesting subtexts it originally established in favor of some pretty  distasteful elements. Once this happened, I found myself bored. While I wouldn’t say I was ever annoyed enough to walk out of the theater, I did space out,l. When I tuned back in, I think, “Oh god I missed so much!” before spacing out again five minutes later. The midpoint is genuinely weird – but maybe only weird for the sake of being weird – and kept me on the edge of my seat, although not in a good way. I did hope after that that things would start to click, but soon enough I was bored again.  The lead here is stellar, but most of the other performances were subpar, or the character was too obtuse for me to ever get them. While there was never anything wrong on a technical level, it also wasn’t ever interesting. This is a subpar movie that I wish I hadn’t paid to see. If I had streamed it, I would’ve been happier. While it works on paper, it’s ultimately too messy to ever live up to it’s marketed expectations.
I may be a bit overly subjective here, but personally I didn’t enjoy it much and also genuinely didn’t think its impact justified the film. The film relies on the fact that you are with it, and I was not. Possibly my fault, but especially on films where I go in clean I feel like it’s not my responsibility to work to care. The film should make me care (and most do).   The film really alienated me before it got where it was going emotionally. I was intrigued by a sense of mystery, but then the answer to that mystery (slight spoiler) was something that was basically a sort of deus ex machina. It was so grounded in reality, then decided to be entirely fantasy. I found it really alienating after learning to be with these characters in a realistic setting.  As for its message, it just wasn’t anything we haven’t seen a million times before. Honestly. And I was so pulled out of the film by it subverting expectations so suddenly that I didn’t feel like it earned the grand reckoning that we are meant to feel for the character. It also felt like the second half, where all of this happened, was much more rushed than the first half. It made it really hard to feel for the character when I was still trying to feel for myself.  But I loved the prosthetics and visual effects. It looked really great. And to be both clear and fair, I can see the draw of this film. It just wasn’t for me- I never got the sense of beauty in the story that I was expected to get and that turned me off to it.  I watched this at the IFC Center, which I’m convinced has the best popcorn in the city.
I understand why this is getting the attention it is but I don't know I kept hoping for any of it to matter. Hard to thread social realism, crime thriller, and mythic fairytale into a coherent film but it sure gives it a shot. The awakening-identity sequence was lovely though.
I've never been to Sweden and I haven't seen THAT many Swedish movies and this movie is nigh-impossible to classify AND YET this feels... extremely Swedish.
Eva Melander’s incredible transformation and Oscar-caliber performance is worth your price of admission. Absolutely stunning.
Gorgeous scandithriller fairytale
Hi yes ok um what the fuck! I need somebody else to watch this ASAP just to make sure that I didn’t fall asleep in the theater before the movie started and this wasn’t a 2 hour fever dream I had! Which, strangely enough, this did not feel like it was almost 2 hours. I checked my phone once to see the time, thinking there was like an hour left, and I had only 10 mins of the movie left. It felt like some weird Ang™ time warp in theater 5.  All that being said tho, I didn’t hate this movie? It freaked my shit and I kinda liked it?
I thought this was utterly fascinating, never quite knowing where it was leading but enthralled all the same. Your mileage may vary regarding whether some of this is in "bad taste" or merely a freak show to giggle at uncomfortably but I found it remarkably empathetic to Tina's plight. The central metaphor is loose enough that you could tie it to pretty much anything you might want but I personally found the film to be most rewarding when viewed through the lens of a particularly feminine anger, at the constraints the world places on women, the bliss that can be found in breaking free, and the disappointment and rage that can come with discovering freedom often comes at a price. I don't think this one will be easy to shake.
A bit of a slow burn, but fantastically unique and interesting. Primal and raw, emotionally and physically. Very human and intimate
And the award for weirdest sex scene goes to...
A grotesque fairytale that does achieve a certain weird power, but it wallows in gross-out detail, over-complicates the plot, and doesn't know if it wants to be about empowerment or making a choice. Not what I expected, knowing nothing of the plot - given the title, and an Iranian-Swedish director, I thought it was going to be about migrants (maybe it is? it'd be pretty ballsy, viewed as politically-incorrect metaphor about Islamism as a Muslim's 'true nature') - not what I really wanted either.
One of the most uncomfortable, cringe-worthy experiences I've ever had in a theater. People got up and walked out on more than one occasion in reaction to certain scenes; so forewarning that this is not for those with weak stomachs. That being said, it touches on themes of belonging, professional duty, and even human sanctity itself in ways that I've never seen broached before - and that earns some genuine originality points from me. I will never watch this movie again, but I'm reluctantly glad that I experienced it (and crucially with no prior knowledge of how it would unfold) the one time. C+
Themes of alienation, cruelty and grotesqueness are depicted and explored in an original and fairly abstract form. Despite the unreal setting, the movie draws you in completely. It gives a lot more food for thought, than would be expected if only presented with the premise and outline.
I GOT THIS FEELIN, INSIDE MY BONES
If I had a tail, I’d tell it just the same.
wow. this one needs some time to digest. Beautifully told story. Acting, writing, directing all top notch. Some disturbing moments that work well in the movie as it unravels.
This was really hard to watch. Normally random foreign indie movies are my jam, but this just made me so uncomfy. Best makeup and costumes maybe?
This movie is so weird and so interesting and I can’t stop thinking about it. Incredible make up work, too.
Nordic fantasy Smells like something isn't quite right Finding yourself, here
Shattuck Cinemas I was honestly expecting something a little less conventional, in terms of plot / film style / attempts at characterization. Half of it is a police procedural!?
They announced a Shrek reboot today and, even though this movie is about trolls, I fully expect the Shrek reboot to look like this.
Fascinating in its subversion of typical genre tropes, 'Border' is strange in the best possible way. I think the movie looses some steam towards the end when it takes a bit of a predictable path, but even then, the story beats are well established and set-up so I can't really complain; in the movie's defense, this predictability isn't treated as if it's the greatest surprise in the world or played over-dramatically. Like the rest of the film, it's handled with humanity and emotion. I don't know if the movie completely succeeds, but it's a rare film that I legitimately had no clue where it could go for most of the runtime. I don't want to say anything about it, but man, the whole audience at my showing was wide-eyed and silent and sat through a good chunk of the credits before standing up-- it's that sort of movie.
[A] grim fairy tale set in the modern day. Tina (Eva Melander) is a Swedish customs agent who can smell “shame, fear and guilt” on passengers as they disembark from the ferry. Not a typical skill, but Tina is not your typical anything — her physical appearance is your first clue. ... Border explores some very dark corners, but it explores these boundaries with an assured hand and captivating storytelling. Boulder Weekly
One of the most interesting and original movies I’ve seen in a very long time. Beautiful and deep. Went into this without knowing anything and loved it, one of 2018’s best.
