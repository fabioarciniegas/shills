Really cool how this came out shortly after the war ended, bold move by Kubrick tbh.
Powerful.¬† Fuck the every war and the Vietnam war and fuck every U.S. president ever.
This is one of those movies that falls victim to its structure. Act 1 is sensational, a mini movie on its own. But once you get the conclusion and the second 1/3rd begins, it's almost like you're watching the beginning of a sequel and it makes that entire portion of the movie DRAG But having said that, the last third of the movie is amazing. It really felt like a war setting and the message at the end is very true. Shooting a gun whilst at war and killing someone defenseless at war are two totally different things. 8.4/10
It's pretty good.
Though the first half of this war film is great thanks to superb acting, noteworthy themes and a strong focus on characters however the really great first half is unfortunately let down by the second half as it is a lot messier and divulges into typical Vietnam war cliches while not even really have solid action scenes to make up for them. Nonetheless the film is still engrossing throughout, the cinematography is really good and the score/soundtrack is decent.
Is every Kubrick film an adaptation P.S. ¬†No better way to end it than with the stones
Yet another masterpiece from Stanley Kubrick.
One of my favorite war genres putting it on my 2nd favorite Stanley Kubrick films (besides 2001 of course) a bit slow but that‚Äôs all, decent acting and satisfactory direction and great writing.
Rewatched as part of the Moviedrone podcast after giving it to my co-host in our Homework section. Truly stunning with an amazing score and only Kubrick could add comedic moments in amongst the terrors of war. 85/100
testimonials of what happened in vietnam and the horrifying realization of what happens in army training i very much recommend this
Brutal events and beautiful cinematography coalesce into a singular idea. I think he was trying to say something about the duality of man.
Between the ages of 13 and 15 I watched this every weekend without fail. This is the first time I've seen it since then. Before I was like "haha Hartman calls them gay and hits them!", now to these old eyes it is utterly horrible. The 2nd half is much better than I remember. The sniper, despite being her only acting role, gives a completely chilling performance. Stunning.
this film is just incredible. it tells a story about humans turning into beasts, about men failing in holding their morals up right and about how a war can fuck up one's mind. this film also has a phenominal cinematography (especially some long 'oners' following the soldier from behind in the second half of the film are extremly nice to watch) and pretty good acting.
Just what exactly has to happen to a person that makes them become a drill sgt?¬† Sgt Hartman does possess some devastating one-liners though - if only he was just a little more angry he could‚Äôve been a standup comedian. Imagine what he‚Äôd be like at home with his wife... ‚ÄúLet me see you put some suds on those plates honey! If you don‚Äôt get them spotlessly clean I‚Äôll pull off your ears and piss through your head!‚Äù Or even, ‚ÄúWhen I count three, the blow-jobbing shall begin. Grip that thing correctly now! You will perform this act all night if we have to!‚Äù
I'm sick and bored so gonna rattle off a couple movies I watched on the plane and at home while sick and bored: Every American in this movie is a piece of shit. I fully agree with that sentiment.
Insightful. The vietnam war truly sucked ü§¶üèø‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
I was not high when I watched this movie.
I don‚Äôt love war films but it‚Äôs Kubrick so yeah it‚Äôs great
This is such a depressing yet funny movie. A movie only made by Kubrick could make me feel like this. It slowly escalates towards a more depressing nature and it's one of the best movies that show how war changes a person's mind and twists it. I feel like Kubrick often made movies about how humanity sucks and this is just one of them. It shows how pointless things are sometimes and how death is meaningless, but it's funny how it ends on a happier note. I love this movie and I would write something longer and more in depth, but I gotta watch Under the Silver Lake rn and take away Andrew Garfield's money.
- confession time i suppose: this has never been anywhere near my favorite Kubrick film. i always liked it, i thought it was good, and i've grown to think it's doing a lot of interesting things thematically. but it just had never really resonated enough to place it in personal canon territory. even so, this is probably the kubrick film i've seen the most, for various contextual reasons. - i have to say, watching it now for my 5th or 6th viewing, my feelings on it still mostly hold... for all but one portion of the film. and that's the ending sniper scene. i've now grown to consider it one of the most otherworldly stretches in Kubrick's oeuvre, rivaling some of the best scenes in 2001 or Barry Lyndon. this scene alone justifies claiming the 2nd half as blowing the much lauded 1st half out of the water as far as i'm concerned. - i also feel like this is one of the few Vietnam war films that completely and unambiguously portrays the U.S. military and its participation in that event as an absurd atrocity while managing to do so in an extremely well measured (tonally speaking) way. i do appreciate it quite a bit for that.
Kubrick continues his winning streak with this work of art. Full Metal Jacket is a pretty unique war movie. It‚Äôs unpredictable, features a great script and has Stanley Kubrick‚Äôs directing, so what more could you ask for?
'Full Metal Jacket' is an interesting film as Kubrick never really made anything else that featured such an incredible change in tone midway through the film. Most, myself included, prefer the first half focusing on boot camp as opposed to the second half war, but that's not to shine a negative light on the latter. The complete film is intense, tight, and comedic at times. While it may not be the most original film Kubrick made, or unique from a war-film perspective, what 'Full Metal Jacket' does better than its contemporaries is effectively communicate its message and themes.
I originally saw this a long time ago when it first came out on VHS. I didn‚Äôt really care for it all that much. In fact, it wasn‚Äôt really all that memorable. Two years ago, I saw the DVD at a flea market for a dollar so, since it‚Äôs Kubrick, I thought maybe I should give it a second chance. So, I popped the disk in the tray and the first thing I noticed is that the film isn‚Äôt in the letterbox format which is a bit of a bummer but there‚Äôs not much I can do about that. Anyway, I think I was right the first time. This just isn‚Äôt my kinda film. It‚Äôs so grim and never really comes together as a comprehensive whole. In fact, it just leaves you feelin‚Äô kinda shitty when it‚Äôs done. I guess that shouldn‚Äôt be too surprising for a war film but who wants to feel like they‚Äôve been kicked in the junk after a two-hour sit-down? Nevertheless, there are some good moments here so it wasn‚Äôt a total waste of time. I give this a 6 outta 10 and although I own it, I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll be watching it again.
A painfully visceral 2 hours of essential viewing
kinda disappointed in that one. I mean it's an excellent movie and when it first came out it probably was revolutionary to some people but watching this one after watching other "war" movies feels weird....idk but maybe the message isn't THAT deep...war is complex, killing people is hard, what does a soldier fights for? kills for? is this necessary? are we the bad guys or the good guys? It definitely involves all these questions but isn't transcendent to me...Plus, I don't get why switching the movie so hard after the first part...Anyway, it's still very good and important but I whish it had a smarter plot (but I understand this version tho) :)
Blu ray watch¬† Still a bit disappointed
Kubrick shows with this film why he is one of the most renowned directors of all time. Due to the breath-holding suspense and the phenomenal acting, this movie does not let you go.
‚ÄúSeven-six-two millimeter. Full metal jacket.‚Äù PREVIOUS REVIEW I explained the premise and said a couple of quotes to my dad and he said it sounded really good so we watched it together, hence the extremely short breaks between rewatched. He loved it and gave it a 9/10.¬† Hot Take: The second half of this film is just as good as the first, it‚Äôs more rich thematically, just as funny, harrowing and entertaining and just as well made.¬† This is still one of the finest character studies, it has impeccable direction, phenomenal performances, a masterful script, with great editing.¬† Fun Fact: Vincent D'Onofrio gained 70 pounds for his role as Pvt. Pyle, breaking Robert De Niro's movie weight-gain record for Raging Bull. It took him seven months to put the weight on and nine months to take it off with physical training. 98/100 Would Recommend!
When a 31 year old film set during the Vietnam war feels just as relevant today by masterfully showing how young recruits are dehumanized into effective soldiers, and is made possible by iconic performances by R. Lee Ermey and Vincent D'Onofrio and the direction and vision of Stanley Kubrick. I talk more about Full Metal Jacket in episode 50 of the Red 7 Movie Cast podcast. Listen and subscribe here: www.redsevencast.com/2018/11/20/episode-50-blackkklansman-full-metal-jacket/
Cold, pretentious, and ultimately pointless, it has some fun moments, but mostly it just meanders and annoys. Kubrick's vison of Vietnam is overblown, and self important.
The cold, detached stillness hangs heavily.
A truly truly fucked up movie. Used to be my fav Kubrick flick but I think the shining holds the throne for me these days.
Stress-watch
When you're in the armed forces, it's not FMJ, it's FML.
I don't know what's up with me and war movies recently, but I'm loving it. No contest with Patton though, this is a new level of filmmaking. It also sports the absolute coolest title drop. One of the most terrifying shots ever closes the first part, and it's gonna haunt me forever. Love the mirroring shots before and after the first battle. In fact, the abundance of horizontal tracking shots i welcome, because they're all awesome. There is a SMILE at the end of the second battle and it's the best thing in the movie!! Every scene is so... layered? Like, each shot is so deep, but somehow looks flat. It's incredible.
Would be a 5/5 if it were just Ermey and D'Onofrio tho
‚ÄúKiss me goodbye and write me while I'm gone Goodbye my sweetheart, Hello Vietnam.‚Äù The Good: On the surface Full Metal Jacket is an incredibly entertaining war film, but when you dig deeper there are layers of subtext that add whole new layers to the film. It‚Äôs really about the limits of a person ‚Äúthe duality of man‚Äù, loss of innocence and authoritarianism amongst so many other things. The most compelling aspect of the film was the toll that constant pressure and the promise of combat had on Private Pyle. The script is also extremely tight and has wonderful dialogue with a very solid narrative. Full Metal Jacket is one of the most masterfully crafted films ever. Stanley Kubrick is in complete control as per usual, the fluid and seamless camerawork was stunning and sweeping. Kubrick sets up the comedic tone with dark undertones that works well for the most part. The film while funny delivers some of the most tense segments in film history that have me holding my breath on the third watch. Full Metal Jacket is filled with excellent performances. Vincent D‚ÄôOnofrio is as intimidating as he is hilarious. Each character had wonderful chemistry and identity due in part to the script, but mostly it‚Äôs the fantastic performances. The Bad: I have issues with some very minor performances that feel very out of place. I also felt there were a few moments were a humor felt very out of place and unnecessary.¬† Fun Fact: In the first part of the movie, in the sequences inside the barracks during the drill, a special lens was designed to keep every single Recruit in focus. Director Stanley Kubrick intended that no one was special and they all had the same treatment. 98/100 Would Recommend!
2 day rewatch I used to think this was a weaker Kubrick. What a fuckin fool I was!
It seems like most things to be said about this have been said. The first half is a masterpiece. The second half pales in comparison a little bit but is still amazing. Vincent D‚ÄôOnofrio and R. Lee Ermey are perfect in their roles. Every other great thing you get from Kubrick you get here.¬† However, there are two things I haven‚Äôt seen anybody say: 1) I love how everything in this is a little off. A little off center. A little diagonal. The camera is a little crooked. It really makes for an unsettling feeling throughout the film.¬† 2) I gotta give props on a film in the Vietnam War for not having Fortunate Son Strong 8
Once upon a time, I went with my parents to their work convention (that year it was in the ungodly location of St. Johns, Newfoundland - no joke) and spent a lot of time chilling in the hotel room. FULL METAL JACKET had recently come out, and was the featured selection on the pay-per-view channel. I watched the trailer for it a gazillion times, and even watched part of it scrambled (this was the 80s after all) so I could hear, not see it. Later, when I purchased the VHS and finally got to see it, I couldn't get enough of the early training sequences with Lee Ermey, but then sort of tuned out once the picture moves to Vietnam. Vietnam in FULL METAL JACKET looks nothing like the Vietnam in any of the other 'Nam pics like THE DEER HUNTER or PLATOON. Many veterans are quick to point out that fact as well, and a book about Vietnam films spends a chapter slamming this one because of that. But the barren, surreal look of the FULL METAL JACKET vision of Vietnam adds to it's mystery. It almost looks like it's on another planet. None of the helicopters used look like the ones from archival footage, and the lighting is strange and ethereal, especially in the final sequence where the platoon takes on a sniper. The real crux of the picture though are those scenes in training camp with Ermey completely stripping these men down of their ego and all the baggage they come in with, and sending them out the door as trained killers, courtesy of the of United States Marine Corp. He's so good at his job in fact, that his constant degradation and humiliation of the simple Gomer Pyle (Vincent D'Onofrio) gets the desired effect and then some. I have usually considered FULL METAL JACKET (along with EYES WIDE SHUT) to be among Kubrick's weaker films. JACKET has grown on me over the years, and this viewing is thanks to seeing FILMWORKER and in which this picture plays a big part in the narrative. I am going to dive into the commentary which features D'Onofrio and Ermey because that is one set I would have loved to been on, standing off to the side and seeing this chaos unfold. There is no way either of those two were not scarred during those moments. D'Onofrio is stronger than Modine even, whose character really doesn't do all that much outside of observing. But now, more than ever, the picture no longer grinds to a halt once the picture exits basic training.
On second watch I have a new appreciation for "Full Metal Jacket". I still prefer the first part, I think is fascinating how the minds of the soldiers are slowly shaped in order to "reborn" as a killing machines. But now I liked a second part a lot more. The normalization of violence and the manipulation of the media was a lot more apparent on this watch, making this half feel like the aftermath of the first, which I didn't quite like on my original watch. Its not one of my favorites of Kubrick, but its certainly a different way to view the war and I can only appreciate that.
ME SO HORNY. Leads us and a battalion of grunts through their boot camp and onwards to them serving in the Vietnam War, there‚Äôs lots of different ailments during war. We explore them. It‚Äôs a film of two halves, literally. There‚Äôs quite a big contrast to me, not in terms of quality, but content. Although, the first half is much better, because it explores a different aspect of war. R. Lee Ermey and Vincent D‚ÄôOnofrio are both fantastic in completely different ways and a lot of the time they both make you feel really uncomfortable, like the situation itself. It really focuses on the psychological tolls of war, and of people. It‚Äôs not only the enemy that can kill you, and it‚Äôs not only the enemy that‚Äôs killing Americans in this specific context. The second half of the film goes for a more traditional side of a war film, although it still does do it a little differently. It‚Äôs very comedic, doesn‚Äôt show too much gunplay and always tries to give us this conflicting feeling that some of the characters are fully open to and even almost happy about what they‚Äôre doing, but others are more prone to question what‚Äôs actually going on. It adds a human realism to the situation for me, and I appreciate the fact. Obviously from a film making point of view it‚Äôs next to flawless, but that doesn‚Äôt take away from one half being much better than the other for me. Also, does anyone else get really uncomfortable listening to these ‚Äúkilling machines‚Äù singing these upbeat songs together? It‚Äôs very macabre. I think it represents the tone of this film perfectly. I‚Äôm not a war guy, or a war film guy. This was great, but the quality of each half is a bit too mixed to award it any higher. Still, the first half is brilliant. 4.
The first 45 minutes were easily the best parts imo
I recently watched this again. Holy wow it‚Äôs good even though it was made a long time ago. Classic
R Lee Ermey's insults are both hilarious and terrifying at the same time also I'm pretty sure this film hands down has the best soundtrack ever.
the first half of the film???? maybe stanley kubrick does matter
Vincent D'Onofrio is a god. See also: Jarhead
The first 45 minutes is pure gold, the rest is also really good, however nothing beats the drill instructor!
Stan Lee Cool Brick
This is my riffle This is my Gun!
I got to the first thirty minutes and I felt as if I had spent years with these characters. This film is one of the most heart reaching and disturbing films I have seen.
Stanley sat grinning at his type writer: me so horny...me love you... long time...genius.
When I end up having the same problems with the majority of war films, I find it remarkable that this avoids them all. With a beautiful balance, deeply personal story-telling and moments of profound moral enquiry, Kubrick has created the most honest and utterly compelling piece of war fiction of the 80s.
I will continue to ponder on how the first and second half of the film is connected, but for now I will admire the cinematography (competent tracking shots with the drill sergeant in the center of the frame and handheld chaos in the middle of battle), the duality of man (not only the helmet and peace symbol, but the contrasting tones of humor and death), and the heartbreaking depiction of war (that final shot will stick with me for quite some time).
Sporting a suspenseful, thrilling first act that is only hampered in its awe by the succeeding events in Vietnam (save for the final scenes), this is easily the weakest Kubrick film I have seen thus far (and I've seen many). Where the psychological destruction of Pvt. Pyle draws the audience's attention significantly, the occurrences in the war itself seem comparatively dull and average at best. What's more, R. Lee Ermey's performance as the drill instructor supersedes that of anyone in his destructive path, making for character interactions that drive conflict and character development far more so than any lingering piece of...whatever in the second act. The film may have benefitted from being exclusively relegated to the training grounds and expanding the narrative of the first half such that those events would encompass the entire film. There are plenty of other, better stories from Vietnam told in motion pictures (such as Casualties of War), and this isn't one of them.
I love this film, don‚Äôt get me wrong, Stanley Kubrick is spectacular.¬† However.¬† It felt to me like the first half of film and th second half of the film felt like two separate shorter films. The first being about a training process following the story of a young trainee army member with a brutal leader leading to his eventual suicide. And the second: a story in Vietnam of how a journalist views the war scenes and captures the moments that effect the lives of everyone.¬† They just don‚Äôt link... However (again).¬† I love both parts so so so SO much that I still am rating the film 4.5*s and anyone who follows me is aware I rarely review a film at 5*s. Perhaps Kubrick intended to do this, or perhaps he thought they linked. After all films have many interpretations and readings that I could just have a niche view ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
Not my usual type of movie. To be honest I didn't think I was ever going to watch this movie, but the night my brother and I came home from work my dad was watching it and we both just kinda...sat down and watched it with him because why not! We had a cute lil family night and he restarted the movie for us so that we could understand what was happening, and it was pretty darn good. It's not my kind of movie but I can understand why people would like it. That's about all I have to say. The first part was. Very intense. The whole movie is intense really.
Genius! It's not a dramatic war story, but it really moves you...
I'm not a fan of war, but Vietnam has always fascinated me. Full metal jacket is one of the best depictions of the Vietnam war I've ever seen, its going after cacciato meets a clockwork Orange. Utterly beautiful and psychologically thrilling film.
Maybe worth 5. The apparent lack of continuity in the second half takes away from it a bit but it more or less works to demonstrate Jokers shift from a recruit to a killer.
I don't care what anyone says I think the second half is as great as the first half.
R. Lee Ermey makes a good war movie absolutely great. During the first half of the movie while the grunts are in training, Ermey gives one of the greatest performances by an actor in a war/military movie in all of movie history. The combat scenes are good but Ermey takes the movie to a whole new level. It comes across as comical, funny as hell, even if that's not what the filmmaker intended. Those sensitive to graphic language and gritty combat scenes will likely not enjoy the movie, but for the rest of us, this is a spectacularly good war movie and one that all fans of the genre should rank near the top of their lists.
Kubrick always has something to say and he says it loud and clear in this one. He balances the content of satirical humor and terrifying conditions very well here and it makes you laugh uneasily. And I think it is way more effective because of just that. It has some fantastic performances here as well, specifically from Matthew Modine and R. Lee Ermey. A good watch. I'd recommend it.
I don't like war movies and I seem to not like Kubrick's films. I don't see why this has an average 4 star rating? The film has not clear storyline, no comprehensive plot? I was bored to death in the first 30minutes and while it got a bit better, the plot was nothing you could feel with incredibly overrated
Really good movie. Watched it for class and it was interesting.
All war movies suck, this one the least
Full¬†Metal Jacket is considered a classic and a masterpiece... I get that it's Stanley Kubrick but I feel like The Shining, A Clockwork Orange are better and way stronger and have more Kubrick's style all over those movies I just mentioned. Full Metal Jacket is have a strong first half and 2nd half but goes downhill for me near 3rd act gets little boring and slow I understand why they did it but I got little bored it feels like a different type of film in the 3rd act and also I did not know Vincent D'onofrio was in this film in till I look it up after finished this film the character he plays was unpredictable and kind of cool I guess he become Bug in Men in Black and Kingpin in Daredevil after something happens to his character... (Bad joke I know) That FUCKING BIRD IS THE WORD... Thanks Family Guy for making that¬†song so annoying.. All jokes aside Full Metal Jacket is fun but not perfect and R. Lee Ermey was a lot of fun as well he has lot over the top comments what he says to other soldiers! I did like this movie I would see it again but not for a while it's a decent flick!
It's so good I won't even compare the first 40 minutes to the next hour and 10 mins
I've seen this before but it still remains my personal favourite of Kubrick's. It's a savage depiction of war and the story is told brilliantly through the eyes of Private "Joker" (Matthew Modine). Modine is excellent as Joker, especially in the latter half as we see him dealing with the emotional consequences of the war. R. Lee Ermey is also memorable as the profane and abusive Gunnery Sergeant Hartman. Vincent D'Onofrio also deserves a mention for his astonishing performance as Leonard "Gomer Pyle" Lawrence. The cinematography is stunning with great use of long takes and extreme close-ups to build tension.
The deterioration of civilization and dehumanization of the characters can be seen as Joker comes closer and closer to the realities of war. We see this when Pyle‚Äôs psyche falls apart and he kills the instructor, the loss of structure in the group as Animal Mother and Cowboy argue over leadership, Rafterman‚Äôs laugh of hysteria after shooting down the teenage sniper. And ultimately, Joker gives the camera his thousand yard stare after killing the girl, showing that, like the rest of the group, he too has become demoralized by the war.
Man what a ride. The disorientation and insanity of the Vietnam War really shines through with some really great visual storytelling. If I had to quibble with it, the first half an hour completely eclipses the rest of the movie. Yet, having put this movie off for far too long, its gory conclusion was as disturbing as it was memorable.
Full Metal Jacket is the movie that made it possible for Vincent D‚ÄôOnofrio. To become one of our most reliable character actor.
An incredible film. Two different films in terms of story, the first half and the second half. Connected by the characters and how they shift and navigate this world. The whole film seems to be like this hellish dream world. We know this by the end of the first half and the end of the second half. It‚Äôs an incredible war film like I‚Äôve never seen before.
There‚Äôs a reason why this is in my top four favorite films I‚Äôve ever seen. It‚Äôs a powerful and affecting tour de force. What‚Äôs awesome about this film is how unlike many other war films, it doesn‚Äôt ever feel like a chore to watch.¬† It‚Äôs always disappointing when you realize D‚ÄôOnofrio has barely showcased his talent in the most recent films he‚Äôs done. He‚Äôs now almost an annoying actor to watch, which is unfortunate given how much he is capable of.
Great cinematography but I think the whole "war is bad and we probably shouldn't do it" message is a bit stale and obvious now. The first half was better and should have just been the whole thing.
Kubrick excels in his use of appropriate music to improve a scene, better than Quentin Tarantino even. The confusion of war is well described in this thought-provoking film and the PT scenes were stellar in their attempts to describe the initiation that all military personnel go through. R. Lee Ermey steals the show and lifts it to a higher art form. A must-see for any war movie enthusiast.
94 "I am in a world full of shit, yes. But I am alive. And I'm not afraid." The first act of this film never ceases to leave me speechless, no matter how many times I watch it. Hell, dare I say it has the best first act of any film ever. The whole training camp sequence is nothing short of genius writing and execution on Kubrick's part, at first glance seemingly unnecessary, but the more you look into it the more vital it becomes. The actual war part, while not as eviscerating and enthralling as the amazing training camp act, is pure war action--painful and unbearably frustrating.
love the use of the kubrick-zoom‚Ñ¢Ô∏è
at first I thought this was gonna be comedy, but damn I was wrong
...no soul brother, too big...
Amazing first half, brilliant direction by Kubrick leads to a tense dehumanising atmosphere making it so the audience feels the gradual loss of humanity for the characters. Massive drop off however about an hour in after what should have clearly been the climax of the film
With the character names you‚Äôve got to think Kubrick was lining himself up to direct the Justice League - Joker, Animal Mother, Eightball, Rafterman, Cowboy, Touchdown, Payback, Crazy Earl. It's like he was made to make an ensemble super hero film.
Duality
Best Vietnam War movie, I stake my reputation on it.¬† Maybe not, but like, I wanted to write something dramatic. Sue me.
Urm idk if this is it Chief. Interesting commentary on the excessive violence of war but i didnt necessarily feel anything for any of the characters. I know Leonard was meant to be the first casualty of the war but the last half of the film felt very disjointed from its beginning to me. Also I see you Damien Chazelle taking inspiration for Terrence Fletcher I see you. My first Kubrick.
70 Watched: once
It's Kubrick, that's about all I need to say.
Does for the Mickey Mouse song what A Clockwork Orange does for Singin' in the Rain.
"Meesa horny."  Any film with this as a line of dialogue should instantly set off alarm bells. But thankfully Full Metal Jacket doesn't go down the same route as a certain other 3 parter. This is a film very clearly made up of 3 acts, or chapters in Joker's journey as a marine; boot camp, life in Vietnam, and all out war. In each the soldier ideology is studied with a different setting and tone. There are a lot of parallels to The Shining to be found, though where that film covers mental deterioration over a short period of time, FMJ takes a longer and more grounded look specifically at the dehumanisation of soldiers.  "If you ladies leave my island, if you survive recruit training, you will be a weapon. You will be a minister of death praying for war. But until that day, you are pukes. You are the lowest form of life on Earth. You are not even human fucking beings."  Joker is the epitome of character progression within a story. As a rookie he must learn to become a cold blooded killer, but not a machine. He can kill all he wants, so long as he keeps his humanity.  "The Marine Corps does not want robots."  In that way the system is full of contradictions. We see more of these when Hartman promotes Joker for his individuality, mistaking it for steadfastness. Instead of stomping it out of him, he lets it fester, encourages it even. This contradiction goes against what a certain recruit and thereby the audience have been fed into believing: there are consequences if you struggle to --or can't-- adapt.  "God has a hard-on for Marines because we kill everything we see! He plays His games, we play ours!"  When Joker is shipped to Vietnam, he's lucky enough to not be involved in any combat, only reporting on it. Through his optimistic outlook, unchanged sense of humour, subtleties in body language and wearing a peace badge, Joker has clearly been sheltered up to this point. He has not committed himself to the war so is passively against it. When a marine from the deep end boasts of counting women and children as confirmed kills, Joker is sickened. But as events transpire and he falls deeper into the thick of it, Joker becomes exactly what horrified him in the first place. His peace badge becomes less and less visible, until, at the crux, it is totally obscured by his jacket collar.  I realise I have just rambled on about a new favourite of mine, but I honestly don't know how else I could do it justice. There's a lot more to talk about here, but I think it's far stronger experienced first hand. Once you've watched it it's really worth looking into, e.g. I didn't even touch on the soundly developed theme of losing innocence, or even Pyle. With so many collaborators in the making of this, Full Metal Jacket proves Stanley Kubrick's mastery of getting exactly what he wants. I'll need to watch it once more before I decide if I can give it 5 stars, but either way it's my favourite Kubrick.
Kubrick's most quotable Film. R Lee Ermey is otherworldly. The 2nd half is just as good if not better than the 1st. The Finale is one of the GOAT ones.
I watched this in my school's computer lab when I was 16 and a buddy looked at me with confusion cause he saw I was watching this and asked me "is it any good?" and I answered yes. This is a good movie.
Half of the part is always making me laugh, then the other half is suddenly turn into serious one.
Private Pyle lacks the human mannerisms to disguise his inner unconscious (smiling at Hartman's monologue), and therefore is victimized by Hartman and reprogrammed the harshest Pyle and his gun "Charlene" fulfill Hartman's wishes to reprogram sexuality/morality in Marines -"climax of blood and brain over the white antiseptic surface of Hartman's utopian dream" Absurd paradox between parts one and two-Hartman's desire to replace sexual libido with fantasies of war and a homoerotic paradise, contrasted with the mens hyper-sexuality in part two Absurdity is placed in the text, not subtext of part two Euphemisms still govern the troops in part two-"Sweep and Clear, not Search and Destroy" Joker acts a satiric/ironic voice in part two, as Vietnam forces him to hide from the psychological and moral truth of it -Mimics Bruce Lee and John Wayne, wears Born To Kill and peace button Joker's journey in pt. 2 reverses Pyle's, as Joker's humanity breaks through his removed satire Bodies covered in white lime in pit contrasted with Pyle's suicide in white latrines-the final tipping point for Pyle and Joker, Pyle to finish his training and Joker to access his humanity
Perhaps it‚Äôs because I‚Äôm not real into war films or because I expect a large amount from Kubrick, but I didn‚Äôt like the film as much as I wanted to. People praise it, but, to me, I only cared about the first 45 minutes and afterwards I checked out. This may be because the structure confuses the messages of the film. I felt that that first half offered an interesting look at the idea that war is hell and how it changes a person. Full Metal Jacket is the movie version of Slaughterhouse Five but I find it hard to glean much more other than what the first half got across. Part of this confusion makes me wonder the origins of the screenplay and concept since it‚Äôs the most outwardly violent and explorative of human nature that Kubrick ever got. Although his other films feature violent characters (Alex, A Clockwork Orange; Johnny, The Shining), this one contains violent surroundings with men that aren‚Äôt all meant to be violent. I just wished there was more going on other than watching men die in battle and then Joker having to make dehumanizing choices.  Also- can we talk about the score? Of all the people, I didn‚Äôt expect a Kubrickian film to use music to set the time frame. It‚Äôs still great, but it‚Äôs odd.
Took me way too long to see this. Outstanding war film. Can never go wrong with Kubrick.
traditional anti-war films start with men before dehumanisation - introducing them full of heart, and then eroding it in combat. full metal jacket reverses this arc. identities are stripped away in the opening, while later we see laughter, comradeship and levity. usually normality is framed as a relief, because no matter how bad war is, humans are good, but kubrick challenges this. humans aren't fundamentally good. we shouldn't breathe easy, because dehumanisation takes seconds. the things we associate with resilience and stoicism become brutal insensibility, which is in itself a horror of war.
It's amazing how despite how much has been based on this it still works and feels powerful and fresh from the opening scene on through. Those first 45 minutes are especially stunning and some of the best I've seen.
If you ever wanna know where most of the earliest references came from..
R. Lee Ermey gives the greatest performance in movie history. The rest of the amazing but he steals the show. Or at least the first half of the show. It is really two films in one. The boot camp first half and the second during the Tet Offensive. Both find a way to be thoroughly entertaining, intense, satirical and somehow funny. Of all the Vietnam movie's of the mid to late 80's this is the best.
Two films in one, Full Metal Jacket must be the definitive war film. Covering the basic training to mission completion, the senseless of the fight, the dehumanising changes to personality, and even the quiet times - the scope of this feature feels epic.
Another perfect film. Kubrick's work is just dripping with meaning and metaphor. There are many reasons why this is my favorite war movie, but I guess, more than anything, it doesn't stay focused on any one theme for too long. A lot of people focus on the first half because of the super dark ending, but some really heavy parts pass by in one or two quick lines like, "How can you shoot woman and children?" and the gunner's response of, "Easy! You just don't lead them so much. War's hell, ain't it?" There are tons of little moments like this that other directors devote entire films to (the sociopolitical impacts of having the press cover the war and the way they do it, how Joker, displaying the duality of man, commits his first kill in an act of mercy, etc.). The more I watch this, I begin to think the second half may actually be the stronger half, especially when comparing to other Vietnam movies like Platoon and Apocalypse Now. This film doesn't overmoralize. There are no simple answers. I think one of the most glaring themes I see every time I watch this is the strength of the team over the individual. As certain people are added or are removed from the collective group, the group survives. The drill instructor basically outright says this at one point, referring to the Marine Corps, and it holds true throughout. It's hard not to see, for example, the parallels in Animal Mother and Private Pyle. The two end up having completely opposite outcomes. It doesn't even really matter the makeup of the group or the words in the marches, just that they do them as a single unit, as seen in the final shot. Perhaps most notably, the actor who plays Joker is also in The Dark Knight Rises?! WHAT ARE THE ODDS?!
The first 45 minutes could stand alone as one of the greatest (short?) films ever made. The last hour plus is well crafted and well acted, but it just doesn't bring anything interesting to the table that we haven't seen time and time again.
‚ÄúThis is my rifle. There are many like it but this one is mine. My rifle is my best friend. It is my life. I must master it as I must master my life. Without me, my rifle is useless. Without my rifle I am useless. I must fire my rifle true. I must shoot straighter than my enemy, who is trying to kill me. I must shoot him before he shoots me. I will. Before God I swear this creed: my rifle and myself are defenders of my country, we are the masters of my enemy, we are the saviors of my life. So be it, until there is no enemy, but peace. Amen.‚Äù
Full Metal Jacket is one of Kubrick's best.
I fell asleep during the 3rd act, that really says something about my opinion on this film. :-/
How many movies should one watch before they finally give up on trying to like Kubrick? To be fair, this was the least bad so far
This film is almost two completely different films; the first half is all about the training side of it and shows more of the psychological side of it all with what the soldiers are thinking and feeling and allows us to delve into the darker depths of their minds. The second half is a pure war film with the characters now in Vietnam and actually experiencing the harsh realities of war and, as well as giving us awesome battle sequences, once again shows us a more psychological side with how the characters can deal with war. The performances in this film are fantastic and realistic; you would almost believe these characters were real people being documented. The cinematography and editing is great as it only adds to the tension of the film. The script is great as well but also the improvised dialogue at the beginning added a touch of realism but also made the film that little bit more frightening and intense. Overall, this is a really great bit of cinema. The first half of this film provides an excellent build-up and the second half is an incredible payoff. Score: 88/100
Contrary to most people, I actually prefer the second half of this movie. While yes, the drill sgt. has great lines, the boot camps scenes are a disturbing look into how they really had to make young men ready to kill. The second half then shows the disturbing, heartbreaking realities of war. This glamorous picture of war is shattered in front of our eyes, and the characters realize, as many real young men did in Vietnam, that war is hell. This may be the film that has emotionally effected me the most.
‚ÄúYou look like the best part of you ran down the crack of your momma‚Äôs ass and ended up as a brown stain on the mattress.‚Äù  A traumatic and brutal look at the dehumanization of soliders from boot camp to the war itself. He covers so much throughout, some may find parts more enthralling then others, but i loved it all in its entirety. Kubrick being a perfectionist makes his films so easy to gaze at even if you aren‚Äôt completely hooked. His visuals are so raw and effective, which make this one of the best looking films I‚Äôve ever seen. His use of wide angles, long takes, and zooms make for some incredible tension. No music adds to that as well. Just smoke and flames, gunshots and bloodshed. R. Lee Ermey gives one of my all time favorite performances here.
this was so perfectly filmed with perfect lighting....perfect camerawork the continuous shots wow
The first half of the movie is such a masterpiece that I feel like it makes the other half of the film mute. The movie feels like a double feature every time I watch it. I by no means think that the second half of the movie is bad. it's actually really good. It's just not the masterpiece of the first half.
Here's my 2000th movie on Letterboxd I'm sure I've seen more than 2,000 movie overall ,i just can't remember them . And yes ,It was what I expected "Dope"
damn this a good movie and its like split into 2 films. The first part of this film is about a retarded guy whos name i cant even remember but he is like a retard in the military (redundant i know) and like i guess the sergeant is a dumb asshole who is trying to make these young men tough. So during america's illegal war in vietnam the US was just sending every young boy across the world to go and die for communism or something and apparently retards were allowed to die for this cause as well (may God have mercy on our souls) and this retard, private pyle is antagonized for about 45 minutes straight by his sergeant. It actually gets boring after 10 minutes but i guess like boomers love it because pussy millennials dont understand heard work or something i dont fucking know anymore tbh. along the way pyle is befriended by this white guy called "Joker" and joker is like an anti war guy or something but like he's cool to private pyle and he helps pyle the best he can i guess. Pyle is bullied by everyone at camp and one night they even beat the shit out of him while he's asleep and im sorry but i laughed when private pyle cried. Anyways pyle is driven to insanity and one night while everyone is asleep, like a dumb asshole he is reciting military war hymns or something and it catches the attention of joker who is on night duty. Pyle is in the bathroom just looking scary as fuck holding a loaded weapon and the sergeant nigga wakes up and asks what is going on but because the sergeant is a stupid fuck he has zero clue how to deescalate the slaughter thats about to happen and he just insults the retarded man with loaded weapon. Pyle shoots the sergeant in the chest and the kills himself and the first half of the film ends. The second part is actually better than the first and it made me want to go beat up chinese (vietnam people) yea so joker is the main character i guess and now hes in vietnam and im actually tired of writing so pretty much theres a few cool characters and the black guy dies but they kill some vietnam girl and its just kinda sad because what was the vietnam war even about? Oil, anime, racism?? who knows my guy. ANyways war is fucked and i dont think anyone really enjoys that shit. I have seen so many people die in front of me and it's just as crazy the 25th time as it was the first.
R. Lee Ermey is always the best thing in ever movie he's in!
Weakest Kubrick I've seen yet, but it's Kubrick, so it's still pretty good. The first half was better and had more character than the Vietnam scenes, which were slow, didn't really go anywhere, but were at least shot really well. Great usage of contemporary music.
duality of man i guess
This is one of my dads faves and we tend to agree on movies however we had vastly different reactions: he could quote every scene from it and enjoyed it since the 80s I flinched at the verbal abuse and the way the Vietnam war affected each of the men In conclusion: war! a mess!
I'm starting to think war is bad, guys.
Hm, yes... the real enemy is toxic masculinity.
People dog on the second half of this movie. Not only is it great, it might be my favorite half of the film.
when stanley kubrick made the best possible use of the handheld / shaky cam i felt that
Kubrick‚Äôs attempt at a war film gives you two films for the price of one. The first hour is an intense and occasionally funny montage of marines in training, culminating in the most disturbing way.¬† The second part is more traditional in bringing you into the fighting. Although this bit doesn‚Äôt quite live up to the first part, Full Metal Jacket is still an interesting take on Vietnam from a refreshing angle. And typically Kubrick.
Let me see you warface!
I finally did it and I‚Äôm starting to see why so many people love Kubrick. Not only is this film a great critique on Toxic Masculinity, Overblown Patriotism and War, it also functions as a Black Comedy.¬† It has excellent performances, especially from R.Lee Ermey and Vincent D‚ÄôOnofrio. It‚Äôs shot spectacularly with great usage of long takes that really make you feel out the environment. And it‚Äôs about 10x better than Apocalypse Now. 1 down many more to go, let‚Äôs see what you‚Äôve got Kubrick.
One of Kubrick's s@#tiest films. Right?
Now this is a really crazy realistic war movie the kind that make you crazy about go to war.
Stanley Kubrick's penultimate film shows him still at the top of his game, with some of the finest cinematography in his oeuvre. Sure, everyone knows the first 45 minutes, with R. Lee Ermey's iconic performance (Improvised, at that! A rarity when it comes to Kubrick's filmography, with only Ermey and Malcolm McDowell in Clockwork being the only exceptions) and Vincent D'Onofrio's memorable nervous breakdown. However, the rest of the film, especially that final firefight, serves as some of Kubrick's more underrated work. The man's a damn genius.
Powerful film!
The older I've gotten the less I like this film, but that bit with the dying guy in the middle of the street is amazing.
the first bit with r lee ermy is the best part of the movie
War is hell and causes trauma to anyone involved, genuinely a great war and psychological piece.
sis the trauma
I wanted to like it more than i did. It's well made, has a good soundtrack and is well shot but i didn't find many of the characters interesting and the ones that were didn't get enough screen time in my opinion. There is however a plenty of things to enjoy about it regardless of it's flaws.
This film was weird to me because I've seen the opening training segment parodied so much in other media that it kinda felt like a comedy, but then that stuff with Vincent D'Onofrio hit me hard, his face was some of the creepiest vibes I've seen in a while. The rest of the film as a Vietnam study touches on some interesting issues around the political themes of the war which a lot of other popular Vietnam films don't explore.

i can‚Äôt help myself from sounding like an asshole! if you‚Äôre opinion of this movie is separating it into two parts one of which is good and one of which is bad you are a LOSER and you don‚Äôt understand how to watch movies! maybe there are no wrong opinions but yours sucks! this is the best war movie i‚Äôve ever seen‚Äîcertainly the funniest.
‚ÄúYou climb like old people fuck, Private Pyle!‚Äù Stanley Kubrick is the üêê, hands down. 95/100
A great film. One of those movies that just pulls emotions out of you without telling you what to feel. It's disturbing, gruesome, powerful, and sad. It tells the true horrors of war and when the men laugh at crude jokes or play with a body, you understand why, because of empathy.
