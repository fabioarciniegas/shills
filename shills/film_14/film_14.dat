Coco has all the elements of a perfect film: humor, heart, telenovela twists and visuals I‚Äôll probably never forget. This incredibly vivacious and touching movie about memory, legacy and family made me cry.
Coco is fun and vibrant and surprisingly dark at times. The visuals are gorgeous, there are some great laughs, and a story about acceptance and forgiveness that delves into some grim territory I was not expecting. Also that dog is silly.
I cried like a baby
I don‚Äôt care if it‚Äôs Disney at its most tear-engineered... I loved everything about this and may never recover.
Exactly what I needed. I know it's old news to say that the animation in this is beautiful, but this time around I was especially struck by the water when Miguel falls into the hole. It's fricking gorgeous.
people who don't like this movie don't deserve rights
Amazing script, gorgeous animation, and great voice acting. Pinnacle of what Pixar is capable of. Please do more like this and never do another Cars.
the best movies of 2017 this and lady bird
Good but by no means a masterpiece; full of troupes and cliches.
when i stop crying i‚Äôll give this a proper review
Watched on new team and wow the colors really shined! Also I‚Äôm still a little confused why the Spanish wasn‚Äôt the initial dub for the movie but oh well.
I wish I could stop crying.
Well that was fabulous
Meh but fun. I loved the cultural storytelling and music and ofcourse the visuals. But it's a kid movie that is supposedly not enjoyed by adults unlike some animation films.
Can‚Äôt wait to hear Shea Serrano shit all over Ernesto de la Douche on VILLAINS
Long overdue. Nice, heartwarming, family animation.
The cutest
Yet another Disney Pixar movie that made me cry my eyes out, I wasn‚Äôt okay after this.
can‚Äôt stop crying
One of my all time favourite movies from Disney & Pixar. A story about a young kid who all he wants to do is play music and listen to music but for some mysterious reason, it is banned in his household. Day of the dead then comes around and he discovers the other side and has to get back to the living side before he is trapped there forever. Upton his travels, he meets his supposed ancestor who is a famous successful musician who turns out to be a real asshole only for this not to be true and he eventually finds his real great great grandfather or whatever. This film really does a great job of normalizing death for young children and showing them that death is part of life and as long as you always remember them, they will always be with you. Death is such a taboo subject especially in the UK, however this film breaks this barrier and portrays death in a sad, yet warming way as if to shy away from the taboo and show there is nothing scary about it.
A NEW PERSONAL RECORD! Started crying at the 10:35 mark  I would lay down my life for coco, the lady and the film
When it turns out everyone in your family is a good person. üëå
this film is full of life and beautiful colours. every attention to detail was adorable and the music was spectacular.
Coco is another triumph for Pixar, a company that has raised the art of the animated film to new heights with almost every film (almost ‚Äì we‚Äôre looking at you Cars 2 and The Little Dinosaur). A celebration of life set against the Mexican holiday The Day of The Dead, Coco follows Miguel, a little boy in love with music, and his journey to be an individual in a very family-centered existence. A classic hero‚Äôs journey, it is bursting with vibrant color and drop-dropping wonder. The animation is simply breathtaking ‚Äì Coco herself, as an old lady, is an amazing example, as are the lush vistas that make up the land of the dead, with hidden skulls replacing Disney‚Äôs hidden Mickeys. When you look from the original Toy Story to Coco, the leaps in the craft are astonishing. When dreck like The Emoji Movie and Boss Baby are dotting theaters, it‚Äôs always great to know that the next Pixar film is never too far away. www.flickersinthedark.com
I cry every time
I‚Äôll just defer to Julian Towers on this one; makes me sick to parse a Pixar movie like it‚Äôs anything quantitative, to not be a kid anymore (I say, as a barely-technically-an-adult 19 year old) and just enjoy this stuff for what it is. It‚Äôs why sentences like, ‚Äúthe Yalomian notion of remembrance constituting a second and final death is interesting, but ultimately only sees play as yet another Disney time-limit Macguffin‚Äù get cut from the initial review so that I can venomously place them here, hoping that they‚Äôll coagulate into some form of ironic thesis. Still had a really good time with this though. I like the colors, and the ‚ÄúRemember Me‚Äù song.
This is one of the best Disney Pixar films imho. Loved the vibrant colors in the Land of the Dead. It makes me emotional because Coco has an uncanny resemblance to my own grandmother and I'm extremely close to her. So when Miguel sings to her it gets me everytime. 10/10
this movie was sweet and the music was beautiful
I thought it was good but perhaps I came in with too lofty of expectations since critics and audiences alike seem to have put the film on a skyscraper of a pedestal. The vocal performances are good and the animation is perhaps the best and most colorful of Pixar's to date, and the music is very good, I just didn't feel the same connection to it that everybody else seems to have. Good movie, but not Pixar's best.
This is something that Inside Out should've done, embraced it's world, like Coco does. The animation is absolutely beautiful, the ending is heartbreaking, but I still would've liked to see some better development with members of the family.
bf and i woke up singing remember me to eachother 5 STARS
"Coco" is now my son's favorite movie. For sure, it is not the greatest Pixar film but I would judge "Coco" to be in Pixar's upper tier. Miguel loves playing guitar, there is something within him, but he is confronted with his family's multi-generational ban on music. Boy, do they uphold this. So Miguel travels to the after-life to look for his great-great grandfather who was a legendary singer. The after-life is a spectacle to look at: colorful and designed with cities extended into the sky. The focus on family generational legacy is really cool with how both negative and positive decisions can affect the lineage. The ending of the movie is also deeply inspiring and moving. "Coco" is a very good movie.
Got better as it went on with a great finale. #tears
It's hard to put into words how rich this film is in every aspect. From environments to emotion there is so much depth to Coco and it results in probably Pixar's finest film. It's just beautiful. The art and lighting is absolutely spot on and the detail in the background is extraordinary, especially watching it for a second time. The characters are lovable and relatable and the pacing is great - something Pixar doesn't quite hit for me every time. A once in a generation film!
I told my friends I needed to watch a movie that would make me cry and they chose this and BOY DID IT DO ITS JOB
cried so many but in a good way
A well-intentioned movie trying to highlight parts of a specific culture (and does it quite well -- I think?) but unfortunately is like many other movies in another respect -- it doesn't make much sense. Now, I'm not talking about the "living boy enters the spirit world" part, that's all fine. More so, what person would banish something that they love from their life and the lives of all their descendants (to the point where they hate and fear it) because of heartbreak? Why would those descendants do a heel face turn on their generations-long stance on music without really any prompting? Why would someone marrying into this family accept this position so readily? Why would the emotional abuse by the grandmother be just brushed over under the message that "family is the most important thing"? She destroyed the boy's most prized possession and his dreams in a traumatic way! She never even apologizes. Also, why did Hector not disappear when the last person who remembers him died? That should've still happened. Also, the movie was incredibly predictable, sans the one part that was slightly darker than I expected it to be. It's pretty yes, and at least it doesn't make sense in a setting different than the Western lilywhite like other movies, but I still expected better from Pixar.
I was high when I watched this movie.
i loved this so¬†much. so so much.
I can't even begin to express what a beautiful film this was... a wonderfully crafted story with richly developed characters that brought me to tears.
Pixar's ability to emotionally destroy me has reached new heights.
I‚Äôm upset now because I‚Äôm scared I‚Äôll be forgotten.
Pixar show again they know how to produce a great story and good music. The music felt very much in keeping with the movie rather than simple good pop songs. Highly recommended.
I can‚Äôt think of a better film in recent memory that nails the ending this well. still enjoyed this a lot the second time around
I love this movie but literally this is the 100th time I‚Äôve seen it sooooooo it‚Äôs getting kinda old. These kids i look after better find a new favorite movie.
It's Just So Good.
A beautiful world realized with the true Pixar craft, I just wish it was quite so predictable.
A very solid animated movie from Pixar with great messages about family. Has one of the most touching endings to an animated film that I‚Äôve seen.
I was originally not going to see this. I thought it wasn‚Äôt worth seeing at the time, until it was on Netflix and I decided to give it a try. Amazing. I cried. Maybe cause I‚Äôm sentimental? I dunno. It gave me major ‚ÄúThe Book of Life‚Äù vibes, and I LOVED that movie. Still, I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs the best Pixar movie out there. I misjudged it, I‚Äôm glad I had a change of heart.
The dog is basically Ed the stupid hyena from Lion King.
pixar has gone and done it again
Loved it! Amazing
Lots of cool stuff happening all over the screen in this movie, the visual gags are incredibly imaginative, and I loved that! It's a bit predictable but yeah, this is a Pixar movie, it isn't the point. The point is to tug at your heartstrings (pun intended) and bring you into an adventure worth telling, and this one definitely is. The whole "you need to remember your family" dynamic was interesting and a great central plot concept. I guess I don't have much else to say except that it was well made! I like movies with musical numbers in them. I like movies with driven protagonists, I like adventure movies, and I like movies that know when to cool down and when to ramp up the excitement, which is, well, this movie in a nutshell. I also like animation movies overall so yeah, right up my alley.
I wouldn't say it's Pixar's best, as it was constantly announced. Plot-wise it's not super original, not a fan of the dialogue either. But the animation is fantastic, and the culture is well represented. And the main song... We all cried whenever it played, of course; it's simple yet so touching. Bright and colorful and great movie.
even though I'm not Mexican and dia de Los muertos is not a real deal in my family but there is a version of it in my Latino country, it was so refreshing and emotional to me see so many things I could culturally relate do Miguel which is literally my grandpa name. it's a beautiful movie, thank you for this.
catch me crying in the club bc of coco  bonus points for me falling in love with Dante, yet another animated animal portrayed as stupid similar to Heihei in Moana
Second time watching it, and it‚Äôs still AWESOME!!! How can you hate this film?! (unless you‚Äôre an asshole) The culture represented in this film seems wonderful and respectful. I don‚Äôt know how close it is to the actual culture, but at least it‚Äôs good to know that Pixar is trying to do justice with the Hispanics. The story is certainly aimed at a younger audience, but it‚Äôs still a story that all ages can enjoy! I mean, I was crying at the last scene so hard! Voice cast is wonderful and animation is fabulous! 3D animation is definitely Pixar‚Äôs trademark, and they keep improving on their game. Probably the amazing part I noticed after watching for the second time, was how the colors were so beautiful and saturated. It was visually mesmerizing with its neon colors. It‚Äôs really hard to balance out colors. It especially can be harder when you‚Äôre doing it from scratch. But it‚Äôs beautiful!!! Watched it again because I wanted to show it to my mom, and she loved it as well! I‚Äôm glad I watched it again! In my mind, it‚Äôs one of Pixar‚Äôs best!!!
One of the most touching, beautiful and powerful of Pixar's films.
Ahhhhh the old hero villain switcheroo. Still, thoroughly enjoyable throughout and slightly more original and refreshing. Pixar will beat out full blown Disney films any day.
I had wanted to see this and kept meaning to see it but it just didn't happen. But then one night I found myself on a plane from New York (where I go to school) to California (where I grew up). I had had to switch flights because of a storm and ended up in business class, something I've never experienced before. To say the least, it was weird. For reference, I'm Mexican-American. I grew up in a middle-class family around other middle-class people. But since I've gone away to school (to a very expensive school with many wealthy students and very few Latinx students), I've become more and more attuned to the behavior of people much more wealthy than myself. I had never been around "rich" people before and I often felt out of place. And so, on that plane, I was feeling like this little poor Mexican weirdo and kept being creepily polite to the flight crew in an attempt to compensate for the rudeness of my fellow passengers. When I feel anxious like I did that night, I try to surround myself with things that make me feel at home. Listening to my favorite music, wearing my favorite t-shirt, etc. My new seat allowed me a meal and I ordered the tamales, although they were the "rich white people" version of tamales. I didn't care that much. And, to accompany my food, I decided to watch Coco. I started crying before the movie even officially started. As soon as the Disney logo sequence played, I was in tears. As I'm sure you know, every Disney film starts with the Disney castle and a rendition of "When You Wish Upon a Star". Coco was the same except this time the song was played by a mariachi band. I was on board with everything Coco would throw at me from that moment on. Coco is not a perfect film, but it is what I needed that night. It made me feel seen and so happy, even when I was crying. And that is enough.
Coco is another great film from the Pixar Renaissance era (not that the films from 2011-2013 were all bad (the only one I haven't seen is Cars 2, which has the lowest RT and Metacritic ratings)). Focusing on the Mexican festival of the Day of the Dead (which Disney were controversially going to trademark but fortunately didn't) and having a protagonist caused people to compare it to the film "The Book of Life", released a few years earlier, but both have been critically praised and enjoy large fanbases. I haven't seen the book of life yet, but I have it on DVD. Now, to recap the story of Coco:In Santa Cecilia, Mexico, a 12 year old boy named Miguel Rivera dreams of becoming a musician. However, as his great-great-grandmother Imelda had her husband leave her (and their daughter Coco) to pursue a musical career and never returned, the Rivera family has banned music for decades and so Miguel practices in secret. The family works as cobblers/shoemakers, but when Miguel discovers that the family maybe related to (i.e. Imelda's husband was) famous musician/actor (and ersatz Elvis) Ernesto de la Cruz, his idol. His family won't accept Miguel's ambition, and he runs away and enters the D√≠a de Los Muertos talent contest. Miguel breaks into Ernesto's mausoleum and takes his guitar, but ends up in the Land of the Dead as a result (invisible to the living). Fortunately, the Calacas (Skeletons) of Miguel's deceased family are there and his stray dog friend Dante can still see him. However, they still dislike music (well, mostly Imelda) and won't let him play music. Miguel meets fellow musician Hector and they go on a journey to meet Ernesto in the afterlife whilst chased by Miguel's family and Imelda's Alebrije (spirit guardian), the cat like dragon Pepita. Making things more complex is Miguel is turning into a calaca and Hector isn't remembered by his family, slowly fading away into non-existence, so they need to get their quickly so Miguel can return home and so Hector's photo can be displayed on an ofrendas so he'll be remembered by his family. Eventually the heroic duo meet up with Ernesto, but it's here where there's a twist in the story. Ernesto is not Miguel's great-great-grandfather, Hector is Miguel's real great-great-grandfather, and when Hector got cold feet and decided to return home to his family, Ernesto poisoned and killed Hector, then stole his music. Ernesto then traps the duo in a pit but they are rescued by the other Riveras. They defeat Hector and reveal the horrible truth about him to the rest of the land of the dead, Imelda now being fine with his musical dream and then Miguel goes home and tells his (living) family the truth, signing a song to make his great-grandmother, Coco, happy. The family finally accepts his musical dream. One year later, Miguel has a new baby sister who he tells all about his family history. Hector is now rightfully the famous one as the pedestal for Ernesto has now been shattered as people found out the truth. Great-Grandmother Coco passed away and she is reunited with her parents as a calaca, and Hector, Imelda and Coco go to visit the Riveras while Miguel plays music to celebrate his family. Coco is a great Disney/Pixar Classic, with a great setting and art aesthetic, likeable characters, great use of music and songs, good messages/morals, fun and playful humour and respect for Mexico's traditions and culture. The Twist Villain thing is starting to get a bit repetitive, but Ernesto's evil plan is more or less complete by the time the story starts so it's a little different in that sense. I'm sure this film will be enjoyed by kids and adults around the world for decades to come!

Damn, I'm not sure if a flick has turned me into a blubbering mess quite like this one. This movie features a great heel turn, fun story, mushy mushy mushy warm cozy family feelings, and beautiful imagery.
when it‚Äôs right it‚Äôs RIGHT
Much respect and thank to the creative heads behind this.. and you people will be remembered for a good long time for creating such film so you don't need to worry about fading out from the after-life world!!
crying
i haven‚Äôt cried this hard at a disney movie since toy story 3
My favorite Pixar movie to date. Great visuals and songs. It did Mexican culture justice and had me crying in the theatre.
This movie brought me to TEARS!! And seeing little Mexican boys dress up as Miguel since this movie came out has been so !!!<3
The plot shortened by me So basically, Miguel's family hates music, but he loves it, so you already know he's going to get into an argument and go to music. ‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢ The good This movie looks amazing! One of the best looking Pixar films. That, and all the acting is great an believable. This film also almost.. ALMOST, had me in tears. Next thing that was great was the music. I loved the music for this movie! That and the soundtrack, it's so memorable. Lastly, the plot. It was so intriguing and wonderful.. And it had a message at the end. Family always comes first ‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢ The best scene The ending. Not gonna spoil it, but just the ending. ‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢ The bad Nothing. This film was incredible. ‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢ Moms rating 4.5/5
This was so cute. I considered giving this a higher rating but I think it fell a little short in the exposition. This film was interesting because story-wise it doesn't really have many unique elements, however it touches on things that are far more challenging than other Pixar films. This surprised me as Disney typically lives to pander (this was obviously not void of pandering, but it definitely had some elements that I would consider darker than other Disney films). The characters were fun and entertaining (though I did find Miguel could have been a little more dynamic). The films biggest strength is probably how goddamn beautiful it was. The animation, the colours, they really hit home for me. Also, this film pulled on my heartstrings a little more than other Pixar films. Overall a really great film and definitely ranks high in my favourite Pixar films.
The end is so unbelievably heartwarming that I don‚Äôt think anyone can be able to speak objectively about the film for a least a week after watching.
I CRIED IN THIS MOVIE AND IM A HEARTLESS BASTARD SUCH A GREAT MOVIE WITH THE BEST CHARACTERS ONE OF MY FAVORITE ANIMATED MOVIES EVER I JUST WANTED TO APPLAUSE IN THE THEATRE WHEN THE CREDITS ROLLED
i just cried harder than i ever have watching this i love mama coco with my whole heart
One day I will watch this movie and not cry.... probably not.
it‚Äôs a movie with no flaws
For me the movie started out slow, truthfully though that might have been because of the mood I was in, which was grumpy. However I am super glad I stuck with it because by the end I was in love with the movie. For me the strength of a Pixar movie is that a kid can watch them and enjoy them on a kid‚Äôs level, but an adult can watch them on a completely different level, Coco was no exception to this
by now this movie is probably on a lot of watch mojo ‚Äòtop 10 movies to watch when u want to cry ur eyes out‚Äô lists
First movie I‚Äôve put off and it was amazing I regret taking such a long time to see it
Defiantly is pixar most underated movies I had a few tears in this movie
I listen to this soundtrack every morning and no one can stop me
Wow This story is so overflowing with love¬† It is like the only movie I regret not having seen in theaters it‚Äôs so visually striking/rich, Fuck a Dunkirk Prob the most comforting existential crisis I‚Äôll ever have
Not a big animation head, but wow this blew me away. I laughed, I cried, I ‚Äúaww‚Äù-ed. So cute and such a good story.
Everything movies( not just animated movies) should be doing to get out of the rut it's in currently. Until the movies start to improve, sweet, well crafted movies like this will do nicely. But it's a sad state of affairs when the best movies are animated kid movies. Oh well, may Pixar continue to put the adult hipster filmmakers to shame with there beautifuly humanist, inspiring movies.
Just as good as everyone has said and more than deserving of all the praise. Easily one of Disney/Pixar‚Äôs best by a wide margin.
I mean, it's a fairly standard Pixar affair, but it's also very pretty
hi it's literally been years since I've cried this hard during a movie !!!!!
Coco is beautiful. When the title gains meaning, even more. The ending part can move to tears. But it's not perfect, and the reason is just how predictible it is. Like "oh man, so this guy is ..." and the ending part with "why are you using words, use the fucking guitar!!". And, well, "all's well that ends well", like usual. It's a child(ish) movie afterall. Anyway, as previously said, it's beautiful like all Pixar works. Watch it.
shoot! i wasn‚Äôt gonna cry here :/
This is why I'm scared of watching Disney films at the cinema, I always end up a crying mess, especially with the ones about family like this one. Also, how fukn pretty was this? So many colors, it was such a joy to watch.
i‚Äôve seen this movie too many times to count but i cry every god damn time
I enjoyed this movie much more than I expected to, to be honest. One thing that really stuck out to me was how different it felt from other Disney movies‚Äîeven though it has a fantastical plot, it felt like one of the most real Disney movies I‚Äôve seen. Unlike many of their films, this one didn‚Äôt feel formulaic at all; it‚Äôs visually pleasing with a touching, original story.
I‚Äôm in love with the Coco Among Pixar‚Äôs best
'Coco' is such a sweet film. The music is beautiful and 'Remember Me' is a tear-jerker every time it's sung in the film. The animation is stunning as always with Pixar, especially the incredibly well-done intro. Everything looks amazing in the film, all the details are colorful and beautiful. However, 'Coco' is not perfect. The plot is a bit predictable and the rules of the dead are inconsistent or just don't make sense. Although, those flaws don't take away from the vast beauty and emotion of this film. Those flaws are easily overlooked with a movie like this, but they shouldn't go unacknowledged.
Really well done animation and voice acting. The main story is pretty good although the main twist is very obvious from the start. A great kids movie and nothing much after that
catch me openly crying each time i watch this
This is the most beautiful film i‚Äôve ever seen. Mexican culture is so wonderful‚ù§Ô∏è
Great animation, nice songs, touching story :-D Nice for a cozy night watch
Every boring Disney-movie ever, but in spanish.
Shit had me shook to my core!!!! Tearing tf up!!!!
Is there no limit to Pixar's imagination? This is a beautiful movie in every sense of the word. I wish I'd seen it in Spanish.
The extravagant details on the animation are astounding, and the narrative is interesting enough, even for adults. However, this film doesn't reach the maturity or emotional heights as Up or Toy Story 3 though that seems to be its goal and it looks like I'm in the minority. Maybe it's just that I personally disagree with the central premise; as a childless person I expect to be quickly forgotten but I don't believe that makes my life less worthwhile, so the importance of personal memory and being remembered fell flat to me. I do believe that collective history and tradition is meaningful, and on that end, the film succeeds in literal flying colors.
EU CHOREI TANTO QUE TO DIGITANDO COM AS L√ÅGRIMAS!
Godamn I think I dehydrated myself from crying.
Correctly. Animated. Guitar. Playing.
A genuine visual, musical, spiritual, philosophical l and, yes, gently political, treat from Pixar. Richly resonant with universal themes of family, loss, mourning, and regret, while maintaining a strong sense of Mexican identity. Bravo.
It's hard not to shed some tears especially when one already has close souls dwelling the land of the dead. Pixar throws here a huge card. But...can someone explain why the dog didn't go mad surrounded by so many bones? :)
Illumination and Sony are QUAKING.
