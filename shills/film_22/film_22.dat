How much up it‚Äôs own ass can a movie truly be? Jesus christ.  had a lot of good elements working for it, but i think brady corbet doesn‚Äôt know how to manage them in a more humble and honest way of storytelling. a star is born dominates.  (i‚Äôm also drunkenly writing this)
The ending (or lack thereof) was ass. I really enjoyed everything else tho. But who knows! Maybe tomorrow I‚Äôll wake up with a different opinion, or on a second watch it will sit better with me. The main thing I want to know is what I have to do in order to get Willem dafoe to narrate my life
BABY AVEC CASH  While also serving up an aggressively nihilistic middle finger to the very notion of humanism in the 21st century, Vox Lux¬†raises its other middle digit towards the expectations and desires of conventional cineastes everywhere (as evidenced especially¬†by the many oblivious ‚Äî and not so oblivious but still sore ‚Äî reviews on this very site), and I am here for it. This movie represents 21st century culture in a way that feels so, so depressingly, joyously, right. The antidote to A Star is Born‚Äôs pastiche of basic, moralistic takes on the same subjects. This review is dedicated to anyone who doesn‚Äôt like Natalie Portman‚Äôs performance, especially if you found it jarring, unlikable, or otherwise inaccessible. Scavenger Hunt #45 11/30 6. Watch a film with an actor/actress you dislike (Jude Law)
The fearless depiction of a school massacre remains one of cinema‚Äôs final frontiers. It is a subject matter so sensitive and easily exploited that when Brady Corbet opens his second directorial feature, Vox Lux, in 1999 with a gunman walking into a classroom and pulling the trigger on the teacher, the movie essentially says: Yes, this is going to be a provocative piece of filmmaking that will do justice to a taboo subject at long last. Corbet has come up with a terrific premise about an unlikely kind of celebrity that could emerge from a national tragedy. What‚Äôs disappointing is he turns that premise into a very cliched Behind the Music episode. Celeste (Raffey Cassidy), a survivor of the shooting, becomes an overnight sensation when she writes a song about the trauma and sings it at a funeral. The movie, however, is far more interested in showing Celeste perform and rehearse several numbers in their entirety than developing her character. Handed with little material to work with, Cassidy gives a wan performance, as if she were still playing the paralyzed daughter in The Killing of a Sacred Deer. And as written by Sia, the songs are fine, but every time the movie turns into a glorified music video, the story is at a standstill, which Corbet compensates by inserting overwritten narration from Willem Dafoe. After making an awkward connection to 9/11, the movie jumps to 2017 and finds Celeste, now played by Natalie Portman, as a jaded pop star complete with substance abuse issues and an estranged daughter (also played by Cassidy). Vox Lux links Celeste to another horrific act of violence, only much more tangentially this time, and Portman‚Äôs dressing room tantrums are at once generic and overacted. The movie then abruptly closes with a 15-minute concert sequence which manages to make the sight of Natalie Portman singing and gyrating to EDM in a catsuit shrill and tedious. In the end credits, Corbet dedicates the film to Jonathan Demme, which may explain the indulgent music scenes. Judging by Vox Lux, however, it appears Corbet may have taken stop making sense way too close to heart. Grade: D
üé∂ i-, i-, i-, i- üé∂ üé∂ i-, i-, i-, i- üé∂ üé∂ i-, i-, i-, i- üé∂ üé∂ i-, i-, i-, i- üé∂ I. Loved. This. Shot on gorgeous Kodak 35mm film stock that was treated so well!!! In the last couple of years most movies shot on 35mm end up¬†looking identical to digital. Negatives are so cleaned up these days they end up erasing the precious texture and grain but Vox Lux got it soooo right. I read an interview with DP Lol Crawley where he mentions purposely underexposing and forced processing the film to invoke the specific reality the script and performances played in, and when films have that level of detail they immediately have a special place in my heart. This is a fucking gorgeous and stylish horror movie, and the story of a woman who‚Äôs character traits are usually given to male roles. Natalie and Stacy Martin are great, but I think the real standout performance here is 16 year old Raffey Cassidy. Sure, this movie has its flaws, but there‚Äôs soooo much here that works so well for me not to give it a perfect score. The editing, sound design, Scott Walker‚Äôs compositions and Sia‚Äôs pop ballads?!?! I was not prepared.
A movie directed by the little brother from Assasination Nation. Corbett did it for the lols. I‚Äôm 100 percent here for this mean, bitter, cynical assault on the senses, despite the lack of any real resolution. I‚Äôm not just speaking in the narrative sense though, as that seemed like it would be a given, but rather how let down I was that the movie was more about throwing out whatever messages it could moment to moment rather than actually having something coherent to say about gun violence or pop music or toxic celebrity psychology or any number of issues that it sets it sights on. It‚Äôs a big dumb mess, but hey so is America! So is pop music! Right guys? Is that my take? TBH it just might be! I love Portman, her face in this has such a specific angularity that makes everything she does seem so uniquely ill-timed and misguided. Just like in Jackie or Black Swan, she channels her characters‚Äô grief into a million different little deviations from sanity in an incredibly watchable way. Also love my greasy king Jude Law and sad vanilla wafer Stacy Martin. All of these actors are so acutely attuned to the tone that Corbet is trying to set. The pitter patter of his self conscious, literary, kind of full of shit dialogue makes you feel like everyone on screen is supposed to represent something wrong with the way the world is. It‚Äôs honestly insane and I kinda can‚Äôt believe he pulled it off, especially on such a grand scale. Not for everybody of course, me and my buddy who was equally enamored with it could feel the air rushing out of the theater as we were watching it, and we were the only people seeing it. Desperate times, desperate measures maybe? Or maybe I‚Äôm just a sucker for Sia, in all of her relentless and vindictive glory!
... I can‚Äôt imagine what Celeste stans must be like.
When's the concert tour DVD coming out?
Natalie Portman is STUNNING in one of the best performances of her career (sorry, Black Swan). Takes a while to build and can be only slightly pretentious at times but otherwise is a fascinating, mesmerizing and dark look at America's obsession with celebrity and a life shaped by violence.
the best of 2018s ‚Äúhey this is how an artist is an artist‚Äù movies. raffey cassidy and natalie portman are really good in this. Not a big fan of the opening but everything that came after it in act 1 was very interesting to watch and was really entertaining. Act 2 was not as strong but still really good i just wish they kinda set up that thing they reveal at the end more.
I really like a lot of things about this movie on paper.. but the execution on really all of them, is just incredibly bland in my opinion. I love slow dialogue driven movies. But a lot of the nuanced themes and messages of the movie didnt really feel earned or impactful.¬† I really wanted to love this movie, I was really looking forward to it. But I have a lot of issues with the script and directing. Some of it felt pretty corny, I honestly just wasn‚Äôt buying it, the transformation of Natalie Portman‚Äôs character from who she was to who she became. The best part about this movie to me was definitely the opening. Pretty disturbing and effectively done. But once we started getting to the pop industry side of the movie, it just all felt incredibly dry. This is coming from someone who listens to A LOT of (indie/art) pop. And loves a good character study or social commentary especially if I feel there‚Äôs a lot of depth into it. But yeah.. I didn‚Äôt get much out of this at all. Which is a shame, I wanted to love it. I just didn‚Äôt find anything really exceptional in the movie, I think Natalia Portman gave a great performance with what she had to work with, but ultimately her potential felt squandered, to me.¬† I love her in really everything I‚Äôve seen her in, except this, but I don‚Äôt lay the fault on her shoulders at all.¬† Again, a lot of the narrative and commentary works on paper to me but I don‚Äôt feel like the movie executed it well.
It was a lot. But in the best way possible. Haven‚Äôt seen anything this refreshing in a while. Shocking. Heartbreaking in its absurdity. Also Natalie Portman was amazing?? Not a question, but a confused exclamation.
Had fun dancing in the theatre
WHAT..... this was just uhhhh. not necessary whatsoever. natalie portman was the only thing that made this film watchable. the direction is god awful. and a few scenes made me want to walk out of the theater. Don‚Äôt listen to anyone comparing this to I, Tonya. it‚Äôs not similar at all lmao.
While a film with a lot of flaws, the pros outweigh them considerably
this one's a bit of a head-scratcher for me. on the one hand, the music's great (sia's impact!), the visuals are specTACular (the title and end credits are delicious to look at), willem dafoe's narration adds a surprising amount of dramatic heft to the story, and it's one of the most ambitious, intense, and thematically daring films i've seen this year. on the other hand, its emotional impact is a bit stunted (mostly due to an anticlimactic finale), natalie portman's unhinged performance verges on unsympathetic and grating, and i wasn't sure what to make of the film's quasi-critical, slightly half-assed take on pop music and the commodification of tragedy. i was never bored, but i was never fully invested either.
If you managed to stop this movie right before the Act II title card, this would be one of the absolute best films of the year. Corbet crafts an outstanding thesis from a very good question: are we turning our victims into superstars? It explores some really remarkable ideas about celebrity and tragedy in a creative, exciting way. An hour into this, and I was ready to call Brady Corbet our next great filmmaker. And then they jumped forward in time and these themes just kinda... stopped? Suddenly, we have an interesting, yet meandering character study on Celeste at 31, now a mom and a full fledged superstar. Natalie Portman absolutely SLAYS in this role, but for what? Between Act II and Finale, Vox Lux becomes a fine enough film, albeit one that squanders its initial promise. The absolute biggest ball drop here is the lack of payoff involving the terrorism subplot. Celeste becomes a popstar based on a song she wrote after a school shooting she survived. She becomes a transgressive Gaga/Madonna figure, and then a group of terrorists shoot up a beach seventeen years later... dressed as characters from a Celeste video. But that‚Äôs merely a detail used as a way to get Celeste to say controversial things to the press and it never pays off. It‚Äôs not fair to judge a film for what it‚Äôs not, but when a film so strongly builds itself up to be something it ends up not being, it‚Äôs hard not to feel short changed. The entire Finale, regardless of the strange shift in message, is breathtaking. It‚Äôs Natalie Portman actually becoming a convincing popstar on screen, stage presence, lights show, pyrotechnics... electrifying. If only Vox Lux were as tightly put together as Celeste‚Äôs stage show.
everytime i watch this is gets better, natalie and raffey nailed it. WHY is this not getting any attention for awards, they were robbed truly
ambitious but feels unfinished. i feel for celeste though (awful dancing and emotional trauma).
Does Vox Lux eventually crack under the weight of its own ambition? Absolutely. Did that climax need to go on for as long as it did? Not really. But holy shit this thing was just ballsy enough to win me over. I knew as soon as it finished that I wanted to see it again. It also has one of my favorite musical scores of the year.
Even though I‚Äôm in love with Natalie Portman, I set that aside whenever I watch anything she‚Äôs in so I can give it a fair review. I just love all her stuff by coincidence.¬† This is so daring, complex, shocking, rough, divisive, and beautiful all at the same time. I knew I was in for something different going in, but still had no idea what to expect. Truly harsh critique of pop/celebrity culture. I‚Äôd rank Portman‚Äôs performance up there with her roles in Black Swan and Jackie. You don‚Äôt like her at all, but somehow you still sympathize with her.
How anyone liked this is beyond me. In the opening minutes, director and writer Brady Corbet uses a school shooting as a jumping off point for a film that honestly has nothing to do with domestic terrorism or violence. In the painful process of trying to create an interesting character, Corbet trivializes modern mass shootings and horrid violence, specifically against children, leading to one of the most embarrassing and self-indulgent films I've seen all year. If Corbet is trying to say something, that something is not present in this film. Is this film about terrorism? Not really. Is this film about mass shootings? I think it wants to be, but it's not. Is this film about being a celebrity? I guess, but it concerns itself a little too much with terrorism for me to feel like that's the whole point. Is this film about the link between tragedy and stardom? Maybe? Is this film somehow trying to purport some sort of thesis that connects pop music to terrorism? I sure hope not, because that's fucking stupid and offensive. Is this movie a critique of pop music, and is trying to use terrorism as a means of saying that pop music shouldn't be taken seriously? What the fuck is this movie trying to say? Also, nothing happens in this movie. I'll rewrite the script for you, right here. Celeste survives a school shooting, she writes a song about it and becomes a pop star. Fifteen years later, she performs on stage. The end. All of the scenes in this movie do nothing. They don't inform character, the dialogue is pointless and makes the characters unbearable, and the music is bad. This movie throws out a bunch of concepts and does nothing with them, and if you're going to try to make school shootings a key concept of your film, you better portray it in a way that's respectful and not confusing and misguided. What the fuck is this movie? And it's so self-important and up it's own ass. I was on the edge of my seat in the last thirty minutes because I was so excited to stand up and leave the theater as soon as I saw the first credit roll. The only redeeming factor of this movie is some cool cinematography. The performances are good, but the characters are truly awful. This movie has nothing to say, but it wants you to think it has everything to say. Truly insufferable. 2018 Ranked
A film that starts with a bang and ends in a fizzle, 'Vox Lux' impresses before it disappoints. Featuring a brilliant set of twin performances from Raffey Cassidy, along with a collection of mannered tics masquerading as performances from Natalie Portman and Jude Law, the film offers cinematic highs and lows in an uneven, uneasy mix. Brady Corbet is sure of neither story nor theme, delivering occasionally powerful set pieces that fail to come together in a meaningful whole. Corbet juggles multiple narrative balls here, some with great skill, but cannot quite create a meaningful pattern in the trajectories of each, nor in their crossing. The expository voiceover by Willem Dafoe doesn't help, layering the plot with portent undone by the purple prose. The vapid sounds of Celeste's music also ring false - for an artist ostensibly motivated by trauma, she traffics in surprisingly unmemorable bubblegum beats. Still, there are moments where Corbet and his troupe ‚Äì especially Cassidy ‚Äì shine, sometimes making us forget the distressing pointlessness of the entire affair. But then we return to the music and our disappointment, and wonder, what was the point of the shocking opener if it all just ends in stale pop tunes By the end, Corbet‚Äôs hyper-stylized 'Vox Lux' proves to be purely a concert for one, a thematically hollow mix of grad school philosophizing and exploding glitter.
Damn that was intense!!!! Can‚Äôt tell if the songs are good, purposefully bad, or bad. Oh well.¬† The Hologram music video seemed lit as shit.¬† Most importantly : this year, concerts were shot so superbly in movies. So good.¬† Most importantly : the acting was amazing Raffey Cassidy and Natalie Portman are God‚Äôs There was a q&a w the director and Portman afterwards and that was sick
One of the more underrated films of the year. I'm pretty sure it was Executive Produced by Jackson Maine.
Prologue: Stupid Choice Act 1: Bad Act 2: Interesting I never became interested in the screenplay, the choices Brady made with his camera are enticing. I'm willing to look at what he offers in the future, but as a screenwriter I'm not sold. The actors being reused at the same ages, over reliance on subtext, narration, and supernatural hints really kept me from me from getting into it. I wouldn't say it sucks empirically, but as a single viewer this unfortunately sucked to watch. Of note: had 3 walkouts.
Natalie Portman said FUCK the NRA.
first want to preface this, it‚Äôs not for everyone. Brady Corbet‚Äôs profile of desensitization and dismissiveness is flashy, uncomfortable, and insane but ultimately it‚Äôs one of the most visceral experiences I‚Äôve had in a theater.
I loved this movie and don't ask me why.
I don‚Äôt know if this was good it‚Äôs stressing me out but what I can tell you is Natalie Portman is a goddamn thespiAN
Saw the q&a this time. Natalie was THERE. Brady CORBET was thERE. They answered it of the questions I had about the film including the music... the process of WRITING the music and setting. I think it was better this time and even faster than last time. Although I do not think it‚Äôs the best movie of this year, I thinks VERY rewatchable and super fun to talk about. Not done. The subtitle ‚Äúa 21 century portrait‚Äù is so accurate now that I have thought more about the film. I can see myself seeing it again in the near future, which I can‚Äôt say about many films. Other than Lady Bird.
gave me a panic attack !
Kinda mixed on this as a whole, but decidedly un-mixed on the opinion that the concert sequence is absolutely haunting and it should win like 10 Oscars on its own.
Fascinating examination of modern society through the lens of celebrity, mass media, and terrorism. The deadpan narration from Willem Dafoe lends the commentary a chilly detachment. Also, this film is a lot more honest about its disdain for pop music than A Star is Born. That, plus being more wildly ambitious in reaching for the zeitgeist and passing the Bechdel-Wallace test make Brady Corbet‚Äôs¬†Vox Lux the superior work. Deadass.
So Vox Lux..... there was some stuff I liked but, the rest was not good. I enjoyed the parts with younger Celeste more then the Natalie Portman stuff to be honest.
I first saw this at the Chicago International Film Festival back in October and I really liked it. I didn't quite love it, but I've been thinking about it since I saw it, and after a second viewing, I can confidently say this: Vox Lux? More like Vox Fux. I love this damn movie. It's harrowing, hilarious, gleefully up its own ass, and cynical as hell while somehow managing to feel emotionally true. The Willem Dafoe narration is great too, framing the movie like a Behind the Music episode and adding to the self-awareness. There's a sharp balance between retrospection and immediacy that feels makes it operate in an uncanny grey area between the glitzy Eurotrash of latter-day Nicolas Winding Refn and‚Äîprepare for a blasphemous comparison here‚Äîsome of the themes and progression of Bob Fosse and John Cassavetes. I'm not saying it's refined as the latter two, of course, because this movie is kind of a glorious mess. And that's kind of the point. Defining the 21st century by endless tragedies and the hit-or-miss art we use to numb the pain is a pretty bitter viewpoint, but Corbet makes it work. The trauma, the glassy-eyed pity, the way we thrash around to evade our pasts‚Äîit sings volumes. Oh, and I wasn't sure about it on my first viewing, but that pointedly generic choreography towards the end is a riot. Original capsule review here.
Liked parts but I personally could care less about the life of a pop star.
This shit was fuckin nuts. I kinda loved it. I‚Äôm really pissed no one is talking about this movie. Natalie Portman is phenomenal. As are Jude Law and Raffey Cassidy. The music is awesome and so are the costumes/makeup as well. People need to see this film
Entirely up it's own ass, pitched (both performance wise and tonally) completely wrong, has no clue what (if any) point it actually wants to make, and yet there is some fun to be had in its guileless pretense. This is a film that will ominously zoom in on the New World Trade Center as horns blare to remind the audience that POP MUSIC and TERRORISM are all part of the cynical and gross American culture. The audacity and clumsiness of stuff like this are kind of fun to chuckle at as Corbett makes a rather entry level Social Studies class commentary about the music industry. But credit where credit is due. It looks amazing, the score by Scott Walker and original songs by Sia are fantastic, and Willem Dafoe makes a great narrator. Kind of an insult Jonathan Demme though.
so ..... uhhh the end of the movie ¬†was underwhelming but the first act and second act saved me from hating it
yes i saw this in theaters three times in a single week... AND!!!!!!! the q&a was amazing and really answered questions i had about the film, and natalie portman is so beautiful and intelligent :,))))
One of my most anticipated films of the year, and one of the biggest disappointments. Natalie Portman and Raffey Cassidy gave great performances, but the editing (to many montages), and the narration (why?), ruined it for me.
Well, that was disappointing! The entertainment industry being used to exploit tragedies isn't exactly a novel concept, yet Corbet and co. treat it such. In this film, the worst tendencies of filmmakers like Winding Refn and others are on display, and Natalie Portman gives us her best Nicholas Cage impression. The best scene in the film takes place within the first 10 minutes, and it's all downhill from there.
God damn, there's a lot to unpack. Just go see it.
Bowling For Columbine 2: A Star Is Born
I don't know what I was talking about in my first review, this film is perfect. It's shocking and confusing and subverts all expectations in the greatest ways. A second viewing is absolutely required for Vox Lux.
Did Celeste receive counseling at any point? She may want to consider it. A hot mess of a movie. Some of it I loved (the music, the cinematography, Raffey Cassidy), some of it I really disliked (the narrative didn‚Äôt totally gel for me, Natalie Portman...sorry guys). But it‚Äôs definitely the kind of bold filmmaking I appreciate and an excellent conversation piece. And ABBA makes a brief appearance in a montage so there‚Äôs that.
the other girlies WISH they could pull off a perfect critique of 21st century culture and the nuances of modern pop music
It wasn‚Äôt until about halfway through this movie that I realized how weird of a guy I am. There I am sat by myself in an empty regal theater in my bullshit liberal arts college town. Anyway, I loved this movie. Without saying too much, Corbet‚Äôs sophomore feature is just as enigmatic and fascinating as his debut. I will say though this is much better than Childhood of a Leader. It‚Äôs so well shot, acted, scored and definitely very well directed. The tone Corbet creates in this movie is just so unique and hypnotic. Aspects remind me of Gaspar Noe‚Äôs, I Stand Alone and of course Haneke‚Äôs stark style of filmmaking makes an appearance.¬† I love this film buts its really hard to talk about after seeing it just once, especially since I‚Äôm dancing around tons of aspects that I valued seeing so much without knowing what was coming. Hopefully, I‚Äôll see it again in the next couple days but I just look forward to experiencing this film again.
brady corbet wants to be hanake so bad and y'know what? i fuck with that. maybe one day he will be. but for now we've got this, and i mean, it tries. songs are dope af tho.
????? i don‚Äôt even know what to say?????? this was so crazy from start to finish. if you‚Äôre planning on watching this, don‚Äôt read any reviews or articles about it!! act 1 was so dark and unexpected, some ppl walked out after the first 10 minutes (understandably). this reminds me of assassination nation (kind of) where the shock factor is what makes this movie so good to me. i think if i were to watch this more than twice i would not enjoy it very much. i feel like the ending was too abrupt, but also it fits so well with the entire movie. also...the feeling her performance in act 3 gave me...thank you so much i‚Äôm now a #Celestenator. hi miss natalie portman you were so good in this!!!!!!¬†  It doesn‚Äôt matter if you‚Äôre Michelangelo or Mikey and Angelo from New Brunswick
This movie knocked my socks off. I don't know how else to say it. I was expecting a sort of high-camp take down of fading pop stardom, and that certainly is embedded in this season of socially-induced trauma masqued in a narcissistic haze of unbridled emotion, but there is so much more to unpack.¬†  The unexpected first act immediately set me off balance in a way I found at first exploitative, before, much later, realizing the true genius behind such a set up. However, long before all that, I was calmed by the dulcet tones of our narator, Willem DeFoe, playing as much the self rationalizing voice inside our star's head as he is the omniscient narrator he initially appears to be. Therein lies what's transcendent about this cinematic experience.¬†  Everything about this film comes out you loud and fast and in your face. It's big in everyway it can be. Most of the time you think you see exactly what Corbat and Portman are up too and you are pretty sure you've seen it before, better with more nuance and complexity. However, just then a piece will click into place and you'll realize there actually was more there under the hood than you were giving them credit for, and, even when there isn't, you just have to applaud everyone's commitment to go for it as hard as they do.¬†  PS Have I told you I'm a sucker for character studies of oversized narcissists? This might explain a few things.
a star is stillborn
They should have gotten Robyn to write the music!!!
Stunning,the choices made in this even from the silent end credits made me speechless.In my top 3 for the year.
Maybe it was ahead of its time
38 A twentieth century portrait.¬† In dedication to Jonathan Demme.¬† Demme wouldn‚Äôt dare put his name on this ostentatious trash. There‚Äôs nothing worth than an overwrought art film, let alone one as unoriginal and slapdashed as this one.¬† La Dolce Vita this is not.
This is an incredibly artistic and impressive film. At times stark and jarring... well not even at times, there‚Äôs a lot of stark and jarring, but the absurd honesty it has in itself is so appealing that I couldn‚Äôt really bring my self to dislike any of it too a certain degree. I do personally still prefer A Star Is Born, but I think they are very different movies with very different things to say. I‚Äôm somewhat dancing around the deeper discussion topics because I want people to see it for themselves. Portman is incredible, as always. Like seriously, was there any doubt. Raffey Cassidy was fuckin wonderful! And holy shit Jude Law! Jude law juuling! Jude Law acting! He was great!!
I don‚Äôt think this film fully accomplished what it set out to do.¬† That being said, Natalie Portman is everything.
Yo dude someone get Brady Corbet on the line, tell that woke king his movies are too good!! Also ask him if he‚Äôs ever been to a concert because I‚Äôm not so sure¬† üÖ±Ô∏èOX üÖ±Ô∏èUX BEST PICTURE 2019
Vox Lux is so strange and risky that I can‚Äôt help but applaud it. The multiple odd choices makes this stand out as one of the most interestingly set-up films I‚Äôve seen lately. It‚Äôs presented as a chronicle of a pop star‚Äôs career and, you totally get that, but it does so much more. Surprisingly narrated by the venerable Willem Dafoe, we are jolted into the world that is being presented. Quite literally. I nearly lost my seat. Raffey Cassidy captures us with innosense and a naive sense of who Celeste is.¬† After making our way through such unique and interesting time lapses, we are once again pulled into another chapter in her life. This works in a similar way to the first half, but loses the innocence and trades it in for raw vulnerability.¬† Natalie Portman does what every actor desperately strives for: transformation. While I can‚Äôt commend her singing voice, it truly doesn‚Äôt matter. It‚Äôs not about the music. For Celeste, it isn‚Äôt about the music. It‚Äôs about the fans. More specifically, how the fans make her feels. This film is about Celeste and no one else. Of course there are some wonderful performances by Jude Law, Stacy Martin, and Jennifer Ehle. However, we all came to see what Natalie and Raffey give to create the role of Celeste. Vox Lux doesn‚Äôt care what you think. Vox Lux is here to put on a show. How many of you have cried yourself to sleep at night?
Our cultural institutions feed on the¬†moral rot beating at the heart of everything, smearing voided blood across their face. We are humanity‚Äôs afterbirth. As the earth catches fire and its oceans drown us, we will suffocate while sublimating every horrorible truth in service of our decadence. In one billion years, the universe will have forgotten us‚Äîour smallness, our conceited ambition‚Äîand once again be still.
Bradley Cooper and Lady Gaga? Not this time. Natalie Portman? Always.
UM THIS IS A LOT.
THERE ARE NO WORDS
Independent cinema‚Äôs take on a Star is Born, but so so so much more. A movie hasn‚Äôt left me this excited in a while ‚ú®  update: it‚Äôs 1:02am and I‚Äôm still processing the opening scene of this film. I don‚Äôt think the adrenaline has warn off yet. üòØüí≠
baby avec cash this film transcends review
This film is so bizarre, but I‚Äôm so on board with it.
I'm not sure if I loved it or hated it...
Completely not what I was expecting it to be. I did not expect the origin angle they took with Portman's character but I thought it was amazing and incredibly powerful. This movie is just directed to greatness, especially the final concert scene.
idk....i loved it???? it was dark and twisted and desperate and weird and completely out of left field and raffey cassidy is a POWERHOUSE
So.... was the music supposed to be bad?
Natalie Portman is amazing as this character, but Raffey Cassidy in dual roles as the young version and her daughter really brought it all together.
The chaos hurts. So we try to drown it out, to speak up, to communicate some kind of meaning, to scream against the dark, to shout until it doesn‚Äôt hurt anymore - but the chaos is still there, and now it‚Äôs just noisier. Vox Lux combines modern American pain and modern American hope into one big unwieldy package, crafting a gorgeous film that might be just as brilliant as it is messy. Still not entirely sure what the film‚Äôs trying to say underneath all the shock and flash, and it‚Äôs definitely pretentious, but who cares when it feels this good. Or, rather, makes me feel this bad.
Intoxicating. I have next to no interest in the material, but the fairly straightforward story is complimented (enriched, even) by Corbet's unconventional formal approach that immediately disarmed me and left me stunned throughout. It's complex, bold, moving, and haunting. I'll likely get more detailed after a rewatch.
I feel like I loved it but also would never care to see it again?
No one told me the back half of this was basically a Kanye circa 2010 biopic. So of course I loved it (and I'm sorry about that). Not sure I'm totally sold on Portman's performance in this (which is surprising, because I almost always love her even when I don't love the movie)... but everything else? It worked for me, I don't know what to tell you.
Vox Lux from director Brady Corbet is one of the years best and most beautiful films. A cynical look at modern pop culture. It sucks, it‚Äôs not unique at all and only exists to serve the brainless masses. Celeste (played by Natalie Portman who is hamming it up) during her lunch even talks about how her music videos are bad. 21st century pop culture is nothing more than a temporary escape from the horrors of the real world and Celeste‚Äôs music (which is indistinguishable from one another pop songs) is the gateway. On top of this there are a lot of moving pieces with this film. So many that it should not work but somehow does. I could talk for hours about how tragedy creates stars, the relationship between stars, their relationship with their own children and many other things. Corbet‚Äôs style of film-making is perfect for this story. Lot‚Äôs of visual storytelling going on for those that can read into it. Intentionally artsy and bound to be hated by the masses. Not much more to say. I would recommend watching Vox Lux with as little information going in as possible. It‚Äôs funny, dark and a good look at our world all wrapped up in one of the years most mesmerizing movies. The fact that this is playing on the smallest screen at my theater while Immortal Engines and the 100th Spider-Man movie are both on 10+ screens says it all.
celeste is in the illuminati
Stunning, but disappointingly empty. (a parallel to general pop music?) This is the portrait of a pop icon on the level of Lady Gaga, Katie Perry, Rihanna, etc, but whose inspiration and comeuppance blossomed out of violent tragedy similar to the real-life event of the Columbine shooting. I should start by saying that I liked it, especially everything visual. There were some pretty ballsy creative decisions made here, not the least of which was to roll the damn credits ten minutes into the film over a great driving montage. "Critics are raving" about Natalie Portman + Jude Law (who are both precious and did great), but anyone who saw this knows that Raffey Cassidy is the real star here.  [sorta spoilers ahead]  The thing is, the intended climax was so empty/unsatisfying that when it was over I almost laughed. There's a very serious revelation given by the narrator right near the end that was so interesting to me, and I thought: "Yes! It's gonna pull a last-minute 'Black Swan' and slap me sideways!" It did not. The most compelling parts of this movie are watching Celeste deal with the aftermath of the shooting and begin the road to stardom, and I think opportunity was lost in the jump from 2001 to 2017. And the fact that the second shooting of the film had no lasting impact or connection to the main story is such a WASTE. Did the writers not know what they truly wanted to say with this piece? Was the vision so unclear?
Natalie Portman is unsurprisingly out-acted by the actress playing her younger self and her daughter (don't ask.) The decision to age only one character over a period of 18 years was curious at best, and distracting at worst, but still not as bad as the pretentious voice-over narration or the grating pop music at the center of it all.
Y‚Äôall. I‚Äôm losing my entire GAY MIND!!!! Talented, brilliant, incredible, amazing, show-stopping, spectacular, etc.... it‚Äôs not a cautionary tale about the art of celebrity as much as it is a modern retelling of Faust (which is made pretty clear at the end). It‚Äôs not a story about the loss of innocence as much as it is a story about not growing up. And it‚Äôs not a catchy pop song as much as it is a night at the opera. It attempts to be an amalgamation of pop culture in the 21st century told on a biblical scale and for the most part, it succeeds.¬† I totally get why people aren‚Äôt liking this; it‚Äôs cold, it‚Äôs uncompromising, there‚Äôs not a single sympathetic character.... and the biggest complaint seems to be the jarring shift between the first act and the second, but if you‚Äôre asking me, all of it works. The intimate and quiet nature of the first act is replaced with chaos in both visuals and dialogue to really convey where this character is now and what she‚Äôs become, and Raffey Cassidy completely sells both acts alone. Sorry to be a bitch.... but this really is everything¬†A Star Is Born wishes it was.... many will deny it but it‚Äôs the truth!
Them gyrations
The choreography is awful and the last songs are awful but it makes sense. Everyone‚Äôs performance is AMAZING but Natalie Portman is the highlight of the movie.
The creation and life of a pop star as 21st Century America, with figurative (and possibly literal?) apocalypses bobbing around the margins. Horrifying and darkly funny. Features competing scores, one by Sia and one by Scott Walker. Okay!
VOX LUX is an interesting, if not incredibly flawed breakdown of the degradation that occurs on the road to pop-stardom. We see a young, idealistic woman who uses music to shape her perception of tragedy become a rambling, Madonna-esque conspiracy theory idiot over the course of the film‚Äôs 90-minute runtime. Unfortunately, we only get to see this as a juxtaposition, as a jarring 16-year jump that comes an hour into the film skips over the transformation process that, frankly, may have been more interesting to watch than what actually makes it on-screen. Additionally, a consistent VO pervades the film, filling in backstory and betraying any sense of subtlety that may have come with it. Nevertheless, this film does quite a bit well. The gun violence at the center of the film is incredibly timely and sobering, while Corbet accomplishes his goal of f showing the shallow nature of pop via his protagonist‚Äôs flippant, insincere attitude toward real-world problems that would have previously engaged her. Her complete disconnection with reality is one of the more fascinating aspects of the film. Additionally, Raffey Cassidy is excellent playing dual roles in the film as young Celeste and, later, Celeste‚Äôs teenage daughter. She absolutely knocks her role out of the park and, in many moments, actually upstages Portman. Part of the issue with Portman‚Äôs performance is her actual on-stage singing and dancing work left quite a bit to be desired. I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs on her or the choreography team, but it actually takes the viewer out of the film a bit, since it‚Äôs difficult to buy this person as a pop icon. Perhaps that‚Äôs the point? Maybe Corbet is attempting to make a point about the diminishing musical abilities of pop talents as their stature grows? If so, the point almost feel tangential. Overall, VOX LUX was quite watchable, but it doesn‚Äôt contain nearly as much satirical bite as it thinks it does.
that ending sequence is the best movie moment of the year. also an infinitely better popstar movie than a star is born FIGHT ME
A nasty tantrum of a film, rife with tragedy. Beneath all of its extravagance it makes a statement that's deeply troubling and timely, so much more disturbing than I'd anticipated.
This is felt like a Natalie Portman appreciation movie.
This is definitely not for everyone, but I actually liked it a lot. Sure the relation between gun violence and pop superstardom explored here won't sit well with a lot of people, but I got what the director Brady Corbet was going for even though the relation is not completely fleshed out. Brady's direction is sharp and the visuals were great, even though this movie has problems I see great things from this director. The songs in the movie are okay, only Wrapped Up, Alive, and EKG are worth listening to really. SIA really should've wrote stronger songs because other than those three the songs in this movie were not it. The performances from Natalie Portman, Raffey Cassidy, and Jude Law are great. This is one of Natalie's best performances I've seen from her, though not the best as that's reserved for Black Swan and followed up by Jackie. Natalie was really serving some serious Black Swan vibes, particularly when she was at her show and the red light was hitting her. Natalie really did more choreography during her concert than most of the new pop girls do today. The fact that Celeste really resembled in some aspects the shooter at the start of the movie at the end is a bold statement to make. To say that Celeste herself has turned into a monster by the end has some merit, but to say she and the shooter are the same is crazy. The fact that I did not get to see Natalie Portman sing Wrapped Up fully in this movie is a sin, although the movie did close out with EKG so I can't be that mad because that song is a bop and is a nice song to end the movie on.
"I think I need some new stuff to counteract the old stuff." There's not a lot of new stuff here, but the old stuff works well enough that it doesn't need much counteraction. Yes, teenage girls who get a taste of fame can be recklessly impulsive. Ditto teen stars who grow into young adulthood in the glare of the spotlight. What writer/director Barry Corbet (an actor himself) cannily does is skip over the 16 years in between the filming of Celeste's "Hologram" video (on the same day as the 9/11 attacks) and a copycat terrorist shooting on a Croatian beach that happens to coincide with the kickoff of her comeback concert tour and let the audience catch up and fill in the blanks as best they can.
Jesus fucking christ. So ambitious, absolutely unhinged, and frightening as all hell.¬† First half is a bit tighter than the second (Raffey Cassidy KILLS it) but overall fantastic filmmaking and Natalie Portman‚Äôs terrifying, unconventional performance saves the second half from sagging too much. The ideas are haunting and fascinating, and it‚Äôs smart to offer more questions than answers- no one has any sensible answers for the tragedies we live through day in and out.¬† It doesn‚Äôt completely stick the landing but damn does it stun in its execution. We need more films that are willing to try something this bold.
Vox Lux offers some insightful messages about using pop music as a method of healing from tragedy. But overall, it's overzealous and tries too hard to leave a lasting impact. Read why here (Full review): popculturereviews.com/2018/12/14/vox-lux-review/?fbclid=IwAR2bqtE44xD26syO43l_PUQTSQPcu9OxcwjwmoMQzjzPL1NdSry5cRp6usc
I settled in to a theater with one other person as the light dimmed to what would be one of the strangest, disturbing, and odd-beat films of the year. The darker side of fame and appeal that is relatively unexplored in A Star is Born is what gives this its defining qualities. The sickening, ultraviolent, depiction of pop-stardom separates itself from the musical genres in a macabre fashion. Brady Corbet‚Äôs film works to establish pop-culture and its existence in a world of violence, questioning the connection, if there is any. Right from the visceral and gritty opening prelude, one knows that Corbet is trying to work on establishing Celeste‚Äôs mentality especially in the wake of tragedy, but works to almost show how culture is working to cover up and shed new light on something that spawns out of it, rather than allowing grieving. It truly is a film about maturity, tragedy, coping, and innocence, but Corbet wants to show you how one‚Äôs mentality works when not given the chance to learn how to deal with these topics, and the effects it has.¬† Sia‚Äôs handprint is everywhere in the film, and I‚Äôm quite fine with that. Her records are some of the best pop coming from our FM and internet radios, and her way with lyrics is nearly poetic. These songs feel hastily written, but effective nonetheless as that is what the film tackles with. Pop music is not supposed to make you think, but to make you feel really good. That‚Äôs what Celeste tells the audience in a situation of statuatory boundaries, but the lyrics within the film really work to solidify that idea, which is why the soundtrack is really only worth listening to after the film. Portman‚Äôs singing is fine, but Raffey Cassidy‚Äôs tracks are more fleshed out, signify the change in standards that Celeste‚Äôs career has had to adjust to.¬† Keeping with the discussion of the music, Scott Waller‚Äôs score is effective, bare, and but forgettable by the time we get it the stellar performances throughout the film. It works to provide a state of unease in the film when it needs to, and allows scenes to not fall to awkward silence. The non-diegetic music is simply just that though, meant to exist outside the story for the sake of it being there. Shooting on film works to the advantage of Corbet, as the drab, washed out images really make the performance at the end of the film feel fake, and strange in comparison to the end of the film. The bright colors are clearly not Celeste as a human being but as a persona, and it is a smart nuance with regards to cinematography.¬† This is not completely Portman‚Äôs show (and I‚Äôll admit, she is probably the only reason I saw this movie), as Raffey Cassidy really holds her own, keeping the same dry delivery and performance that she exhibited in Lanthimos‚Äô The Killing of a Sacred Deer. Stacy Martin is great in her smaller role, and the narration by Willem Dafoe was worth noting as well. As much as I think Portman could grab a nomination come Oscar season, I doubt it will happen. One can dream though.¬† The films major fault comes in its editing and story telling. While the themes introduced within the first third are expanded upon in a stellar fashion, the second half slows the tracks, showing a day of Celeste‚Äôs life with no regards to what was set up before. It flips its story on its head in the second and third act, almost jarringly, with no intention of really expanding on what was set up before. It works to it advantage as it is able to both compare and contrast Celeste from the beginning to the end, but it comes at a cost of the story, and the pacing. What was a mildly paced thriller on fame and innocence slows to a strange drama on the acceptance and attitude that fame presents on the psyche of the character. It is almost sloppy, but has the benefit of the film being a character portrait rather than a full story about the fame itself.¬† This will continue to be divisive and ultimately will fall out of the small public conscious it has formed now with the next month or so, but I really think that this film succeeds by mixing visceral and graphic violence, innocence, over sexuality, and how the pop music scene affects culture, even in the face of tragedy. Psychologically, it is gripping to see Celeste grow and change, but it comes at a cost. I highly recommend this, as its gritty take on the story that A Star is Born has continued to tell is both refreshing and outside of the box. Possibly one of my favorites of the year.
Watching Natalie Portman dance on stage in glittery outfits and sing pop music is what initially caught my interested. Thankfully, there is a bit more depth and darkness to Natalie Portman's characters rise to stardom. The dream-like presentation and ethereal atmosphere assist in capturing the viewer full attention during the entire course of the movie. From the opening scene until the ending, the experience of watching the main character exist in their broken state is quite entertaining.
Suggested tag line : A (slightly pretentious and moderately successful) 21st Century Portrait (with potential and a glittery Natalie Portman).
wrapped up was the only good song but go off i guess
Natalie Portman is the baddest bitch in the room.
i mean this in the best way possible... natalie portman gives a tom-hardy-as-venom-esque performance
It‚Äôs only not my worst of the year because I‚Äôm a sucker for creative credits. Got super close to walking out of the theater when Natalie Portman‚Äôs character started pouring out all this ‚Äúwe live in a society‚Äù garbage dialog at her daughter in that god-awful accent. This film is perfect for people whose favorite movie is Enter the Void. I‚Äôll raise it half a star if the point of this film was that I was supposed to hate every second of it.
The opening sequence was really, really good. Every sequence thereafter? Really, really not good. Look, Natalie Portman does a good job, and Raffey Cassidy does an even better job with the material. And yeah, some of the Sia-penned songs are kinda fun. But as a finished product, I found many of the scenes to be tedious and aimless.
I was the only person in my theater‚Äôs screening of Vox Lux, making the experience all the more intimate. I‚Äôm still not entirely sure how I feel about this film, but there are moments in this that left me utterly spellbound. Brady Corbet‚Äôs direction felt incredibly nuanced, and I enjoyed the way he framed his shots and unconventional structure to the film. Natalie Portman was, unsurprisingly, magical. Someone who truly surprised me though was Raffey Cassidy. She‚Äôs such a force to be reckoned with here and her ability to command a scene, both as Celeste and Albertine, is insane. I am so excited to continue to follow her career as an actress. Where the film falls a bit flat for me is in its second act, however. The shift in tone feels abrupt and took me a while to get used to. Additionally, the ending didn‚Äôt hit as hard as I was expecting it to. Nevertheless, this film showcases some of my favorite performances of the year and despite its overall messiness contains several moments of brilliance that will continue to haunt me for days to come. Corbet's approach to the subject matter was genuinely enthralling and although I may never understand the statement he's attempting to make with this "21st Century Portrait", it sure was one hell of a ride. I look forward to revisiting this at some point and seeing if/how my feelings change.
Jesus Christ. I should hate this movie. It's cruel, uncaring, and barely has a third act. However, the filmmaking in this is utterly hypnotic. A 112 minute pop-infused nightmare sent directly from Hell that blew me away. Neon is absolutely insane for giving this a wide release and I'm so glad they did. (Side note: Celeste's music literally sounds like she could be a PC Music artist)
Rating: B+ The filmmaking is bruting. The music is fresh. Natalie Portman is a gift from God. She truly is the best actress in the world right now. This completes the trifecta for her portrait pieces with ‚ÄúBlack Swan‚Äù, ‚ÄúJackie‚Äù, and now ‚ÄúVox Lux‚Äù. She is a powerhouse. And that finale. Woo!
Part social commentary, part satire, but fairly inconclusive - director Brady Colbert's latest trek into obscure territory entitled ‚ÄúVox Lux‚Äù raises questions about fame and notoriety in one of the strangest films of the year. ¬† Split into chapters, with a dry narration from Willem Dafoe - ‚ÄúVox Lux‚Äù charts one popstars insane journey into stardom starting in 1999 and ending in 2017.¬† Full review at TheOnlyCritic.com
YEAH LOL THIS WAS PERFECT NO üß¢¬† Probably Natalie‚Äôs best performance yet, not sure yet though. This film is much more than just a story about a pop star. It‚Äôs a film about a mother, sister, and survivor. The writing really conveys the emotional aspects of these characters and it had me so involved. Brady Corbet really solidifies himself as a real director with this one and I can‚Äôt wait to see what else he does in the future. I‚Äôm really shocked this isn‚Äôt getting more praise than it is. The movie has such a unique directing style that I love so much, the title cards, the narration by Willem Dafoe, etc. it all payed off for me. I can see how some people may be let down by the third act, the movie kinda just ends unexpectedly which may bother some, but I left very satisfied. This was probably my most anticipated film of the year once I saw the trailer and met and even exceeded my expectations. I‚Äôll probably get around to see this one more time before it leaves theaters.
There are two tragedies in life. ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†One is to lose your heart's desire. ¬† The other is to gain it.  Still a great movie that is doing a lot with a lot and I am captivated by almost every minute.
the sound editing was bad for like 50% of this otherwise pretty movie. i wanna throw mad props to my main man lol crowley. nick kroll and john mulaney never should have mocked you at the spirit awards last year
Vox Lux was an experience I wasn't prepared for. It was an interesting take on stardom in the current cuotural climate that in my opinion A Star Is Born (2018) completely missed in it's second half. However, this film was missing the heart and anything that could be considered a satisfying end. The two films I would argue are best seen together, Vox Lux then A Star is Born (2018.) If there is one thing I can say about Vic Lux, it's that I'm still here thinking about it the next day.
A lot of people are gonna hate this, but they‚Äôre wrong. It gave me the same sorts of feelings as watching First Reformed. It may feel ‚Äúpretentious‚Äù but it‚Äôs a lot smarter than that gives it credit for.¬† Also might have the best opening credits sequence ever?
‚ÄòPeople have been bringing me down for yearrrrs‚Äô  The real Star was born. Vox Lux is not what you think. I‚Äôm going to say right now that Natalie Portman was already snubbed of best supporting actress. I have not seen a performance so passionate In YEARS. Every single frame that she is in, you‚Äôre feeling at least 3 different kinds of emotions at once. It is nearly impossible to describe this film. The main things that come to mind are masterful, crude, devastating, and psychedelic. Go and support this IMMEDIATELY.
Haha, this really thinks it's something. Not sure if serious? Mostly had a blast, though.
Natalie did the MOST and I loved it.¬† This movie was ridiculous and I loved it?
one of the few movies I‚Äôve seen this year that truly radiate a single filmmaker‚Äôs vision and passion. I feel like the opening is shocking for the sake of being shocking but after that‚Äôs its pretty smooth sailing. Really makes you think; I might even need to see it again, but I‚Äôm not sure I can stomach a rewatch.
The worst. Tries to tie real world tragedies to pop music and Portman is trying way too hard. Hated this. Almost walked out. Double feature with the far superior Spider-Man: Into the spider verse.
People will hate this because it shoots for something great but manages to only flirt with success. Above all, the precision and form inspire, and I'm thrilled to see where this new voice of cinema takes us. Also...Natalie Portman is a national treasure, how and why is she so good?
hi can someone please tell me why they liked this because i just...i dont get the hype. natalie portman was incredible in it but like...thats it
natalie portman with the best female performance of the year. i said what i said
Loved this film would be five stars except the last 10 mins of Natalie Portman‚Äôs awkward dancing took it down half a star. ¬†But this is a super cool film about terror and celebrity. ¬†Go see this instead of ASIB.
this film has everything, but very rarely does it actually come up with something. I‚Äôm so disappointed with the plot line- what was the point? however, the visuals were absolutely stunning and created a experience almost liminal. it just needs a bit of re-editing and it could be perfection
Stars aren‚Äôt born in "Vox Lux." They‚Äôre baptized in hellfire and draped in silver sequins. Their turbulent personal demons, rebranded as their innate charm, are meant to draw 30,000 to an arena just to see a spectacle unfold. If only there were a show. READ FULL REVIEW ON AZCENTRAL.COM
I literally have no idea how to rate something like this. The AV Club used to have a rating that was "A/F" for content that was perfectly challenging and genre redefining but getting there in ridiculous and sometimes off-putting ways. This feels like that. The opening "Prelude" is vile. If you wanted to walk out of the theater during this sequence, it would be 100% understandable. On the other side of that coin, if the filmmakers want to make the case that shooting that sequence with such realism and putting you in the crosshairs of a school shooting is necessary - in order for you to take the traumatic journey with this character - sure. They can make that case. "Act I" is just fine. "Act II" and "Act III" are phenomenal. Portman only enters the film halfway through but she steals the entire thing. Why do other actors try? Portman is the most transformative actress in history. I have said this before with Jackie, but she‚Äôs an icon. "Finale" for me was the worst bit here. It's necessary in context but I guess it was too drawn out for me.
Just an awful awful awful, deeply mean, cynical film. There's next to nothing to write home about here. The score is exceptional, respect to Scott Walker. Jude Law is very cool and hits a Juul at one point. The film also has a predictably progressive perspective on pop music. That's really it. Everything else is shallow, if not outright embarrassing. Brady Corbet is a film boy who has been patted on the shoulder one too many times, and as a result, feels he has carte blanche to make insensitive, exploitative, and mean-spirited films. His entire career is the result of one too many childhood trips to Europe, where he probably feels "more at home at" or something. I am not a fan of him. I am also incredibly saddened to report that this is easily (re: EASILY) Natalie Portman's worst performance; this is coming from someone who still thinks she should have won for 2016's JACKIE and has been criminally miscast for most of her career. Here, she adopts a shrill and inconsistent Long Island accent while she waxes poetic about phoniness and her failures as a mother. Whatever. I went into this anticipating a trashy pop film, but here I am at 2:30 AM pissed off that this movie was dumb and bad and not fun.
"What the hell do you think that was about?" - One of the three other people at my showing of Vox Lux Wow. All I can say is wow. This film completely floored me. I was expecting A Star is Born, but we got something completely different. Both focus on the life of a pop star, but Vox Lux goes in a completely different direction, one that I wasn't expecting, and one that makes it so much more memorable. Natalie Portman is one of my favorite actresses. I've only seen a few films from her, but from the ones I have seen, she has blown me away every single time. This is no different with Vox Lux, with Celeste being a character unlike anything that I have seen her in before. She may have only been in half of the film, but she was a superstar, just as Celeste was. Every scene was electric with her, especially the final sequence at her concert, which is one of the most stunningly directed scenes of the year from what I've seen. Raffey Cassidy does double duty here, playing young Celeste, as well as her daughter, and does both seamlessly. Some of the film's best moments are in the first act, and Cassidy has some of the best monologues as well. Celeste's character is very relatable at times, and towards the end of the film, becomes somebody that nobody wants to become, creating a very interesting character arc altogether. To say that I was on the edge of my seat during the film would be an understatement. From the film's opening violence, the film is relentless. Similarly to Widows, this film keeps the interest going, even if the film does slow down a lot. Luckily, due to the fantastic performances and gorgeous cinematography, this film stays engaging throughout the entire show. Once I started thinking about what was going on, I started developing unease, especially when entering into the second act. I got a similar sense of anxiety, similar to the feeling of watching Funny Games or The Killing of a Sacred Deer, which ended up inducing a panic attack in the end for me, which was heightened in the final scene. Luckily, once the film was over, I was able to compose myself and am doing better now. Unease flows throughout the film, and you truly never know what is going to happen next. Vox Lux is one of this year's most original concepts, and has some of the strongest performances as well. It's a shame that this film is only being played at two theaters here in Vegas, since it's a film that is going to resonate with many people, even if they can't fully understand adult Celeste's choices. It's a beautifully shot film that actually makes you think about what the film is about, especially with the final narration giving even more food for thought. I may not have a complete idea what the film is about right now, but will be very interested to see how others have interpreted Corbert's vision. I hope to see this film another time on the big screen, since it's the only place that you could fully embrace what Vox Lux has to offer.
I‚Äôd heard that this was controversial in an arthouse sort of way. I don‚Äôt get it. The Snowman¬†was more arthouse.¬† A total mess. A total mess I was feeling for the first act and bored of during the last. Not nearly as unconventional as it thinks.
‚Äúsimply put, it was a hit‚Äù
i‚Äôm surprised that i haven‚Äôt seen much talk about the incredibly gruesome opener this has. probably the hardest thing i‚Äôve had to watch in the theater all year, even worse than anything ‚ÄòMr. Sophistication‚Äô was capable of, or Olga‚Äôs dance in ‚ÄòSuspiria‚Äô.. a beautiful ambitious mess that doesn‚Äôt manage to stick the landing- the first half of the film is great, while the portman half is significantly and glaringly less so. as someone who‚Äôs been in NatPo‚Äôs thrall since ‚ÄòThe Phantom Menace‚Äô, what she‚Äôs doing here is....really Not It. it‚Äôs downright grating, and if you don‚Äôt love her even half as much as me it will probably ruin this for you. maybe its because she plays Celeste at her most sympathetic while portman plays her at her least, but i thought raffey cassidy was much more compelling. still, i very much enjoyed the gimmick of her younger self and her daughter being played by the same actress, with the portman version of celeste operating as this grandiose abomination, totally removed from herself.¬† and¬†as for the actual singing & dancing... think ally maine on SNL
Prelude and First Act are pretty damn good, you‚Äôre pretty much completely broken while also trying to recover a massive comeback I felt the second act was good, but I really didn‚Äôt care for that time leap as I wanted to get to experience Celiste‚Äôs journey to becoming star as it was disappointing, but still manages to be good. The finale for me was underwhelming, you got to scatter your music numbers because if you put it in all in one long act, it gets boring. Best part of that entire finale is DaFoe‚Äôs dialogue which honestly opened my mind with what the writer was going for It‚Äôs a solid movie, with majority of the film be mainly long takes of dialogue so if you can handle that you‚Äôre good to go. Excellent performances across the board
I don't feel well after watching this movie. The first scene establishes that this is a very feel-bad movie.  The camera work was A+ and I absolutely adored whatever film grain effect they used on this. The aspect ratio was an interesting choice as well.  Natalie Portman plays an absolutely despicable character who I somehow felt increadibly sorry for. The irony in that is that I initially went to see this movie knowing absolutely nothing about it, specifically because I like Natalie Portman so much (especially after Black Swan) but ended up leaving the theatre wondering of she had just delivered a performance on par with or possibly even better than that film.  Definately don't go see this if you think it's just an edgy "star is born" though. The movie opens with a graphic depiction of gun violence and it just gets more uncomfortable from there.
The film ends on an ugly and pointless stage performance from Portman‚Äôs character, and the first name in the credits is a dedication to Jonathan Demme.¬† I hope nobody has the gall to call this original while Sean Price Williams is still alive and working.¬† Natalie Portman is flailing. I lost my shit when she tried to pronounce ‚Äúpterodactyl.‚Äù On that note, that diner scene is super long and so are a bunch of other scenes. For what? Where does it take us? It makes scenes feel like showcases for ‚Äúacting‚Äù in lieu of having them actually be directed.¬† Why does the voiceover explain things that I‚Äôve already gleaned from the film three times over?? I had a good time with it. Guys, it‚Äôs bad. But at least I could laugh at it. I cried laughing when 9/11 happened. All of Portman‚Äôs temper tantrums were hilarious. Jude Law owns. The music video/tunnel/motorcycle stuff is gorgeous. Please nobody make cultural criticism/satire through the guise of fiction without giving a shit about your characters. You can make your points without solely using people as ciphers. It‚Äôs possible to just like pop music, too lol wtf @2018.¬† Just please.. never ever make stuff like this.
"Vox Lux" is an ambitious and bombastic exercise in commenting about fame, popstars, and success, and draws parallels of celebrity with terrorism and tragedy. There's a lot of on-the-nose dialogue and situations that scream Corbet's commentary, and he fires his messages rapidly with reckless abandon, never taking the time to flesh out any particular one beyond the surface. I must admit I was less than impressed by Raffey Cassidy's performance in either half and both adult and young Celeste never seemed to come across as remotely the same character. The film is bookended by its two most shocking/entertaining scenes, one involving a shooting and the other being Portman's stage performance. The shooting is executed with violent surprise and impact, while the concert is handled beautifully, with outstanding makeup, lighting, and costumes for Portman. Perhaps by nature the film was made to be just as grandiose and vacuous as one of Celeste's own pop songs, complete with asides and Dafoe's narration, but Corden clearly has things to say about Celeste's rise and perpetual encounters with tragedy; the incorporation of said ideas just comes off as sloppy and unrefined. I won't lie though in saying that regardless of how trying many parts of the film could be, I was intrigued from start to finish. And Portman puts in a worthy enough performance as an unstable diva to warrant a watch. Her stage presence in the climatic finale is an absolute delight. But yea, there was zero reason to have Raffey Cassidy play both young Celeste and Celeste's daughter, while having Stacy Martin's character remain the same.
The first twenty minutes is really good for me. Everything works and we get a great idea of Corbet's style. The movie FALLS apart pretty quickly after that point which is certainly disappointing. I was hoping for it more to be like Haneke but that doesn't seem fair to criticize the movie for something I wish it was. Jude Law is a god though and him struggling to put on his very tiny sunglasses was very good.  DONT JUST COMPARE THIS MOVIE TO STAR IS BORN. IT DOES NOTHING FOR EITHER FILM
terrorism is bad and pop music is, based on this movie, also bad
So like...I was super¬†hyped for this movie and I don‚Äôt even know why. Maybe because Scott Walker was doing the score and I really wanted to hear how that would sound from the guy who made this. Maybe it was because Natalie Portman and Jude Law are great actors and I wanted to see Raffey Cassidy emote, unlike in Killing of a Sacred Deer. I couldn‚Äôt give a reason, but this was probably one of my most anticipated movies this season and I felt super weird about it.¬† I don‚Äôt really want to say anything more than I have to about the opening scene, but it felt very real. And it was, uh, a lot. It may well be the most disturbing thing I‚Äôve ever watched. Thus began a 110-minute odyssey of complex emotion, the ramifications of people changing, and the blurred lines between good and bad intentions. It‚Äôs a movie that continually throws up little red flags, again and again, and ends on a fever pitch. The more I think about it the more I think this may be my favorite movie of the year, but that doesn‚Äôt change the fact that this is a difficult film that rewards patience and analysis with an enthralling character study rooted in modern culture.¬† This movie, like its central character, has so many emotions that can change from moment to moment but there‚Äôs something real and honest about all of them. At times funny, tragic, scary, and uplifting, this movie just hops from little moment to little moment, but every revelation feels important and powerful. This is a very crafted film, the kind refined from deep meditation on what it‚Äôs trying to say and how it wants to go about that, and by the end it‚Äôs definitely made it‚Äôs point.¬† I don‚Äôt even want to say I recommend this movie because it‚Äôs a lot to stomach and, honestly, wholly unenjoyable. With that said, this is an amazing artistic achievement that may capture American pop culture more than anything else I‚Äôve ever seen, and even if I never watch it again (which seems unlikely) I will buy it and I will not forget it.
A messy movie for messy times.¬† Vox Lux¬†probably bites off more than it can chew, but its aftertaste is unforgettable, if not extremely bitter. This is a movie about everything and nothing, that‚Äôs point is there is no point. It‚Äôs a reverse Trojan horse, where the twist ends up not being what‚Äôs hiding under the surface, but what‚Äôs hiding in plain sight.¬† Vox Lux suggests our problem isn‚Äôt that we‚Äôve forgotten what the horrors of modern life look like, but that we‚Äôve become so numb to them, they might as well all be window dressing.
Sue me! I loved it!
Could have been great and often times VOX LUX gets really close; this is probably the most conflicting movie of the year for me.¬† Spanning about 20 years, the film is split into three very different acts. The presentation of the entrances and exits‚Äîthrough text, narration (an omniscient and foreboding Willem Dafoe), interstitial scenes‚Äîwas one of the most exciting aspects of the film. The beginning and end credits are especially well done.¬† Unfortunately, the exciting aspects of the film is followed by relatively uninteresting directing in most scenes‚Äîthe production design is often impressive but Corbet never seems to be in command with his shot selection. The events of the film are often wild and crazy but the formal presentation seldom gets close to the same level‚ÄîI found the camera to not be subjective enough. This may have been intentional so that Corbet could provide an unaffected look at Celeste but I think this approach gives prominence to the artifice in a way that is distracting.¬† I could never pinpoint if Portman‚Äôs performance was too on the nose or over the top‚Äîher accent was especially distracting. I gave her, being the incredible actress that she is, the benefit of the doubt. Looking back on it now, I think it is a very good performance, the scene before the finale is great acting and relieved most grievances I had earlier on in the film. That being said, I don‚Äôt think I would have been in disbelief in the first place if Corbet‚Äôs direction were more daring in dialogue scenes‚ÄîI think that about sums up my feelings towards the film as a whole; all the parts that you could feel Corbet‚Äôs presence were great. There were moments where it feels that the supernatural (the subjectivity of Corbet) is in play and then the rest seems like a documentary which was disappointing.¬† The film is at its best when there is presentation of text on screen, Willem Dafoe‚Äôs poetic and strange narration, and especially the non-diegetic score which I was floored to find out in the opening credits was composed by Scott Walker (one of my favorite musicians, mostly because his songs and arrangements are so dissonant and cinematic). As a Sia fan, I found the songs to be rather lackluster (not bad but none of the songs pack a punch) but whenever the score came in I was riveted‚Äîthere is jarring editing and imagery that just pulls you in but eventually lets you go once you get back to the story. I couldn‚Äôt get enough of those types of moments.¬† Corbet dedicates the film to Jonathan Demme at the end which is strange because during the live performance I was hoping to see something more akin to Demme‚Äôs direction‚Äîunfortunately, Corbet‚Äôs direction is probably more akin to Singer‚Äôs in BOHEMIAN RHAPSODY than Demme in STOP MAKING SENSE. That was one of the things I found myself doing during this film: imagining what another director would do with the great concept. If Lars Von Trier directed this film it would probably be my favorite of the year. Alternatively, I found myself thinking about what Josephine Decker (MADELINE‚ÄôS MADELINE) would have done with this material.¬† Anyways, I really love the thematic material Corbet touches on, I love the character, the spectacle‚Äîthe conceptual framework of this movie is something I am extremely interested in and I think it is incredibly relevant material. The reason I say so much (sorry for rambling) about it is because of how close it gets to being something spectacular. Unfortunately though, VOX LUX falls short more than it sticks the landing.  P.S. Jude Law is daddy (we stan a legend)
I can‚Äôt stop thinking about when I was around 7 I said my favorite actress was Natalie Portman and that still holds up to this day. she‚Äôs too powerful .... and i can‚Äôt stop thinking about this film.
Big thanks to the guy in front of me who was Shazaming songs near the end of the film.
I was dazed. The film starts in an insane and awful place and my blood quite literally ran cold and I shivered. And then, in a sick way I got excited. Because I haven‚Äôt kept up with this film so I don‚Äôt know how heavily advertised it is, but this film does not start anywhere close to where I thought it would. It starts in a hellhole. With Willem Dafoe narrating. And it clashes together different filmmaking styles and soundscapes and editing techniques and decided almost period acting choices that pair well with some of the almost period music cues. And it‚Äôs a whirlwind of barely controlled chaos. But it is controlled. By a skillful conductor at the eye of the storm in Brady Corbet. And what he creates is mesmerizing. As is Raffey Cassidy who bizarrely but impressively and skillfully plays both young Celeste and Celeste‚Äôs Daughter in the two halves of the story. And Stacy Martin, who plays her sister Eleanor in both halves. And then Natalie Portman plays Celeste in Part 2. With Jude Law as the Manager in both parts. ¬† It‚Äôs insanely disorienting but only by design. You never get a second to catch your breath except in the long take, disgustingly uncomfortable and intimate conversational scenes between characters. You never get to sit and process because Celeste never gets to as the film takes on an unholy journey through her rapid ascension. And truthfully, THIS is the film that feels most most accurate and brutally honest in its portrayal of the American Dream and what it costs to take it. What it means to pursue it. What a Star requires to be born. This is a film that scares and I don‚Äôt want to talk to specifically about it because I know I have to see it again and that bone jarring opening is still with me....and I don‚Äôt want to give away anything in this awful awful brilliantly conceived film as I clumsily explore it. But this is something special. Something different. Something true. There‚Äôs a voice here. There‚Äôs a story here. It‚Äôs told in a way I never would have expected. It‚Äôs a kaleidoscope of feeling and memory. It feels like if A Star is Born was directed by Nicholas Winding Refn taking cues from 20th Century Women. I know how that sounds. It‚Äôs something to see. Corbet makes bold choices editorially and they really paid off for me. They won‚Äôt for many. It‚Äôs a specific film. But it‚Äôs to be cherished and seen and thought about.
112-minute long anxiety attack.¬†  Natalie Portman is a marvel.
you ever see a film so good and so accurate and everything is so perfect you can‚Äôt form words in an articulate way? yeah that‚Äôs me right now!
Very scattered thoughts because I still can‚Äôt decide how I feel about this one. I didn‚Äôt hate it overall, but I can‚Äôt even really focus on what I enjoyed. First off, I¬†have NEVER in my life seen a movie try so hard to be profound, and fail so miserably. Would be absolutely unwatchable without Natalie Portman and Jude Law. Raffey Cassidy needs to hire a new dialect coach and learn how to enunciate because I can barely understand anything she says. The film tries to do so much, but just comes across as flat and disingenuous. MAYBE I‚Äôm being too harsh because I can‚Äôt get past my initial disappointment. The connection between terrorism and pop music is so fucking hamfisted. The screenplay needed a complete overhaul. Also, I‚Äôve never seen a film so beautifully shot and so abysmally edited. What‚Äôs his face needs to go to film school.
Natalie should really stick to rapping.
Everyone sees something else when they look at me like I‚Äôm not real like I‚Äôm a character in a movie he‚Äôs telling me that he‚Äôs forgotten me like it means nothing like it all means nothing three years of utter nothingness
So I missed the school shooting scene as I came into the cinema as soon as the opening credits started rolling, but I‚Äôm sure that didn‚Äôt take away from the raw beauty and relentless truth of this film. Natalie‚Äôs performance is one of the best of the year, and is definitely worthy of an Oscar nomination. I also adored the final concert performance. The film‚Äôs themes on gun violence, and addiction (!!!), were portrayed extremely well. Literally A Star Is Born but with Columbine.
Natalie Portman was great but I just don‚Äôt really care for the rest of the film. The opening sequence was starteling but what would follow just didnt continue the edge that we are first shown.  2018 Ranked
Temporarily lifting my ban on Using The Word ‚ÄúPretentious‚Äù To Describe A Movie for this very special exception, which I quite enjoyed most of!
It looks great! I mean in a literal sense: the visuals in this were absolutely incredible, and my favorite part of the film. I also mean this in the sense that it sounds like a great concept: Natalie Portman as a broken pop star haunted by her trauma. I actually was super excited for this, but ultimately it just wasn't for me. I was surprised when Portman didn't show up until about halfway through. We were left with Raffey Cassidy (who I loved in last year's The Killing of a Sacred Deer) but I thought that there could've been a little more emotion in her performance. Her character does a lot of big things and I didn't really feel sold on a lot of her acting. I wish this movie was a little longer and perhaps done a bit of a higher budget so they wouldn't constantly gloss over interesting plot points with the narration (read very nicely by Willem Dafoe). The second half was a lot better than the first for me, mostly because of the addition of Portman's beautifully strange performance and her ??? accent. The concert scene looks absolutely amazing, but (this might be just me) the song's aren't very good? I was surprised I wasn't into them because they were written by Sia and I'm usually into her music, but the song's (both in the ones sung by Cassidy and Portman) don't sound very good to me. There's a couple stylistic choices that kinda felt a little annoying. I know I'm not the one to judge what a director finds to be a good choice for their film stylistically, but i think the decision to constantly speed things up in montage looked really strange (in a not so good way). That's really the only negative I have regarding how the film looked. The opening scene was very disturbing and probably my favorite part of the film. It's very disturbing and I think it presents the trauma Celeste, the film's protagonist goes through. If there's one thing some of the first scenes in the film, and the first half in general do well, is establish an interesting relationship between Celeste and her older sister. It definitely could have been more fleshed out, but it was one of the more interesting aspects of a film. I find the thesis of this story very interesting: how trauma can shape a modern pop musician. I just wish that it was explored a little differently so see how young Celeste morphed into older Celeste, because the two seem to be very different characters. I'm upset I didn't like this more. I love Portman and I thought the trailer was incredible. Maybe I'll like it more on a second watch
Amazing movie.¬† In my opinion Natalie Portman is one of the best if not THE best actress of all time. She makes you believe in every character she portrays - even as a kid she was totally stellar in every role she took on.¬† This movie is excellent and has a ton of hidden meaning! It‚Äôs moving as well
just so everyone knows this is the best film of the year. thank you and goodnight.
..... Lemme just say that Natalie Portman is absolutely phenomenal in this and Willem Dafoe narrating this was just bone chilling. The last 20 minutes felt like I was in a real concert, this whole movie is wild and keeps you entertained for the whole 2 hours. Aight bye
This film was magnificent. I really hate reading lengthy reviews so I‚Äôll try to keep this as short as possible but essentially this film is about how the character Celeste (Natalie Portman) rises to become a star from a tragedy that happens to her as an adolescent.¬† Through the entire film I was comepletely in awe by how well directed it was , the stunning visuals, the score, and the performances.¬† But what REALLY stood out was how well Natalie Portman played her part. Though I‚Äôm not surprised at all by her impressive performance in this, it is still incredible to see her in her element.
Brady Corbet is an extremely talented filmmaker and has a lot to say in this film, Natalie Portman has never been better and that is saying something.
i don‚Äôt think this is going to work for everyone but its exploration of fame arising from the aftermath of trauma alongside the trauma from said fame i found riveting to watch. the film doesn‚Äôt try to apologize for celeste‚Äôs many faults or glorify aspects of her life that are pretty fucked up. the tagline of this being a portrait is so appropriate‚Äîit presents celeste as she is. the narrator, when he does have something to say, is documentary-like in his delivery. it‚Äôs not asking for a value judgment.¬† also: the use of raffey cassidy in the second half of the film was such a fantastic choice. the depth it added to those scenes is just [chef‚Äôs kiss]
Woof. Ok, imagine A Star is Born¬†but it‚Äôs instead about Ray of Light-era Madonna who‚Äôs a survivor of Columbine for some reason that ties two more terrorist attacks into her life as a substance-abusing deadbeat. That‚Äôs it, that‚Äôs literally the movie. Oh and it‚Äôs a tribute to Jonathan Demme despite it having really lame live concert footage. Natalie is magnetic in this, she deserves GOAT status in the current state of her career. But this was just too bizarre to recommend or ever see again. I‚Äôm glad I saw it and was fascinated by how far it goes in certain aspects, but I‚Äôm not sure what it was going for in the end.
I‚Äôm at a loss of words so lemme just say that the first 10 minutes sank my heart into pure oblivion. I was shocked, polarized, disturbed, and taken 1000000% off guard by what the fuck this movie was going to entail. Might be some of the scariest and downright disturbing shit I have seen in a movie all year and I sat through Hereditary twice. More to come. Maybe. Idk. Give Natalie Portman and Raffey Cassidy the fucking Oscars already. Vox Lux fuxed with my head.
It‚Äôs so easy to read into this character, and that‚Äôs what sells this movie. Natalie Portman is great as expected, but so is the actress playing her young self, which came as a nice surprise. Certain aspects of this movie were very disturbing and unique, even though the plot‚Äôs trajectory is something we‚Äôve seen many times before. I would recommend this one for sure.
This was such an interesting watching experience. The beginning promised greatness. The middle promised me lightness. The end promised nothing. In fact, it took back those promises and said YEET. What a weird film.
I'm not entirely sure of what Brady Corbet is doing here, but I'm pretty sure that he is mostly sure of what he's doing, and the people he's got on board with him seem sure enough about what he's convinced them that he is totally and undeniably sure of. Does that make sense? Kind of, right? That's the movie. Despite its touch-and-go unevenness, I'd be lying if I said I wasn't a sucker for some pretty-looking artbait about popstars that don't give a fuck and tragedies on the world stage and the certainty of having angles and unique arty visual sequences and Jude Law lurking in the shadows and some good music to boot Do I sound negative? I can't tell. That's not what I'm getting at, if I do sound that way. While it wasn't without its problematic technical and structural choices, I really enjoyed this film, which is more than I can say for the rest of the (mostly older) crowd at Philadelphia's Ritz East Theater, one of which stood up at the end and loudly proclaimed to his wife "This was even worse than First Reformed," so any chance of a friendship there is absolutely ruined. I digress. I'll be thinking about this one for a while and, really, isn't that one of the better things a film can do for you?

a star is born but for crackheads???
This is an absolute MESS. And I really loved it. Natalie is amazing, and it‚Äôs definitely ambitious. It‚Äôs such a great concept but I wish it was made by a better filmmaker!!  It‚Äôs such a heartbreaking exploration into how violence shapes us and how we try to make sense out of senseless violence. That ending really made me mad though lmao like what?
i keep seeing reviews and articles about how awful and unlikeable celeste is... and i have to say i really don‚Äôt get it. she survived a tragedy and was almost immediately launched into international stardom, and like anyone whose had to grow up too fast, she‚Äôs a little emotionally stunted from these two cataclysmic life events.¬† she‚Äôs not more unlikeable than a walter white/don draper type (which is painfully cliche to use as a comparison at this point, i know) and she‚Äôs a much more interesting music figure than ally or jackson maine in a star is born (another futile comparison as the two films couldn‚Äôt be more different). so the hate is a bit much of you ask me.¬† natalie portman and raffey cassidy knock it out of the park. also raffey and stacy martin playing sisters is something i didn‚Äôt know i needed?? the cast was really strong
Modernity is born from the destruction of tradition through tragedy. And Vox Lux explores this idea through the rise and decay of the ‚Äúcelebrity‚Äù in an almost anti-art art film. It doesn‚Äôt always show exactly what it means, just like Portman‚Äôs character, but it doesn‚Äôt have to. Is a highly scrutinized fame on par with murderoys infamy? Brady Corbet is not here to answer these questions, but to simply ask them at the most inopportune, uncomfortable, but perhaps equally most important time.
First five or so minutes of this film shocked the hell out of me and yet held for the movie this gritty and washed out aesthetic and vibe of the rest to come, much like the characters' evolutions, especially towards the end. +100 points for Sia's music and dope costumes as well.
This is what happens when you let film bros make movies. So bombastic it can‚Äôt even show establishing shots of New York City without intrusive percussion and overwhelming music. Brady Crobet just turned 30 this year. But this is a movie very much still steeped in the sensibilities of a 20-something cinephile. You know, the kind of guy whose highest praise for a film is that it is a ‚Äúfucking masterpiece.‚Äù Crobet is clearly trying to make his ‚Äúfucking masterpiece‚Äù with Vox Lux. I can imagine him being raised on a lot of the indie and foreign hits of the 2000s. He seems to respond strongly to that specific fusion of dizzying camerawork, dense montage, and aforementioned overwhelming music. He tops it off by adding some cultural commentary for the film bros to dissect in predictable ways online afterwards in order to complete their ‚Äúfucking masterpiece‚Äù experience. But it‚Äôs all pretty bad and boring. Honestly, who would have thought watching someone else strive so hard for intensity and emotion in every stylistic choice could be so dull?
Its strength is clearly in its first half, but even the shift to a cynical pop star with a questionable accent can't quite derail the sporadically powerful commentary on the tenuous connection between fame and infamy.
A strange portrait that is both obvious and confusing, thematically resonant and idiotic. It isn't exactly the movie I wanted, but it's hard to think of a movie that better captures the time we live in. One where the culture is dominated by violence and the media's desperate need to churn our suffering into cash, to create heroes from ordinary people, leaving the people ruined. We suck but we are also kind of beautiful and so is this movie, I guess. Like the narrator of this film, it's sort of a Van Gogh, perhaps better appreciated after its time as a cult classic. For now though, watching this film is painful and funny not only because it sometimes falls into parody but because more often than not, it doesn't.
‚ÄúA 21st Century Portrait‚Äù is how director Bryan Corbet subtitles his sophomoric effort, ‚ÄúVox Lux.‚Äù I can think of a handful of films that are far more deserving of this subtitle, some of which I even saw this year: films such as ‚ÄúSorry to Bother You,‚Äù Boots Riley‚Äôs surreal and phantasmagoric exploration of racism and class struggle and ‚ÄúMinding the Gap,‚Äù Bing Liu‚Äôs sympathetic portrait of youth, parenthood, and making ends meet in Middle America. Heck, given the recent revelations of Facebook‚Äôs relationship with Cambridge Analytica, how the latter harvested data from millions of users without their consent and how Facebook hired a lobbying firm to silence its critics, David Fincher‚Äôs and Aaron Sorkin‚Äôs ‚ÄúThe Social Network‚Äù (2010) is THE ‚Äú21st Century Portrait‚Äù par excellence. That‚Äôs not to say that ‚ÄúVox Lux‚Äù is lacking in ideas, it‚Äôs just that Corbet doesn‚Äôt know what to do with them; he opts to throw everything against the wall to see what sticks, instead of thinking things through.

What a weird movie. It‚Äôs filmmaking style is very strange. Also super depressing. There‚Äôs some pretty visceral violence that I wasn‚Äôt expecting going into this. While I‚Äôm not usually sensitive to violence in films, this just caught me off guard and felt a little too real. I can certainly appreciate this movie‚Äôs commitment to its style. It was exectuted in a odd way but props to them for not holding back on it. Probably the only movie I‚Äôve seen where the credits roll at the beginning. Interesting experiment but they‚Äôre rolling like over the movie so it‚Äôs a bit distracting.¬† Natalie Portman and Jude Law really shine. They‚Äôre so committed to their characters and they have really great chemistry on screen. I was also impressed with the actress that played young Natalie Portman. Her Portman impression is really great.¬† Story-wise, it‚Äôs got some really great themes. Familiar themes, but it tells the story well enough. I was unaware going in that Sia wrote the music, but you can definitely tell it‚Äôs her writing once you hear it. Overall a well told, if depressing, story with an off putting execution and good themes. But if you‚Äôre looking for something a bit more uplifting I‚Äôd go for Bohemian Rhapsody or A Star Is Born.
And The Devil made her repeat, This is ten percent luck Twenty percent skill Fifteen percent concentrated power of will Five percent pleasure Fifty percent pain And a hundred percent reason to remember the name
Arresting, if flawed, vehicle for Natalie Portman to shine. Gorgeous cinematography, set up, editing, soundtrack and tonal work here.
Laughably pretentious*. Literally laugh-out-loud pretentious, numerous times. Fun seeing this with a crowd. Thought I was in the wrong theater/movie for roughly ten minutes. Startlingly dark in places, including certain scenes straight out of a Bret Easton Ellis adaptation.¬† BUT...certainly far from boring or bland, and not least of all due to some excellent lead performances. Loved Portman, loved Law**. Portman‚Äôs half of the film was more enjoyable than the front half. Top two scenes: 1. Interview scene, featuring Christopher Abbott. 2. Diner scene, featuring wine-in-a-cup. Brady Corbet has gotta be insufferable. I would call his directing style, ‚Äúfilm school troll.‚Äù Would love an interview with the editor about how easy this job was. *See: both the opening and closing credits choices. **Do we think Jude Law is upset that Jennifer Lawrence was given the ‚ÄúJ. Law‚Äù moniker?
This movie is a lot.
As much about how an audience needs a star as it is about how a star needs her audience. "My little angels," Celeste says on stage, living for the applause of her fans, the people who keep her going even as she slides into the oddities and mediocrities of a new realm of pop. The years keep going by and she's still the same demanding, insecure young woman who is unsure of her identity, simply spouting what the devil himself has whispered in her ear. She'll never die, no matter what she says or does though. She's Faust, but she's got soul. Her soul lives on in the music, in the personas she puts on, in the words she writes and the music her sister provides her, in the jobs she continues to supply to everyone who puts on a show, who makes an album, who helps create this icon. Pop isn't as surface level as we know it; there's so much going on in the background, trauma able to show up at any moment, but at the end of the day, the show must go on. And so it does, not with a bang, but with the same flourishes and movements and style as every other icon, as every other concert. And though we've seen it before, and Celeste exists as an icon we all know (formed from the ashes of a number of identities), she may not matter to us, but she matters to her fans - from the teen crying that she's at a Celeste show (knowing this will be one of the best nights of her life) to the sister and daughter who are along for the ride, knowing in their heart that, at the very least, in this one moment, this woman know to be a deeply damaged mess is nothing but sincere in what she's presenting on that stage. Music is as much of a damnation as it is a salvation.
I started enjoying this movie about 40 minutes in when I decided it was a comedy. I laughed my ass off at it. If that wasn't the point, then it completely missed (I'm leaning in this direction). Every time Willem Dafoe's narration kicked in, it was comic genius. And her "show" at the end was Spinal Tap levels of awful. And the score with its foreboding chords before nothing bad happens. Very possibly the worst movie of 2018.
Bodies fall and the credits roll. The story is over before it's even been told. Jude Law shines. Everyone else shines too. The final concert plays and your head is so full of incoherent contradictions and all you want to do is be in the crowd, it looks so nice, it looks right, and maybe it is.
A girl in the wake of tragedy pushing forward the only way she knows how, the only way possible. Singing for others but still reminding them that she is God. A selfless act made to distract others from their own tragedies, our collective tragedy. A self serving act made solely to keep you alive. Inherent contradictions and confused values all bouncing around in the same mind concluding with certainty that we would all truly be fucked if it weren't for all this music. If the Devil is real he's what we deserve but even more alarmingly he's what we need. We don't have any solutions but we can sing and we can turn blind eyes and we can dance with the crowd; all of which are equally valid responses to the eternal state of grief we find ourselves in. And it's only good because if it wasn't we'd all be dead. And if we were all dead then we wouldn't have a chance to hear the music.
This thing really squanders any and all good will!!!
Me dancing along to Natalie Portman and stanning this mess! media.giphy.com/media/j7c8Gcxet30Iw/giphy.gif
I liked this! I think that Childhood of a Leader is probably my personal preference of Bradley Corbet's movies but I definitely applaud the guy BIG TIME for making movies like this. I think his movies are thought provoking and great!
everything about this was awful. Only gets 1 star because the SIA songs were jammin.
Natalie Portman is a showstopper in this tale of terrorism and triumph in the face of an affected world. Although the film has its brush with glorious narration from Willem Dafoe, too often Brady Corbet‚Äôs direction feels inauthentic and mannered, like Diet Lars Von Trier- eager to let us in on the horror and grit but too aware of how it will get us there pace by pace. Outside of the narration, the scripting also struggles to detail what it finds so important about this journey as well. Using art as a catalyst for exploring suffering isn‚Äôt anything new- luckily Portman‚Äôs insanity as older, questionably wiser Celeste is enough of a jolt to anchor the film to its pop finale. If only the rest of the production was on her level.
what an ugly mess. why did a man direct this
