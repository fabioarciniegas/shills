Magnus, you are so great!!
Magnus Carlson is a chess prodigy and the current world champion. I most definitely don't understand the ranking system, but Magnus is listed as the highest ranking chess player of all time: en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_chess_players_by_peak_FIDE_rating. This documentary is fantastic. It starts with home movies of a young Magnus. He's, um, a little different. (ha) And then it continues on to track Magnus' life playing chess as a teenager and then an adult. The analysis of Magnus' approach to chess is really interesting. He's different. He does less rote computer analysis than most players and focuses on a more global, intuitive approach. Also, Magnus is both remote/weird and personable at the same time. We see him distracted and absorbed in thought, but the movie also shows him having fun with his family. It's a wonderful contrast. The ending/crescendo is Magnus' first attempt to win the world chess title. The movie is only 75 minutes long, and it's riveting. Great movie! QOTD That's the most impressive thing I've ever seen. - girl watching Magnus play blind chess at Harvard (and williamt) One of the highlights of the movie is Magnus playing chess against 10 Harvard lawyers simultaneously... while blindfolded! After winning each match, he signs the chess board for each player, except one. One guy asks if Magnus can write down each move of their game on a piece of paper and sign it. So Magnus does it effortlessly, surrounded by a disbelieving group of onlookers. It was breathtaking and absolutely one of the most impressive things I've ever seen as well. Great movie. 5 bill-stars! yow, bill
They don't show any chess
Pretty good documentary, not super technical or detailed, but gives a good overview of Carlsen's journey up until now. Probably best suited for those who may not be familiar with chess, but still watchable for those who are familiar with the game.
Smiled all the way through
When you have children you have certain expectations. Not sharing is usually easier than sharing.
They do well to make chess entertaining as well as interesting and to cover the ground in less than 80 minutes
I fucking love chess and I’m also weirdly attracted to Magnus Carlsen
holy shit this kid’s brain works on an entirely different level from the rest of ours. the movie created a very conventional narrative but like this is mindblowing
Him playing blind at Harvard and memorizing five or more games at once was astonishing?
Truly heartwarming.
Interesting, but wanted more about his training and less about his rock and roll life style.
An inoffensive little doc about the rise of the best player in the world. I’d have appreciated more discussion of Magnus’s playing style. Has inspired me to study more seriously so that’s something.
Hour 15 is a pretty light documentary considering that most of the footage is split between childhood and his first championship. Pacing works and it's a pretty clean documentary overall. Nothing to write home about on a technical level, but it's interesting to see the growth of a bonafide genius at a pivotal moment in his life.
Magnus’ mind is a heck of a subject, but this documentary barely even scratches the surface. To be fair, I’m not sure anyone could get through that impenetrable fortress. But the film is really more about his rise to becoming world champion and the psychological pressure that puts on a mind, especially a teenager’s. What is the personal cost of being a world-class mind in such a formative time in life as your teenage years? How does one cope with introversion and social alienation while simultaneously being burdened with possibly the highest-stakes intellectual contest in the world? How do you continue to perform at a high level when your intuition fails you? And which is the greater intelligence: the ability to memorize all known possible outcomes, or the ability to intuit and create new solutions? I suspect you will not find the answers to those questions here, although the film does certainly raise the questions, which isn’t nothing. It focuses on the journey to world champion narrative more than the champion himself, but it’s nonetheless an engaging story even if it’ll probably only appeal to a niche audience.
Impressive, yet intimidating enough to make me feel like a failure of a chess player.
Very enjoyable documentary that tells a story about raising a child who is different in many ways and using a family to help the child succeed without making demands.
The World Champion is 26 years old, so no wonder this behind-the-scenes documentary runs only 76 minutes. Where's the fire?
A child prodigy story that borders on both the genius as well as the imperfections and struggles of an individual determined to reach his goal. Highly riveting towards the end... makes you want to play that common game of chess!
He wins.
An interesting profile for the uninitiated, but in its cursory understanding of chess, it makes little effort to understand Magnus’s genius, which remains enigmatic as ever. While Magnus the man has had an outsize role in inspiring a new generation of young chess players, Magnus the film fails to depict the game as anything but arcane.

Fascinating story, decently shot. No frills.
excellent documentary...very likable dude. and what an ass that Indian guy comes off as with all of his computers. good villain.
Watching high performing individuals at the top of their game is always an inspiring pleasure. They could be perfectionist sushi chefs, sommeliers or chess prodigies like Magnus Carlsen.
Cool documentary. Well shot. Nothing groundbreaking but I find the subject of high level chess and genius fascinating.
Enjoyable enough story, but doesn't do a great job of explaining what makes his style of chess so good. You simply have to accept the judgments of experts who say things like "he's the Mozart of Chess!" The movie mostly sets up a narrative where Magnus' biggest enemy is his own tendency to crack under pressure, so that the best thing he can do is find ways to relax. They also argue (briefly) he relies on intuition rather than rote memory of good positions. Easy to understand for an outsider like me, but not particularly illuminating.   I learned more about Magnus' style of chess from reading for 15 min online than I did from the film. Magnus has phenomenal stamina. He has an ability to choose unconventional positions with many possibilities for mistakes by his opponents, and then capitalizes on those errors. He himself plays with very few flaws...
It could use 10 -15 more minutes because the bast parts play over the credits. Perhaps it is better if you go into to it knowing nothing about Magnus beforehand.
Who is he? A ghost in his own right. There only in instances And the happenstance of folly. Glory be not that which is praised. Whose kingdom a mall And his crown strung with grease. Whose army will vanquish In the blink of an eye. The mob befuddled. For everything they know Is trampled and defied. And the mob grows angry At his utter lack of care. Who is he? A ghost in his own right. There only in instances And the happenstance of folly. Glory be not that which is praised.  imgur.com/a/zem6K
Good look at a singular mind that has become the best chess player ever. It's surface level stuff mainly, but overall is pretty interesting.
Sadly revealing, that for being a world champion in chess you need to have no other life - and therefore there isn't that much interesting background info about a person without a background. And his father seems to be really pushing...
If Forrest Gump was Norwegian, middle class, and played chess instead of ping pong. I always wanted to learn to play chess, so I find it fascinating. This film could have done more to delve into Magnus as a person, but instead thickens the cloud of mystery already surrounding him.
An inspiring and magnificent documentary about Magnus Carlsen - the best chess player of our time.
yea, pretty good i guess.
This was an inspirational and feel good documentary, albeit a very superficial and cursory one. What impressed me the most was Magnus's luck in having a father who recognized and nurtured his talent from a young age and a close, loving, supportive family. The documentary briefly touched on Magnus's negative experience at school and I wanted to see more along those lines, as well as a deeper examination of his unique talent and mind. The blindfolded chess match against ten masters at the same time was unbelievable.
Magnus is a fascinating documentary which uses unprecedented access to paint a compelling portrait of a fascinating character and undoubted genius. www.backseatmafia.com/film-review-magnus/
king of chess -- but unfortunately this documentary was too surface-level. it DID pique my curiosity, but i finished the film with more questions than answers
A subject as fascinating as Carlsen and a canvas as infinitely rich as chess wasted on an average, linear, generic portrayal. The boy genius shows early prowess, gets the jitters, eventually triumphs. The end. Seeing family footage of young Carlsen is fun to a point, but as a documentary, this has all the insight and depth of a corporate first-day training video and as much tension between different perspectives as a mom's narration over of a photo album. I don't see why anyone who does not play chess would get into it after seeing this movie and I don't see what a chess person would get from it. Enjoy his cameo on the Simpsons instead: www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZiPeqXKC3Y
Like Dancer, this is a fascinating portrait of someone doing what it seems they were born to do. I know little about chess but really this is more of a character study with chess as the focus. This is made in such a way that I feel anyone would find it interesting regardless of their knowledge of competitive chess.
Magnus Carlsen is my favorite contemporary chess player so I went into this doc already primed to like it. What I didn't expect was such a warm portrait of the world champion. Unfortunately, it was at the cost of any details about Magnus the chess player (like, what he does that makes him so good). The final match featured here against Viswanathan Anand framed everything the filmmakers were going for: man vs machine. Computer prep vs. "just playing chess." Using voiceovers from his father to fill in details of his biography, the film tells the story of a boy who kept to himself, tenderly doting on matters of thought until one day he conquered his self-doubt and just played chess. It is a reasonable story (though maybe a little problematic with the way it sketched out Anand) and told in a clean and very well structured manner. The result is a tense match between Anand and Carlsen. It also meant there is no mention of the game they are actually playing beyond phrases like, "he's the Mozart of chess" or my favorite "it is like climbing mount Everest in tennis shoes with no oxygen -- impossible, and yet, here he is doing it." I'm not sure why filmmakers (and people generally) like movies about chess despite the fact that these movies usually avoid chess altogether. Take the awful AWFUL Pawn Sacrifice by Edward Zwick... Fischer/Spassky game 6 is featured (one of the most beautiful games in the history of chess) and yet, nothing of the game is conveyed. A viewer unfamiliar with the game wouldn't even know the opening used (or that chess has an opening at all). The same is true in this documentary. I can't fault a film for not including something it never intended to include, and for the casual viewer I think the film does an excellent job of filling out just who Magnus Carlsen is as a person and what he has accomplished. That said, I really wish we could get a film that found a way to feature the actual game of chess itself in an accessible way. Searching for Bobby Fischer did a pretty solid job of that - the climactic match in that film was fantastic. Magnus seems like a really nice guy and it's really easy to root for him to win all the things but if you dig a little deeper and get a chance to see what he actually does as a chess player you will find a larger picture of the man -- aggressive, creative, and able to win with just the slightest toehold of an advantage.
Good documentary just imagine being the greatest at anything in the world 🌎 and chess of all things Amazing mind..
Watchable but conventional bio-doc about chess champion Magnus Carlsen. I watched because I've been very interested in competitive chess recently (more specifically, the stories behind the great players), but I don't feel I've gotten to know Magnus too well, or understand his importance; it's not intimate or nuanced enough for that, sticking mainly to light hagiography. A lot of the editing feels like a missed opportunity, especially the scene showing that, during his 2013 world championship bout against Viswanathan Anand, Magnus was almost late for a match - and therefore almost disqualified. Rushed and anticlimactic, the scene feels manufactured to create false drama, but could've packed more of a punch had it better explored why Magnus was running late, and the significance of that moment. Also mostly fails to make the actual chess scenes interesting; I feel that understanding of the game, and the expression of its power, is central to making a film like this work.
Pretty straight-forward portrait of an amazing analytical mind. He's not your father's chess prodigy.
wanted to watch something to fall asleep but ended up staying up watching the whole thing lol
Fairly standard documentary in terms of structure but numerous home videos of a young Carlsen and strong narration from his father give some interesting insight into the rise of the current World Champion.
Crown me.
Perhaps not the most accessible documentary ever made however, I still thoroughly enjoyed the tale of Magnus Carlsen and his rise through the chess world. I think for many the thought of watching a documentary about chess would be a turn off and to be honest the film doesn't exactly go out of it's way to fight that. Often there are very detailed descriptions of chess moves that went over my head, or there were scenes of chess matches where the commentators would be talking about moves and to those not in the know (like me) this would mean nothing. It was almost as if the filmmakers presumed everyone knew about chess before sitting down to watch this, or they simply didn't care if you did or not. Yet despite these issues I still found myself getting wrapped up in Magnus' story and willing him on to do well and caring about how he was coping with the pressure.
A celebration of a chess genius. Nothing more, nothing less.
If I ever want to assimilate to Norwegian culture, I have to keep up with their claims to fame.
There is certainly the raw material here for a compelling documentary film. Director Benjamin Ree gets great access to the family archive and the footage of Magnus as a child is interesting, providing a glimpse at the kind of person who ultimately masters one of the most complicated games on the planet. Once this has been dispensed with, however, Ree’s film lurches forward in time for a linear, unimaginative description of Magnus’ life and career. Despite the early teases, Magnus never delves into the psyche or personality of its title character. We know Magnus is a fantastic chess player, but we don’t know how his head works. One talking head says that it’s as if he can “look into the matrix”, but we’re never quite sure what this means. With a little more attention to what makes Magnus tick beneath the surface and a greater, more detailed explanation of the inner workings of the chess world, this could have been one of the more compelling documentary films of the year. Unfortunately, it finds itself sitting a lot nearer the bottom of the genre pile, with its king trapped only a few moves away from a clear checkmate.
A very warm and honest portrait of a true master ...
Solid sports documentary about chess. Doesn't really pop in a meaningful way but perfectly watchable.
An amazing story of how a little Norwegian boy grew up to be the youngest world chess champion, Magnus, is about Magnus Carlsen whom we see all the way back to when he was a towheaded toddler from a wealth of home movies and with his father's voice-over, the clever dad that intuited how his son's thought process worked and guided him to playing chess at the age of 6. The rest of the movie is a moving story about father and son and Magnus's family, who are his biggest fans and how his mind shapes his personality. An intuitive chess player unlike most others, and seemingly free of psychosis, unlike others -- Magnus slowly makes his way to playing the current world champion in Chennai, India after showing us that he's a true prodigy by staging a number of brilliant chess stunts. The film is as fascinating for the way it follows and documents Magnus's way of dealing with things on his way to championship as it is about the game and the world of professional chess, the loving family that surrounds him and his modest approach to his passion for the game from an early age. It stands as one of the best character studies that's come along in a movie in ages. And he's so charming that it's hard to resist being enchanted by his whole presence.
A wasted opportunity for a very interesting story. No explanation for his performance under pressure and lacked any scrutiny of the role of his father.
As many may know, I've been struggling to watch as many of the 145 documentary features submitted for the Oscars as I can before the deadline for preliminary nominations of November 29. I say struggling, because as great as many of these films are, the real world as shown in recent documentaries is a pretty shitty place. So, it's all the more positive to watch an inspirational upper of a film like Magnus. I guess I live a sheltered life, because I never knew anything before about this "Mozart" of the chess world, an instinctual child prodigy genius that rose to become in 2013 the youngest world chess champion in history at age 23. OK, if you're like me that is a spoiler. However, the film does cover a remarkable span of this boy's life, much of it from his father's reminiscences and a remarkable amount of footage covering Magnus Carlsen's early life and chess playing career (I just discovered that even as I write this review Carlsen is defending his world championship in New York which will finish on his 26th birthday.) The film is structured chronologically as a competition sports story, with highs and lows, but mostly highs. Carlsen is not the most verbal of subjects, and chess is not the most visually interesting of sports (actually the film wastes no time in actually covering the intricacies of the games themselves, just focuses on the psychology of the players.) But, by the very nature of the luck of covering a unique and seemingly unspoiled champion from the start, the resulting film is just a delightful experience.
Pretty solid but no major accolades. Short at 75 mins. Would need a strong campaign for awareness. Director's second film, don't know of the first one.
Review forthcoming in Tabletop Gaming magazine issue 7.
It's more than fine, and wisely sticks to a short run time, because the story itself is rather slim (though good). Magnus is a good lead character, as he continues to reveal his complexity to us.
Wonderful engaging documentary about the world chess champion - his intuitive (vs the usual purely disciplined) approach, his humanness, and his wonderful family who so wholeheartedly loves his uniqueness and keeps him grounded.
