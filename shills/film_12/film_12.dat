Before I had ever seen the likes of Disney fantasy films such as Alice in Wonderland or Peter Pan, there was Labyrinth. One scene, in particular, would lay claim over my earliest childhood memory and stay buried in the recesses of my mind resting as a dormant dream waiting to be reawakened. Of course, I'm talking about the visually captivating, mind-warping staircase scene followed by the scene where Sarah confronts Jareth (ala Nancy in Nightmare on Elm Street). My first glimpse into fantasy was that of an ebony-haired, princess-like girl running through a three-dimensional geometric puzzle trying to save her baby brother in red-striped pajamas as the villain chases her while defying the laws of gravity. Imagine that being your first memory at two years old. The details, the shapes, the colors, the textures, the geometry. It was a complex vision that would haunt and enchant my thoughts for many years as I wouldn't learn of Labyrinth's existence for a very long time. Over the years, I would relive that memory, being in that old room, seeing that specific scene on the television as I wondered where on earth it came from. Over time, I surrendered to the reality I would never see that magical scene again as I never found the TV show or movie it came from. Which is why when I saw it again eight years ago on Netflix I was filled with euphoria. It was like magic to relive that one scene again, and to finally experience the story this scene took place in. That one scene is where my nostalgia stems from when it comes to this movie even though the most amount of time I viewed this as a child was probably five minutes. It's a remarkable scene I will always marvel at and my favorite scene of the movie. It's one of the few standout scenes from an otherwise lackluster fantasy film. Frankly, I never cared for Jim Henson productions; not even as a child. They bored me. The puppets are way too over-the-top. This production in particular also suffers from clunky dialog and a desire to make an Alice in Wonderland / Wizard of Oz episodic fantasy escapism film without any satisfying logic or memorable characters. The movie plays like a surreal dream disregarding spatial dimensions at times so Sarah can conveniently reach Goblin City before her time expires. Time doesn't even seem to matter in the end, since it's revealed Jareth can control the amount of time Sarah has left to save her brother. The rules are just unclear on that. There are many things about this movie that befuddle me. Why Jennifer Connelly is an overdramatic brat in one instance, and in the next completely reactionless when placed into mortal danger, and sometimes just walking cluelessly around with no real sense of urgency or agency. Her main problem is not knowing how normal humans would react in her given circumstances. Whether it was how the character was written, the direction, the skill of actress Connelly, or all of the above remains a mystery to me, but you know what, it sort of works overall for this particular story. Nothing really makes sense, maybe because most of it seems to be aimed at children. Where Labyrinth exceeds in quality is atmosphere. If you don't think too much on plot, dialog, character growth and dynamics, you can still be mesmerized with impressive sets and standout visual sequences. Oh, and David Bowie's wonderful music. Here are my favorite stand out scenes that call to the magic of a moment: -Opening in the park where Sarah practices her lines -Dance Magic Dance musical scene -Sarah's entrance into the Labyrinth -The masquerade musical scene -The warped staircase musical scene Essentially, when you throw puppets in, I become disinterested. The 'climactic' battle in Goblin City was a chore to get through. It's visually uninteresting and bloats the runtime; complete opposite of the staircase sequence (which is like something out of Inception). It's visually arresting and deserving of run time.
The most wholesome and fun movie
a fantasy coming-of-age classic that I didn‚Äôt watch until now, probably because I wasn‚Äôt even born when this movie was a thing. I enjoyed every part of it. It brings me strong childhood memories when all I did on my weekends was watching movies like the neverending story, E.T. & gremlins. oh dear, i¬†wish i could go back to those times.¬† thank you for this movie, jim henson.
its interesting what the ravishes of time do to you.... beside all the usual things, I had no idea this was a db song and dance vehicle I just remember it as jc running around petulantly with some moldy muppets unfortunately this rendition was slightly marred by having a call to nip into work, just as they were approaching the end game, so I had to pick it up again several hours later which might explain why I thought the ending was a bit of a cop out only enduring moment was miss connelly forgetting her lines on the lawn I always imagine 'baby' is duncan jones also hogwart - that sounds familiar
If David Lynch put a kids film together it definitely would have turned out like this.
all hail the goblin king
I‚Äôve got a double shift tomorrow and I needed this.
The only thing I loved about the movie is Bowie's necklace. I really want it!üòç As far as the movie, the lyric "love injection" says it all. It's like Motley Crue meets The Wizard of Oz, at the quality level of The Room.
Nothing could spoil my love of Jim Henson's work. But do you think that when the producers heard Bowie's stagnant songs that had nothing to do with the story or tone of the film, they were like "go on, you say something..."
Labyrinth is a movie in which a girl hates crying children so much that she willingly gives her baby brother to goblins. I can relate. But then, although she is bratty and self-important, Sarah (a teenaged Jennifer Connelly) has a pang of conscience when Jareth the Goblin King (David Bowie, whose costume and performance can only be explained by the fact that he is David Bowie) shows up and actually takes the child. Arbitrarily, he decides she has 13 hours to solve his labyrinth and rescue her brother. Defined by her strong will, Sarah determines to do it, and embarks on the quest to overcome a series of obstacles as she makes friends and enemies in the muppet-y goblin world. Oh yeah and there's a goblin world that I guess Sarah knows about because she read it in a book or something or it's possible the whole thing is just a story she makes up or dreams up while her parents go out and leave her to babysit. Directed by Jim Henson but written by Python's Terry Jones, the movie Labyrinth most reminded me of was Time Bandits; though it lacks Gilliam's signature visuals and the droll humor the Python crew brought to that film. Despite what the title would suggest, the film is a straightforward narrative in which Sarah encounters one challenge after another, which she solves with minimal effort, a ton of luck, and the help of some prickly puppets who fortunately for Sarah are at least as ill-mannered as she is. I like the adventurous vibe of the movie and most of the sets and puppets work pretty well. The green-screen stuff not so much. I'm actually a fan of the episodic nature of stories like this and I found that a few of the traps put out to ensnare Sarah and prevent her from completing her quest were thematically strong, like the old peddler who tries to make her complacent by loading her down with toys and knick knacks. Somehow, though, even as simple as the story is, it lacks a strong through-line and the comic action sequences are silly without being funny and the songs are just bewildering. Some of the characters, like Didymus, are really annoying. Brian Henson's voice work as Hoggle irked me too for some reason. I can certainly see how this might be a special movie to someone, particularly if that someone was a young girl when they first saw it. It's a movie aimed at children. As an adult man I can appreciate some of the creative bits but it mostly makes me scratch my head and ask things like is it a musical or not? Does Sarah learn anything from the experience? Why is the Goblin King the only human in Goblin world? And why do Sarah's parents want her to go on dates when she's clearly about 15? It's hard to put into words my lack of enthusiasm for this. I like weirdness but I like it bold and purposeful and a lot of this feels kind of random and meaningless. But Jareth would make a rad Halloween costume.
Never thought I'd say this, but this is too much Jim Henson and Terry Jones for me. The whole movie is just a bit much.
To summarise; Creepy goblins¬† Cheesy 80s guitar¬† Hoggle¬† David Bowie throwing babies around¬† Young Jennifer connelly¬† Hoggle¬† A maze Creepy David Bowie being creepy¬† Hoggle¬† David Bowie‚Äôs bulge
David Bowie: -tossing around a baby like it‚Äôs a ball¬† -singing magic dance with puppets -having a bulge in a kids movie -being in love with a 16 year old girl in a very weird and creepy way -doing that swishy thing with the ball and his hands¬† Is what makes this movie really good even now.
will forever be my favorite movie of all time. long live the goblin king.
I probably would have enjoyed this a lot more if I first saw this as a kid. And Jim Henson‚Äôs imagination is definitely on display. But this movie is definitely a product of the 80s that‚Äôs definitely dated in some ways, as well. Also, Jennifer Connelly‚Äôs character is a little TOO angsty for my taste.
sucks that i've said "someone take me away from this awful place" many times and yet i've never been whisked away into the goblin realm by david bowie. seems unfair
The puppeteering is great. The trick photography is sublime. I can't wait to scare the shit out of my unborn children with this.
Wears its heart on its sleeve, great scope villain & stakes, awesome production design + music, 'real life' bit cringey, fun!
I‚Äôm sure this was great in its day, but This one does not hold up the test of time. The plot is a bit troubling.
This was so weirdly sexual, why does he keep singing at her about how he wants to be her slave when she wants this baby? Why does he want the baby so bad
what a trip.
You remind me of the babe What babe? The babe with the power What power? Power of the voodoo Who do? You do Do what? You remind me of the babe
came here after just THINKING about the as the world falls down scene‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ there are no words to describe how much i love that and david bowie and jennifer connelly in this film in general
A wonderful tale! The story is super creative and the characters are very well developped and endearing. The puppets are perfectly done and look realistic. Unfortunately, all the green screen scenes are getting old with time. But is is still super impressive for a 1986's movie.
Back when I was five years old, in class on a Friday afternoon, the teacher thought, "hey, wouldn't it be fun to show the kids The Dark Crystal?" All the kids were scared shitless. Baaaad idea. Luckily, it came as a double DVD with another Jim Henson classic - Labyrinth. Back then, I thought the film was a great chance to pass the time away. I don't remember an awful lot about my first viewing of Labyrinth, and for the next ten years, I just forgot about it. When I was fourteen, I started going through a Bowie phase (well, I wouldn't call it a phase because i'm still in that phase right now). This was 2015, my art teacher (who also runs a prog rock radio program) gave me a USB disk full of literally every rock album known to man. Without that USB, I would have never heard the White Album, Highway 61 Revisited, Tubular Bells, or In The Court Of The Crimson King - all magnificent albums. But in that collection, he gave me every Bowie album, a gift which I am eternally grateful for, especially since about three months later he was fired for smoking in class. Bloody legend. Anyway, David Bowie meant a lot to me. He probably means a lot to some of you as well. So when his death came around in 2016, I relistened to that whole catalogue, and then I came across the soundtrack for Labyrinth. Sweet mother of god, was he in that? Yes. Yes he was. So, I made myself a promise to sit down and watch Labyrinth, a promise that I admit took me two more years to fulfil. There's just so much that needs to be said about it. Jim Henson, Terry Jones and David Bowie all working on this one project seems like something many would wish for if it didn't exist. Jennifer Connelly was amazing as Sarah, that's definitely worth a mention, but unfortunately a lot more of this review's going to be me gushing on about the Goblin King. How the fuck someone can possibly get away with an outfit like the Goblin King's is absurd. Like, in a KIDS FILM, there you have it. David Bowie's crotch barely hiding from full view. (I have a feeling that when in "Ziggy Stardust" he sung "Well hung with a snow white tan" he was just meaning himself...) Putting aside that, his performance is perfect. Like, there's many unforgettable villains in cinema. Darth Vader. Anton Chigurh. Biff Tannen. But never would I ever expect the Goblin King to top my list like that. He exceeded my expectations. There's also something great about the way he says "baby". I don't know what.
The music, the visuals...I freaking love this movie.
Just watched this for the first time. Dang
It's weird that this felt so much like Dark Souls: The Movie to me.
It's cute and stuff, but awkward. I have very little comment about the plot because it simply wasn't aimed at me, but the practical effects are really, really cool. The CGI effects, however, are really, really funny.
Oddly charming dark fantasy movie. Puppets plus for sure. Bowie yeah. üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è haven't seen this since I was like 5.
i want my 5 yo cousin to be ludo for halloween bc she now loves him and would kill it
This film played a big part in my developmental stage of life
One of my all time favorites. In my opinion David Bowie killed it as the goblin king. Love all of the puppets created by Jim Henson. Great movie would recommend this to anyone no matter how they are feeling. " Once upon a time, there was a beautiful young girl whose stepmother always made her stay home with the baby. And the baby was a spoiled child, and wanted everything to himself, and the young girl was practically a slave. But what no one knew is that the king of the goblins had fallen in love with the the girl, and he had given her certain powers. So one night, when the baby had be particularly cruel to her, she called on the goblins for help!" - Sarah Amaris
Bowie shagged a minor. This film just got spookier.
shout out to david bowie's dick
I love Bowie so much. Very creative, I never saw it as a kid but it reminded me of Neverending Story, which was a favorite. Magic is still fun, even as an adult.
Basicaly, the muppets feat Bowie
I‚Äôm tripping on peaches and it‚Äôs nothing but puppets.  But, seriously, there‚Äôs obviously a lot of cool, imaginative stuff in there, and I did like the whole female-hero‚Äôs-journey thing. The problem is that it turns out that there is, in fact, such a thing as too many puppets, and when you have a shot with thirty hairy, wrinkled, knobby doodads bouncing around at once it just looks like chaos. Also, great singers are not necessarily great actors.
This film never fails to put a big smile on my face. It's just such a good time from start to finish. Definitely a film to raise the kids on.
Jim Henson knows how to work those puppets!
This is weird yet very fun!!!
You're getting David Bowie, Jim Henson Goblins, fantasy, and a beautiful score? What more could you ask for
I couldn‚Äôt help but to laugh at every crotch shot scene of David Bowie
Although it's really weird it has decent messages in it. You get to see a character grow and change and impact the lives of others on the way. Children will love it.
Classic, masterful world-building from Jim Henson
A favorite, might as well revisit for Halloween.
Do you think that if David Bowie did a full frontal nude scene in this movie, his pubic hair would be an identical miniature of his head hair? ü§î
it‚Äôs more than an adventure. you need to learn about yourself to find the right way out. hardest decisions pared with the cutest characters you‚Äôve ever seen...in my city we call it ‚Äûsch√∂ne kombinaci√≤n". the structure of the labyrinth seems like a methaphor for life. breathtaking.
this gave me nightmares when i first watched it
it's a lot of fun, zero denying that some of it didn't age well though, like that uh CGI owl woof
George Lucas produced and Jim Henson directed this gothic fantasy which pits living and breathing actors Jennifer Connelly and David Bowie (who, along with Trevor Jones, provides the film's music) against a motley collection of Muppet monsters. The film centers upon teenage Sarah (Connelly), who lives in a fantasy world of myth and magic, evil spells, and wondrous enchantment. She is baby-sitting her little brother when she cavalierly wishes that goblins would take him away. She gets her wish, and a coterie of goblins abduct him. She then encounters Jareth (David Bowie), the ruler of a mystical world one step removed from reality. He tells Sarah that the only way to get her brother back is to find her way through a M.C. Escher-like labyrinth and find the castle at the center. As she makes her way through the maze, she faces a number of horrific challenges (like the Bog of Eternal Stench) before she finds her way to the gravity-defying castle, where her brother is being held by the evil goblins.
This movie is a ton of fun with magnificent puppetry, gorgeous scenery, wonderful characters, especially Ludo and Didymus, and a truly captivating performance by the late, great David Bowie. There's only one thing that holds this film back and, unfortunately, that thing is Jennifer Connelly. Her performance is rather wooden and her character is just not particularly compelling, and her being the focal point drags down the rest of the film. Otherwise, Labyrinth is an absolutely delightful watch that comes highly recommended. "Dance, magic, dance!"
for a movie with 10,000 puppets, practical effects, cool looking sets, and david frikkin' bowie, this one left me kind of shrugging???
Everything about this movie that elevates it to cult classic status holds up all these years later. Love the sequence with the pit of hands and I needed more of that little caterpillar guy.
this probably would have been a lot better if i was 10.
I've always been drawn to Jim Henson's creations, so I don't know why it took me so long to see this. Labyrinth is a mesmerizing and potent cocktail, the best metaphor for the transitional period of teenagerhood that I can think of-- adventurous fantasy antics and silly muppet sidekicks, enmeshed with the very adult, but equally fantastical, presence of David Bowie. It's an inspired combination, and Jennifer Connelly (channeling the same kind of energy she did in Phenomena, which isn't what I expected) is the perfect heroine to navigate it.
This movie is insane, different, imaginative, fun, creepy, and has David Bowie as a singing Goblin King that kidnaps babies with his Jim Henson muppet goblin minions. It‚Äôs fantastic.
Labyrinth is one of my all time favourite films. Every choice that they made in making this film was fantastic. The film itself is silly, every scene carries with it that strangely family friendly but funny quality to it that made The Muppets so great in the first place. But to such a higher level. The characters and costumes are great. I mean sure you can see every detail of David Bowie's clearly visible penis in every shot he's in, but the outfit is still memorable and grandiose, much like everyone else in the film. The set design and puppets were perfect. CGI and other special effects will never compare to practical real life effects I feel, and it really feels like masters were at work in turning the entire world itself into one gigantic work of art. On top of that, the music has that great 80's flair to it, the dialogue and lines are fantastic, and all the characters are some of the most likeable characters there can be. If I had any criticism, its that there are certainly some parts which are a bit cringy nowadays, and definitely some poor green screening at points. But on the whole, I'm just sad I never grew up with this film and I had to watch it when I was older, because if I ever had children then I'd want them to watch this.
that was A LOT
Starring the amazing Henson puppets, catchy music, beautiful set design. Also David Bowie's crotch.
A bit too weird.
A patchwork quilt sewn by Jim Henson, Frank Oz and David Bowie, paid for by George Lucas. By all means, this movie should not work but by some miracle it does.
A fabulous depiction of the unreliable narrator, drawing inspiration from classics such as The Wizard of Oz and Alice in Wonderland. You can tell David Bowie had an absolute blast starring in this. I especially loved how true to life his music stayed, kindof reinforcing the idea that our protagonist is drawing inspiration for her daydream from both fiction and real life. Perhaps even breaks the 4rth wall there a little bit. I know if I had an epic adventure story about me I'd want Bowie showering me with attention too, so.
You remind me of the babe (what babe? ) The babe with the power (what power? ) The power of voodoo (who do? ) You do (do what? ) Remind me of the babe I saw my baby, crying hard as babe could cry What could I do?

It has some interesting set designs and a film involving Henson, Bowie and Terry Jones could never be boring. Well done also to a young Jennifer Connelly.
The Wizard of Oz¬†on drugs, but actually much more intelligent than it may appear on the surface. Throw in a couple of David Bowie musical numbers and you really can‚Äôt go wrong.
if your favorite version of david bowie is jareth, then i have news for you: you‚Äôre gay.
Lauren from Fifth Harmony SNAPPT
The puppetry is fantastic. Probably the best I have ever seen out of Jim Henson studio. But... the film is a long and dull journey. The characters can be grating at times and I really didn't care for the music. Not my bag.
David Bulgy more like But wow this was weird, mainly cos it seemed like it was only a light tone shift away from being a really interesting and surreal piece
this is one of my favourite films as a kid but honestly what the fuck is going on here, it‚Äôs a hot mess and i love it
god. this was So good. i‚Äôve never taken an interest into david bowie but the synopsis of this movie sounded super intriguing when i was looking for movies earlier today, and BOY this did not disappoint. i loved every single one of sarah‚Äôs companions and was oddly on the edge of my seat for most of the movie. 10/10!!!! i would say this is now one of my favorite movies!!
It may be 32 years old,but Jim Henson's musical adventure fantasy starring a young doe eyed Jennifer Connolly is a remarkable achievement in the genre. Memorable characters especially a scene stealing performance by the late rock legend David Bowie.
When I was a child I watched this movie at least once a week because it was the only one at my grandmas house besides the land before time. RIP David Bowie and I love you Jennifer Connelly
this was so boring oh my god im sorry i really tried but its just not for me. this was the first movie in a while that i actually fell ASLEEP to... anyway the best characters were ludo and ambrosius !
borefest. david bowie crotch made me so uncomfortable
i lusted for bowie‚Äôs character at an inappropriate age
I was supposed to watch Pan's Labyrinth and screwed up but you know what? This owns.
And with one foul swoop, David Bowie made certain his streak of only appearing in dog shite movies would remain untainted. I'm not sure I can get across how terrible a movie this is. Imagine the most unoriginal school play, but with a budget. And even then the effects are very hit and miss.
Incredible. Not a thing i didnt like.
I wouldn't call this film a well acted film but the practical effects and puppets done by fucking Jim Henson (yeah the creator of the Muppets) who directed this film is fantastic. It drags in places and can be very weird and Bowie's original music is not as good as I was hoping, but it has a lot of heart, humor, and whimsy to pull it through. 8/10 full of things I love but definitely not a greatly acted character drama.
It's so good. I genuinely think it's one of the great films of the 80s. The puppetry is a demonstration of a true master at work. And the screenplay, by Python member Terry Jones, is simply wonderful. I love this film.
Phew that was a trip
Yup, this was a movie alright.
Absolute classic. Holds up better than I thought it would.
Bowie at what might well be his most attractive. A future Oscar winner. A soundtrack that works perfectly. And a ballroom sequence that makes Cinderella look mundane. This is one I rewatch because it's a joy.
I mean the babby is called Toby
You what I think the creepiest part of Labyrinth is... David Bowie having the hots for a sixteen old. Still can't get magic dance out of my head. (10/10)- Out standing ''Sarah... go into your room, play with your toys and your costumes... forget about the baby.''
I don‚Äôt know if there‚Äôs any movie that gives me more joy than this one.
Super fun to watch. Has good song and dance. Funny moments and fun riddles. Great characters. A classic.
This is a very style over substance movie. Admittedly the story is a little goofy and Jennifer Connelly's constant whining gets a little grating but the music, the animatronics, the visuals, the humor, the creativity, David Fucking Bowie! It's everything you could ever want out of Jim Henson, George Lucas, David Bowie, and Monty Python all working on the same film.
Animatronic puppets, music, a fantasy world, and David Bowie's bulge. What else could you want out of a movie? Edit: Okay so I rewatched this movie yesterday and now I'm giving it a real review. I think I first watched this movie when I was 6ish. My dad was a huge fan of sci-fi and fantasy movies so I got exposed at a very young age to a lot of things I'm not sure I should have been (thanks for scarring and confusing me for 10 years when I walked in on the ending of Carrie). Labyrinth is weird. It's about an s young girl (my best estimate was 15/16) who is asked nicely to babysit her little brother maybe once a week while her dad and step-mom go out on a date. Of course, she gets mad and compared her life to the lives of a 16th century African American. In a fit of rage, she says the magic words and asks the goblin king (David Bowie) to take away this child. Jennifer Connely gives an extremely mediocre performance. Her lines are exaggerated and almost yelled at some points. David Bowie gives a performance you'd expect. Kinda rapey but in the end he a believable goblin king (wait why is the goblin king human?). The practical effects are where this movie find its stride. Some of the most beautiful wells made sets and costumes that I've ever seen in a fantasy movie. Everyone from Hoggle to Ludo is brought to life by great puppeteering and the amazing artists who built them. Maybe I'm just nostalgic but I love this movie and will love it everytime I watch it just like I did when I was a kid
I am so, so here for anything Bowie related
Halloween Countdown Day 1 the puppets are nightmare fuel
Over thirty years on and there's still an endless imagination to Labyrinth that you can't help but get sucked into. It's actually been quite a bit of time since I've watched Jim Henson's venture into the weird and wonderful world of the Goblin King but the movie still holds up really well. You can forgive movies of a few decades age of a few dodgy effects but even with the classic 80's CGI it's still wonderful to watch and a movie that comes packed with such charm and child-like imagination to it that it really works for all ages. Plus what more would you want from a movie than David Bowie swanning about juggling crystal balls singing his heart away about goblins? Let's not beat around the bush here though - Labyrinth is super hammy. It is so over exaggerated in every way but I insist that people don't real this as an insult because it's part of what makes it such a fun thing to watch. A young Jennifer Connelly over-reacting to everything and not necessarily being too worried about being swept away into this fantastical world of goblins and crazy environments is actually quite fun when it sounds a bit ridiculous on paper. It's all whipped into a fairly simplistic plot - baby get's stolen by the goblin king, get through the labyrinth to save the baby - but because of Henson's pure imagination and creativity it makes it a much more enjoyable to movie to watch beyond the storyline. There's so many visual choices that stand out for me watching Labyrinth again that make it so memorable. One of the latter scenes in the movie has Bowie's Goblin King crooning his way around an example of Escher's staircase mazes with Connelly's Sarah still looking to rescue her brother that I just love to watch because it encompasses all the things that are good about Labyrinth - weirdness, silliness and Bowie. The character designs too are great to watch with Henson's work on the goblins and inhabitants of the Goblin King's world having a tremendous amount of character to them. It's a movie that wouldn't really work in any other era and has the right amount of 80's feel to it to make that style work to its advantage even in an age where CGI can make everything look 'better' but not necessarily have the same level of charm. Plus you've got the man himself, the Goblin King, David Bowie. You just can't imagine anyone else in that role. He makes for an enjoyable villain in his ice cold stare working alongside his posing and his... unavoidable southern eyeline. Yet for me it's the soundtrack that accompanies Labyrinth that really makes Jareth work. There's something oddly amusing about a villain singing away his plans in a Beauty and the Beast-esque way and just prancing about in his castle singing away but because it's David Bowie you can't really take your eyes off it all - probably because the music is unsurprisingly great. Just don't ask him who you remind him of. Yes, Labyrinth is campy and it is silly and over exaggerated but because of its era and because of that undeniable charm that comes oozing out of Jim Henson's work like this you can't help but fall in love with it. It's a movie that can work for all generations and have a little something that can enthral in all of its weirdness. even after all this time it remains great fun to watch and looks really great too despite those aged 80's CGI moments being so obvious but when you roll with The Goblin King's quirks and madness then how can you not sit back and enjoy Labyrinth?
I mean. Sentimental... I love this movie. Even if Jennifer Connelly's character is a little insufferable at times. I'm in love with David Bowie a little...
the jumpsuits David Bowie wore with his junk just hanging out .... no thanks
Looking back on David Bowie's filmography, it's hard not to feel a little nostalgic for the singer rather than the actor. Most of his films that aren't cult favourites like The Man Who Fell To Earth or Merry Christmas Mr. Lawrence, tend to see Bowie as a supporting player rather than the main attraction. Labyrinth may well have Bowie as the big name on the bill, but he's outshone by a galaxy of puppets courtesy of Jim Henson's workshop, and a fifteen year old Jennifer Connelly who's about to blossom into one of the late eighties most beautiful women. In this musical fantasy Bowie plays a goblin king who kidnaps a child at the behest of Connelly's Sarah who inadvertently wishes him into doing so. It's then up to Sarah to rescue her brother within a certain timeframe before he's turned into a goblin forever. I'm hardly the demographic for this film, it's a kiddie flick, or one for Bowie completists, but I actually watched it for Connelly. For a film that is very highly regarded, much like The Princess Bride is, I struggled to get into this despite the fun factor of Bowie doing his best Ziggy Stardust impersonation and wearing his own clothes. He sings too, sometimes it's like a bad episode of Sesame Street, and I did start to wonder what all the fuss was about? Cult film? Yeah, I get that, but the amount of Best Of Lists that this is on here on LB is quite astounding, maybe it's that nostalgia factor for some of us of a certain age, but I couldn't quite work it out.
You ever wonder what would happen if Jim Henson, David Bowie, and George Lukas smoked crack and made a movie? This is your answer.
the musical numbers truly are jams
Happy that this is out there
My all time favourite childhood movie with a range of unique characters and scenes. It‚Äôs interesting for me how they used puppets as characters and how the actors had to create relationships with them to portray a convincing story. The editing is obvious which is expected from a 1980‚Äôs movie but It gives a great nostalgic feel and it was used very effectively. An example is the scene is the castle when Sarah tries to get Toby back but a confusing set of stairs and arches is in the way. The editors edited David Bowie so that it looked like he was walking upside own and rotating around each ledge. This amused me as a child and so the editing was a success in my eyes. Also the soundtrack is amazing üòä
I would have enjoyed this more as a small child. Some pretty cool puppetry, and fun David Bowie music, but the story really dragged. It's no Dark Crystal, that's for sure.
Scared me really bad as a kid. I will never forgive David Bowie for this movie.
Wonder and excitement. No matter how many times I see this movie, I'm still filled with that same sense of wonder. When I first saw this movie as a kid, it made me realize that movies could be magical and enthralling. It's not a flawless movie by any means. But it is endearing and charming. Plus, David Bowie. This movie introduced me to Bowie.
Brilliant fun. My expectations of this were so low that I was almost blown away with how much I enjoyed it. What a wonderful adventure, and it kept surprising me with new and fantastic characters. Great soundtrack! Love that synth.¬† ¬†If I was pushed I would say this film is about some of the characters learning to be less arseholes, and the characters who weren‚Äôt arseholes to begin with blithely going on as they began.¬† Overall, very good fun. However, parts of it were very confusing, I got quite bored at the end, and I am not sure I ever want to see it again.
god i remember in uni we played a game where we drank every time we saw david bowie's crotch, and because there were like, some scenes where he didn't appear, we also had to drink when the girl whined at all absolutely wasted by the end
Definitely a much better watch than the last time I saw this. Maybe someday it‚Äôll return to its rightful place as a favorite. ¬†But for now, it was a good rewatch.
Now don‚Äôt let my 3 fool you, this is still a really fun adventure. The amount of artistry put into design. Only a certain mind could come up with something like this.¬† I would never say no to David Bowie and glitter
A very entertaining fantasy musical that I've inexplicably never seen until now.
My first time watching this since the days of VHS..I still enjoyed it.
The faggy fox with ADHD is a gay icon. Representation matters!!!!
This is the movie that introduced a young me to fantasy. It will forever hold a place in my heart for that and seeing it in a theatre was a real treat.
Should you need us...
This is one of the strangest movies I‚Äôve ever seen and this would NEVER be released in 2018. The 80‚Äôs were a VERY strange time for film, and this is one of the most unique and creative films I‚Äôve seen in recent memory, and while I didn‚Äôt fully enjoy it, I can appreciate the pure insanity of it. It gives off a special charm that you don‚Äôt see much today. Seeing it theatres also made it that more strange. ¬† 7/10.
This is one of my all time favorites. Each time I watch it I swear I love it just a little more. From the practical sets to the magical score, I will forever be grateful for Jim Henson bringing thhis into existence.
If you don‚Äôt like this movie. Don‚Äôt talk to me. Period. But seriously though, this movie is such a masterpiece! Great anamatronics, amazing practical fx, and incredible filming, also the costumes were awesome aswell. It makes it even better that George Lucas‚Äôs was working with them back when he was in his prime. This will always be a legendary film. Jim Henson will always be the puppet king.
The Hat: [as she and Hoggle goes off after sacrificing a contribution for basically nothing] Well, well then, there go a couple of suckers.  ... I wanna tear my own head off after that brutal number, jesus.
Pretty much the movie that whacked me upon the head and made me a David Bowie (the singer) fan, when I bought it on DVD in mid-2006 in my quest at collecting nostalgia movies from my childhood. Loves this movie to pieces.
Watched @ GQT in Savoy
Saw this on the "Big Screen" for the first time since it originally came out. I do love these movie theaters that show older films in the format that they were intended. Makes SO MUCH difference! Revisiting this childhood favorite, I was reminded of how much I have seen certain scenes time and time again... BUT... have not seen the very beginning hardly at all. I was shocked at how much I had forgotten about how this gets started (with Connelly quoting lines from a storybook that she has memorized, all dressed up as a maiden in the park). Then as the Bowie enters and the Goblins steal the baby, we get rolling with some of the most creative stuff to ever come out of the Henson idea factory. It's just WILD and CRAZY and UTTERLY CREATIVE work. Brian Froud's creature designs are grotesquely appropriate and delightful. I love so much about this movie. The craziness of the story, the awesome Bowie music, the production design and the fantastic puppetry going on. It's a sheer delight all around. So glad I got to see this again up on a huge movie screen. (I dock it a 1/2 star, only because Connelly's acting up front is very - how shall I say - limited. She is not good at the beginning of this film. But once she gets to the Labyrinth, she's better. I had not remembered her acting being so weak here. But there ya go).
I don't think I can really recall how many times I've seen this film, but I can usually remember the context of each time I viewed it. (Or at least a lot of the times I've seen it.) Mostly with friends and how we bonded over the film and how there was always a part of me that felt jaded that my love of Bowie existed outside of this film while theirs existed inside. Perhaps it's silly, but when someone thinks of a campy lowbrow existence of your idol compared to what you love about them, maybe it's okay. It's not like I go out of my way to shame people because I still enjoy this film regardless. Anyways, here are some of the ways in which I remembered viewing this (not in chronological order): - On the first date with my first boyfriend. That was also the first time I touched someone else's dick. - The weekend after Bowie died and my friend Erin came over and we watched this and The Hunger. - With my friends after helping one of them move into their apartment. - The first time I saw it in theaters (in 2016) with a friend who also had a love for Bowie. - The time I showed it to my sister and she had nightmares about David Bowie stealing babies. - The first time I watched it in sophomore year of high school and decided I needed to start looking more into this Bowie guy and listen to his music. (Which would be A Reality Tour since these were the only two Bowie related things at my public library!) - I'm sure there are other times I watched this casually without thinking much about it. So I admit this film turned me on to Bowie and I can't fault others who never took the leap to discover more of his stuff.
a childhood favorite
This musical fantasy is the cult classic collaboration of 3 geniuses, Jim Henson- the creator of the Muppets, George Lucas- the creator of Star Wars and David Bowie- the creator of glam rock who dazzles and charms in this film as the villainous Jareth the Goblin King opposite Academy Award winner Jennifer Connelly as Sarah. Henson took his art of puppetry to new heights with this '80s classic.
i couldnt stop smiling ! this movie was the best thing to happen to me as a child !
A cult classic Fantasy musical featuring the creator of Star Wars as executive producer This is definitely a fun movie and David Bowie definitely owns his role And Jim Henson did a great job with this film and all the puppets look great
I cannot stand the scene with those stupid headless Muppets.
I have already seen this film in a theater three times this year and I would do it again.
"You have no power over me."
David Bowie, muppets, a cute baby, and an 80‚Äôs synth soundtrack. Does it get better than this? Not really.
you remind me of the babe
My first time with this. It's one of many 1980s childhood classics that I just never encountered as a kid, never felt compelled to see as a teen/college student, and now watch at the unfortunate remove of an adult. All of which made the film by turns enchantingly strange and frustratingly tiresome to me. Henson's drawing on a motley crew of inspirations: Lewis Carroll, Monty Python (Terry Jones wrote the script), glam rock, obviously M.C. Escher. When that base material emerges to the forefront--the Escherian climax, the Carrollinian uncanniness and creepiness, the ball sequence, Bowie's bulge--this really works as a blast of pure childhood, fairy-tale anxiety. Jareth is explicitly an element in Sarah's mind, and he's at once a sexualized glitter demon and a child's primal fantasy of a kidnapping brute, with Satanic tendencies to match (he's also a tempter...). But the narrative's potential is cramped by the constant need to stop and solve various puzzles, which grows repetitive (same goes for the Alice books, I guess). Also--and this is a Me Thing--the movie is very much a puppet show, with sets to match: everything feels wonderfully handmade and tactile, save for a few glimpses of ghastly early CGI, but it also feels so...miniature and dare I say uncinematic. There's just no expansiveness. A child would obviously see things differently. This is a grouchy review. Anyway, kids should see it, what the hell do I know.
I don't know why I watched this because I don't like goblins.
I wish somebody would‚Äôve told me there would be singing and dancing, ‚Äòcause I would‚Äôve watched this a lot sooner. I loved all the musical numbers and watched them two or three times before moving on. The music is super good‚Äîwho knew David Bowie was such a great musician, huh? ;) I particularly loved the Magic Dance, and that Baroque ball sequence simply blew me away. The Escher-esque stairways towards the end with the baby crawling around and Bowie upside down was very cool, too, and the list could go on. It‚Äôs simply exploding with creativity, and great care has been put into every detail. Maybe I expected a little more metaphors and symbolism relating to Sarah‚Äôs transition from girlhood to womanhood while on her journey through the labyrinth, more ‚Äúlife lessons‚Äù, if that makes sense, but it‚Äôs very likely that one might discover more and more upon repeat viewings. I certainly will revisit. I believe great art happens when you‚Äôre not trying to make great art, and I found that here.
Good concept art all over... But that's pretty much it.
Who is the Goblin King? He's clearly human, but the only other humans in the "Labyrinth" world are the ones at the masquerade ball. But are those humans even real? Sarah shatters the illusion and escapes, implying that those humans were all fake. Therefore, is Jareth the only Human that lives in the Labyrinth world? I Imagine it like this: Jareth discovered the Labyrinth world. Simply by being much smarter than the Goblins and manipulating them, he became their king. He then enforces the goblins to build his castle and the labyrinth around it. Why? Because no one on earth cared about his music. Look at the "Dance Magic" scene. He just breaks into song and the Goblins LOVE it. They're so dumb, and simply play along the whole time, clueless about everything. What babe? What Power? Voodoo? The goblins are mostly too dumb to make their own music (good luck writing lyrics) and when the first musically capable person ever walks into their village, they lose their minds and immediately make him king. Also, is Hoggle a goblin?
What do you get when you mix the dark puppeted plots of Jim Henson and the antics of a rock star? Labyrinth. This film is weird and it makes David Bowie look like a creep (that might be cause he is idk). But, it‚Äôs pretty funny, most of that comes from the absurdity which, can be borderline annoying but if you find that kind of stuff enjoyable your probably like this film. 6.5/10
David Bowie Loves Contact Juggling David Bowie Fushigi Tutorial
Lots of highs and lots of lows for this one. Probably would have liked it more if I grew up with it.
Admire the practical effects but it sure is boring
Wacky is about all I can say. With a rousing turn by David Bowie as The Goblin King.
Big plot hole in this movie. Supposedly, Sarah only has thirteen hours to save her baby brother, but the scene with the Fireys and the whole sequence in the Bog of Eternal Stench together drag on for at least thirteen hours each. Still, if you've got a day to kill, there really is not a better popcorn movie than this.
If you‚Äôre a big fan of puppetry and creature effects like I am, this whole movie will be a treat. However, if the movie was exactly the same, but was animated, it wouldn‚Äôt be very good at all. Visually the movie is a 5/5 but has story and pacing issues.
the bulge ,,, can‚Äôt take my eyes off of it -gnomey üò≥
Haven‚Äôt seen this since studying it at school.¬† It was fortunately less disturbing. Terry Jones‚Äô input was very apparent now I know who he is, the inhabitants of the labyrinth are very much like Wonderland characters via the absurdity of the Pythons. It‚Äôs also a little saddening that our musical landscape is devoid of any weirdos who I could see making something like this. Lady Gaga is probably the closest we‚Äôve got and whatever A Star Is Born¬†is, Labyrinth it ain‚Äôt.
I feel like if you saw this as a kid you'd love it now. I enjoyed it but there is a huge gap between how much I like it vs. how much people love it that could only be bridged by nostalgia. The CGI owls are so laughable I thought that it was intentional to slander CGI because it was taking jobs from puppeteers.The audio is so off it makes you feel like the actors are puppets too. I really like a lot of the muppets and their character design. A lot of the concepts are imaginative. I thought the Shaft of Hands was so cool. It's some fun whacky fun.
A delight to watch. I admire The Dark Crystal for being so ambitious, but Labyrinth is so much fun, and another great fantasy film by Jim Henson.
Even though he's not actually singing "Slap that baby, make him pee," you and I both know that makes more sense.
I‚Äôm sorry but this was so shit, I can how I liked it as a kid but now it‚Äôs just shit.
David Bowie's crotch.
As the pain sweeps through Makes no sense for you Every thrill is gone Wasn't too much fun at all But I'll be there for you As the world falls down I didn't discover this movie until I was a teenager, but I more than made up for lost time after that. There was a while there where this was on constant rotation with me and my friends. Because of that, every Bowie track is thankfully forever etched in my brain. Revisiting it now, it's still a perfect movie. The HD quality shows all the visible strings people/puppets are dangling from, the dated special effects, etc., yet everything about Labyrinth is just as magical to me as it was back then. Bowie is the epitome of cool, bulge and all. Jim Henson is a genius, obviously. And Jennifer Connelly is on the verge of being a movie star. Yeah, Labyrinth is fucking beyond and such a moment in time.
Come for the wacky Jim Henson puppets, stay for the fantasy David Bowie tight pants.
I should rewatch this now that I appreciate David Bowie more.
David Bowie wanted to smash a 15 year old and a goblin muppet wanted a piece too
All I can say is if you have never watched this film u must do it now it is the definition of amazing and David Bowie definitely could of just done acting but gave us a beautiful gift of music he created.
Bowie is just completely show-stopping as Jareth and I forgot one of the Monty Python guys wrote teh script so there's a lot of just stupidly funny lines too. The MC Escher scene at the end is so cool, and I can't believe I forgot that Bowie is CONTACT JUGGLING like half the time what the fuck. also the music is fantastic cause of course bowie did all of it
One of those movies I did not particularly take to in childhood and rewatching it now as an adult not much has changed. Strange though to think that in a childhood spent watching Michael Jordan ward off aliens, Robin Williams cross-dressing, Bat-Nipples, Depp as a monster with Scissorhands and Michael Keaton as an insane ghost that Labyrinth was where I decided to draw the line.
I liked this a bit more than The Dark Crystal... but not by a great deal. The songs were fairly good and David Bowie and Jennifer Connelly were both good, but once again I just struggled to really get into it. And once again a lot of it is due to the aesthetic. Nothing really grabbed me and I wasn‚Äôt bored but wasn‚Äôt really entertained either. Labyrinth was an ok time killer for me, but nothing much more than that. Though I do really admire the puppet work. Typical quality we‚Äôve come to expect from a Jim Henson production.
I'm so grateful that the wall scene is still able to blow my mind
Weird and other wordly. For me, a clash of the clangers, pans labyrinth, alice in wonderland and adventure time, ¬†naturally, these all came after this film. Much enjoyment of David Bowie in his tights. As a realist, greenscreen work was hard to overcome.
You remind me of the babe! What babe? The babe with the power!! Checked this out on the big screen last night for the first time ever, I can‚Äôt believe it took me so long to watch it. It‚Äôs such a cool movie, totally an example of its time, David Bowie was the coolest person ever, period. Amazing puppetry too. I loved how it‚Äôs the kind of movie that so easily could‚Äôve been terrible but instead is a total classic that warms the heart.
Even though the young girl in this movie is overaly dramatic in every way possible I can understand why this movie is a loved classic... With creatures of all kinds & a adventure you‚Äôd like to take this film isn‚Äôt short in the creative category¬† If the catchy toons & pretty colors don‚Äôt catch your attention maybe the fact that a grown man is in love with a young teen might....¬† overall this movie was corny in all the right ways & is a good classic watch
Somehow with every viewing this movie gets better. I love it so much, and I don't know if I'm just jaded since I grew up with this movie and am in love with Bowie. This is a really fun and enjoyable movie with a phenomenal soundtrack. I can't get enough.
Not sure on the main actress. But this is one goddamn tight creative film. Surprisingly humourous, David Bowie is just awesome and fits in so well. The songs are absolutely insane but super catchy. Yeah, I really enjoyed it.
In Filmaffinity it note is a 7‚Äô2.
The puppets, sets, matte paintings, effects, imagination, etc are all top notch and a lot of fun. Unfortunately Jennifer Connelly has the charisma of a wet log which really drags the film down (SHE HAS THE SAME EXPRESSION ON HER FACE THE ENTIRE TIME!!!) and the musical numbers are not very good. I would rather just watch the films that this was inspired by (The Wizard of Oz and Alice in Wonderland).
i really didn't like this movie and i feel bad cuz it really isn't that bad, it's quite endearing, but i feel like you would've had to seen this before as a young kid if you wanted to like it in general. i'm 16 and this is my first time watching it and it just got so tedious and i didn't understand the end. what the fuck was supposed to happen? are you supposed to analyze this movie or is it just incoherent? did her mom leave her the labyrinth book? why did sarah and jareth have so much built up romantic tension? i feel like i didn't watch a correct version of a movie that was supposed to be wonderful.
