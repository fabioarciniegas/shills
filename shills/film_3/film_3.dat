“How did they ever make a movie of Lolita?” The tagline on the poster says it all. The answer to that question is that they didn’t, not really, and that’s for the best. The events of the 1955 Vladimir Nabokov novel are unfilmable as is, not only by 2018 standards, or even by 1962 standards, but really by any standards of decency and morality at all. It’s a film about pedophilia, the protagonist of which is an unrepentant sexual predator. It’s a film that I would hesitate to say is worth watching, but I’ve seen it twice now — once in a film class and again now. I doubt I’ll watch it again. Lolita is an interesting film for a few reasons. First, Stanley Kubrick is one of the greatest directors in the history of cinema. As such, it’s a well-made film, as repugnant as the subject matter may be. Second, the Hays Code sets suggestions of social mores aside and outright prohibits the depiction of many of the events of the novel. A film of that period couldn’t depict sex outside of marriage in a way that made it seem acceptable or arousing, and it had specific points about the seduction of girls, underage or not. For better or worse, Kubrick persevered. Kubrick finds ways to eroticize the relationship between Humbert and Lolita, opening on a closeup shot of her feet as her toenails are being painted by her stepfather, or having the camera leer at her as she sunbathes the first time Humbert sees her, underscored by that bubbly, playful pop theme. Naturally, the film is replete with editing ellipses to avoid depicting the more graphic elements of the story, but the nature of their relationship is far from ambiguous. James Mason gives a great performance as Humbert Humbert, and he looks intensely uncomfortable in nearly every scene (as he should), but especially those where he has to interact with people in his age group. Sue Lyon gives a performance on the level of any of the veteran actors in the film, and Peter Sellers is as much himself as ever, his performance bordering on annoyingly manic. Nothing is really clear about Kubrick’s intentions here. The film doesn’t seem to endorse Humbert’s actions in any way. After all, Lolita seems much happier without him, and both of her abusers end up dead. She survives the film, whereas she dies in the novel. However, depiction in itself can be a kind of endorsement through the mere act of choosing something to depict. Kubrick must have had a reason to make this film, and assuming that both he and Nabokov weren’t sexual predators, it’s still hard to guess what that reason might be. In framing their as one of tragically unrequited love, is Kubrick attempting to show how relationships can become abusive by depicting one that’s morally reprehensible from the outset? Is he attempting to illuminate how predators groom their victims, often by ingratiating themselves to the family? Or is he just taking a popular, controversial novel and adapting it because he felt like it would increase his stature? All of those are as equally plausible as not, and there are far too many films not about pedophilia for me to dig deeper to find out.
"Didn't you have a daughter with a lovely name?" Characters (6/10): They are okay but not very deep. It also not very clear why the protagonist is fascinated with Lolita. Story (5/10): The execution of the plot is good but the plot itself is not that interesting. Music (6/10): It does the job. Visuals (9/10): It looks good. I especially like the long shots. Enjoyment: 5/10 Overall: 6/10
LOLita? More like LMAOlita! But ya really creepy shit. James Mason is amason.
Many times, a film’s reputation will proceed it to a point of overwhelming any potential of interest it may have. The case with Lolita isn’t so much built up in terms of quality, but in the risqué nature of its material. The 60s were a time of considerable change in America, primarily in regards to sexuality. There was also a great upheaval of the Hollywood system, allowing filmmakers to tackle racier subjects. Lolita is one of the first films from this time to deal with the idea of a May-December romance, but unfortunately was still largely restricted by the powers still at hand. The film suffers a great deal from only being able to imply a lot of the feelings between its characters, though many great screenwriters have managed to find their way around these obstacles to extreme success for many decades prior. Even if one were to ignore the issue of the inability to communicate ideas subtly the film still manages to confuse and improperly communicate its main draw: the various relationships that are the center of the film. This is a romance film, a decidedly skeptical one yes, but a romance film all the same. The feelings Lolita and Humbert have for one another off and on throughout the film is rarely convincing, only made worse by the lack of straightforward dialogue. The film is also filled out by some benign characters who only add to the excruciating runtime of the film, with the only one of note being played by Peter Sellers, who somehow provides both the most entertaining and most frustrating moments of the film. There is still good in the film. For one thing, the black and white cinematography looks great, and the lead performance by James Mason is surely the best in the whole film. Shelly Winters also gives a fantastic performance here, but departs far too early and the film ceases to recover from her absence. Kubrick manages to flex his authorial voice here considerably more than his previous picture, Spartacus, but even with how simplistic and straightforward that film felt it was still more entertaining and stimulating, while also managing to justify its excessive runtime. The same cannot be said for Lolita, even when considering its boundary-pushing commentary on taboo relationships, which several other films throughout the decade would tackle better than Kubrick did here.
The first time I watched this I was in 4th or 5th grade. I was at my grandparents house one weekend and I woke up at like 5 or 6 in the morning to watch it on TCM. I wish I could talk to myself back then and ask what I got out of it. I think I understood the emotional journey if not the societal implications. Anyways, watching it as an adult is different.
Read the book before waching this movie! Kubick's Lolita is as addictive as Nabokov's work. Starting with the end of the novel the story reflects partially the book one because some parts have been cut and the ending has been invented. Although they both are works pretty different, Kubrick perfectly tells us the crazy and maniac love of Humbert Humbert for his Lolita.
A dark and twisted tale of a mind's disturbing obsession of a girl as they both use and decit one another. What I find most intriguing of this film is the use of light, happy orchestral themes within this very warped sense of love and commitment, with a around great cast particularly James Manson slow disarray of entitlement and passion and his cracks of insanity around Lolita.
Very engaging throughout the entire film. I did not feel like it was wasting my time - the pacing was slow but thoughtful. The film was at its best when the subtle differences between Lolita and her father were explored such as when they are talking in the car. The twist was clear throughout the entirety of the film, making it feel a little superfluous however this did not detract from a thoroughly enjoyable experience.
Think it may be my least favourite Kubrick film so far. That's not to say it's a bad film, it just didn't sit with me. I think my biggest issue is not really having a hook to latch onto anywhere. I didn't care for Humbert as a character or even his relationship with Lolita. Admittedly I will say I think Sue Lyon is superb as Lolita, probably the best performance in the entire film. And there's some great cinematography peppered throughout. Also strangely comedic in places. Bizarre seeing Kubrick do his own take on slapstick with the cot scene. But honestly the film falls flat for me. It doesn't help that it's two and a half hours long. It really felt like it.
I read Lolita almost exactly a year ago, which means I had enough distance from it, more or less, to approach the film on its own merits. On the other hand, the book created such a strong impression on me that little of it has faded in a year's time, so I can't quite describe myself as an objective observer. It's entirely possible that I would've gotten less out of this if I hadn't read the text. In any case, I loved this far more than I thought I would. Based on its reputation as a piece of work heavily compromised by the censorship of the time, I went in with rather measured expectations, all of which were exceeded. Honestly, the final product doesn't feel very compromised; yes, it's a bit less explicit about things every now and then, but Nabokov was never gratuitous about his subject matter in the first place, and Kubrick's ingenious approach to this material is to play it just like a normal Hollywood movie from the era of the Hayes code, complete with (gorgeous) black and white and a sweeping (also gorgeous) musical score, as if blithely ignorant of the perversity of what he's portraying. The first hour or so, in particular, is just excellent, a funhouse mirror screwball comedy only slightly more fast-paced, laden with innuendo,* and demented than, say, Bringing Up Baby or His Girl Friday. Shelley Winters plays the same character she always plays, but dials it up to 11, and the result is glorious; James Mason is brilliant as ever, in a role that finally (along with Bigger Than Life) gives his talents the showcase they deserve. The second hour of the film loses some of that energy, and not all of the digressions involving Peter Sellers' character are so compelling, but the film fully regains its power by the last half hour. If Lolita starts off as a parody of the American cinema of the '30s and '40s, it ends with a terribly sad slow-motion disintegration into alienation and loneliness that recalls the best cinema of the decades that followed. *CHARLOTTE: "Hum, you just touch me and I... I go as limp as a noodle. It scares me." HUMBERT: "Yes, I know the feeling."
So much is lost in translation. Almost worth it just to hear the music of Sellers’ and Mason’s voices.
So, first things first, this is a movie where the protagonist is a paedophile. So obviously that was uncomfortable. A friend of mine and I are working through Kubrick films and this was our fourth. We're watching them chronologically to see Kubricks development. This is clearly when he comes into his own voice which was obviously messed up but skilled in an unparalleled way. The last movie we watched, Spartacus, was a fascinating movie but it lacked the compelling characters of Paths of Glory and The Killing. Spartacus had some of the shots and theatrical excellence of Lolita though. Lolita's opening scene is the last chronologically, an excellent move when used correctly as it was here. Peter Sellers shined as the insanely creepy and unstable actor and play write. And in the opening scene his eccentricity is chilling, reading Humpherts poem and groveling in the emptiness of everything that is his life. The opening scene kept playing in my mind throughout the movie which is I think how it was intended. Kubrick managed to make you sympathise strongly with Humphert even tho you also knew how depraved and perverted he was. Even in the second half as he's beginning to crumble, there's still a place in your heart that wants everything to work out for him. This is a seminal movie in the way Kubrick challenged the norms and in some ways I think institutional censorship in art is dangerous. Good ideas don't need to be protected. But exploitation of the people portraying characters is an important point to consider. All things considered I thought Kubricks use of off-screen techniques was appropriate but the clear sexual innuendos maybe revealed a little too much levity. All in all a fascinating watch
Lolita Mixed bag. Wasn’t expecting it to be as funny. Although it’s uncomfortable to empathise with the heartbreak, I still managed to. Overall, it definitely succeeds in making me feel very sick.
I can see why Lolita is considered among Kubrick's minor works. Too washed out by censorship, the relationship between Humbert and Lolita it's not portrait very well, i can't feel the chemistry between them. Humbert motifs aren't clear as well. The final is kind of unsatiscatory. I think that the 1997 Lolita deals with this themes way better. However, is not afwul. I just saying that there is a lot of things to improve to reach the level of the novel.
I was really surprised by this one. I was expecting to be disgusted or revolted by its premise but, if you go in with the knowledge that he's a pedophile, the film serves as a sort of cautionary tale. The first half is even an unexpectedly funny and twisted dark comedy about marrying the wife to get to the daughter, but things turn dark in the second half and Humbert gets his deserved comeuppance. This may well be Kubrick's best or at least most classically directed film. His framing and shot choices are spot on and, though it is long, he really only overindulges when it comes to Peter Sellers' (admittedly hilarious) performance. The comedic undertones of the first half and deep-seated suspense of the second combine so well that it would even make Hitchcock proud.
"Underwhelmed" to say the least. The three previous films on Kubrick's filmography have all been between "very good" and "masterpiece". And this was the first one I ended up "meh", to be honest, I was very much bored through out the film. The film does show a rather disturbing subject without being completely explicit about it, which makes sense, but I was never invested in any of the characters making it hard for me to get chock or emotion out of me when the creepy stuff actually started, because I simply didn't care. Shows sickness, obsession and manipulation in a rather on the nose way, I got the paralels between mother and child and saw a few moments towards the end that showed how the tables have turned on this two main characters, but nothing that interesting, on my view. The performances aren't great, the tone is mildly irritating, the cinematography is always competent but much less impressive than other works from Kubrick and the whole story itself felt a normal "manipulating wife and crazy husband" kind of story, with the twist being a child. Sure, its sick, but felt very bland after a while.
not my favorite Kubrick at all but not terrible
It's makes much more sense hearing that Kubrick admits at the time that he didn't know what the real themes of the Nobokov book and that if he did he wouldn't have made it. It's well made and Peter Sellers gives a great performance as always, but everything else is just so clearly misguided in it's attempts to adapt the source material.
Pedophilia, He Wrote
Lolita, for me, is one of Kubrick’s weaker films. It has good acting and Kubrick is making his mark, for sure. But this movie had so many boring scenes by the end and it drags.
The main plot is very risque, at times leading it to be an uneasy watch, but I suppose that was the intention. Lolita was nevertheless exhilarating, captivating, at times darkly hilarious, which is something I have come to appreciate in Stanley Kubrick's film that I've seen. The entire cast give some of the best screen acting performances I have ever seen, bringing this preposterous story to life and giving it so much verisimilitude. While the leads are absolutely spellbinding, I found the supporting cast to be equally magnificent, especially Peter Sellers, whom I was delighted to see again after enjoying his roles in Dr Strangelove, which he and Kubrick would collaborate on two years after this. Despite the film occasionally feeling its length, I would say that it is the most I have been entertained by one of Kubricks films. Though I have not yet seen all of them, Lolita is the one that invested me the most so far, and it's largely down to the performances as I have mentioned. The dynamic between Lolita and Humbert could suggest many things, and I felt that there was a great air of mystery around what they were thinking throughout, trying to decipher just how stable Humbert really is despite his elegant outer nature, and if Lolita had any agendas of her own. It may not be held in the same high status as Kubricks other films, and that is partially why I was drawn to this film, but I found it to be quite great, and is definitely worth checking out if you haven't already.
This is not true in letter nor in spirit to Nabokov’s novel, which I’d consider my favorite novel of all-time, but in a way, Stanley Kubrick’s ability to a turn a novel as disturbing as Lolita into a hilarious and tragic satire is its own equally valid stroke of genius. The nature of the relationship between Lolita and Humbert Humbert is obviously censored, but Kubrick presents their scenes together in a manner that openly subverts the visual language of Hollywood romances. The film is at its most thrilling in confusingly intimate two-shots of James Mason and Sue Lyon, or in moments of heartbreak scored by the film’s surprisingly beautiful main theme. As director, Kubrick is constantly toeing the line between mocking his characters and empathizing with them in a way that I find rewarding as a spectator. Shelley Winters’ performance, a mad mixture of desperation and heartbreak, is a great indicator of what Kubrick is going for here - she’s hilarious, and despite how over-the-top her character may be, a bit of humanity shines through. I’m less sure about how the film utilizes the character of Clare Quilty, played by Peter Sellers, who awkwardly follows Lolita and Humbert around in a way that never feels truly necessary. Sellers is obviously one of the greatest comic actors of all-time, but sometimes he takes these big swings and they don’t really work for me - this is one of those times. The film not only obscures the details of Humbert and Lolita’s affair, but it also softens how horrible, evil, and manipulative Humbert Humbert is; I think that makes it challenging to watch in the same way that Humbert’s unreliable narration makes the novel challenging to read. In the midst of Humbert and Lolita’s domestic squabbles, you forget about Humbert’s unwavering depravity. I think that helps to make it a successful satire on human nature and the codified distractions of everyday American life.
maybe i'm biased because i'm a huge fan of the book, but i did not enjoy Kubrick's film much at all. the novel succeeds because you are implanted in HH's head, and the film loses so much bite as it tries to tell the story in a more traditional way. the novel had a manic energy & pace to it that James Mason's performance in no way replicates -- i'm sure i'm not alone in thinking Peter Sellers would be 100x better in the role of HH.
While the playful tone may be at odds with the subject matter, Kubrick manages to pull it off.
Yea even Kubrick can’t do the book justice
