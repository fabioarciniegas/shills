What a weird thing. Glad it exists.
Dafoe leathered up on a hydra-glide is an iconic look to rival The Wild One. Not so much in the way of story but Dafoe delivers some great narration and classic lines throughout. Good twist in the final moments. Great leathers and even better sickles.
This is the kind of debut from a director that says to me, "I didn't have a plot or budget that supports a plot, but to prove myself here's a movie anyway, fuckers". Willem Dafoe leads his gang of 50s goths on a journey of minimal introspection even as they are stuck in a one-horse town, trying to get down to Daytona for the 500 (I will never not geek out over casual NASCAR references in film). Not much happens besides the gang trading quips back and forth in their ancient teenspeak, which reminds me a lot of the merry band of molokos from A Clockwork Orange. Here it's kind of grating to the ear to watch and listen to everyone underact their persona. It's at least nicely shot, and approaches something of a story when the bikers cross paths with what amounts to this town's oil baron. In its final act, it's almost pretty likeable, but stilts on a batshit ending. Deep down it's a film about outcasts, but less about them causing trouble than being caught in a pot where trouble's already been stirred. If you wanna see Dafoe's dick 'n' balls, come take a ride.
This film just ended and I have absolutely no idea what it was about. Good soundtrack, though.
The Loveless is the first feature film by Kathryn Bigelow and co-directed by Monty Montgomery, whose only other credits consist of screenwriting and producing. It's a fine film, especially considering its student background and limited scope of production. However, it really only has three strong draws: It's recreation of the lower-class 1950s, it's meandering slice-of-life story, and Willem Dafoe's debut performance. The last item is the only one of any personal interest to me, so while I think it was worth a watch I don't see a whole of merit to the film as a whole. That soundtrack, though!
Should've watched Scorpio Rising before this; Bigelow has said it directly influenced The Loveless, and this sure is full of leather-clad queer-coded masculinity. Willem Dafoe is eroticised to within an inch of his life and it totally works; the film simmers with repressed violence and sexuality until it all predictably erupts at the film's conclusion. For an 82-minute film this is pretty languorously paced and stretched my attention span a few times, and it suffers from the common low-budget period-film downfall of being set in a specific time period but looking extremely of-its-time instead. But you can feel the oppressive Southern heat in every frame, Dafoe is magnetic as hell, and this is a pretty essential insight into Bigelow's early work and what would become her enduring fascination with the violence enmeshed in our culture.
Somehow boring and captivating at the same time. Imagine if this had a solid plot behind it, hot damn.
Kathryn Bigelow does a New Wave "The Wild One" with Willem DaFoe. Heavy on atmosphere, short on good dialogue.
Homage or parody? You be the judge?
I love Willem Dafoe in basically anything, and he does well here, but this is a pretty slow-moving film with some pretty mediocre performances. It definitely picks up towards the end, but it takes awhile to get there, and th but 50s cliché dialogue can be a bit distracting at times. One thing I did like—I liked that the biker gang did stir up trouble just to stir up trouble. The trouble happened because of the people who were already there, it was brewing long before they showed up, they were merely a catalyst.
Definitely a movie that does exist. It's interesting for how overtly female gaze-y it is and how everything Bigelow will become is there from the beginning, but like it's mostly kind of a snooze to watch.
Kathryn Bigelow debut film is film school The Wild One.
Watches Scorpio Rising once, makes Metrosexual Rising with babyfaced Willem Dafoe. Kathryn Bigelow's debut film, co-directed by Monty Montgomery, speaks a film school language and is surprisingly very similar to a Jim Jarmusch movie in still coolness, full of pauses and music-on-the-radio cues. But less surprisingly, Bigelow's attention is to male posturing, using a pretty boy who wants to be a bad boy, setting up a road map of great gender studies for three decades to come using genre-based filmmaking. Here, the genre is motorcycle movie, using born-to-be-wild fits of boredom to combat boomer nostalgia.

Cinematography almost wins the day, but the protagonists are never believable and the ending was ripped from a student's first-draft screenplay.
The entire movie feels like a massive exercise on being cool and turning your nose up at all the squares. Watching it today though feels like a movie that sparked the beginning of a fantastic director and the legend of Willem Dafoe.
Everything- the cinematography, the cast- looks beautiful. Nothing happens, but that's the point. A study of '50's Nowheresville through the eyes of a biker gang who stop there on their journey to Daytona.
Plotless and moody, but too long for the material.
So this really nails the aesthetics of the 50s that are the most appealing for their “coolness” and the sound design and music choices are really inspired. I really admire some of the really static shots and how long the camera is willing to hold and let the actors work in a specific frame.  But most of all I’m just confused because I can’t figure out if Willem Dafoe, who I can first remember experiencing in Raimi’s Spiderman, is actually strangely hot or not.
This is film very tied to it's environment where almost nothing happens. I have a weakness for these sorts of films and enjoyed it. Dafoe delivers a great performance, but the villain, whose name I cannot recall delivers a terrible one. The film is very mixed and your enjoyment of it fully depends on how engaged you are by Dafoe and how much you enjoy people just hanging out.
“The endless blacktop is my sweet eternity.” Acidic 50s nostalgia, monotonous yet magnetic. Carnal violence and ennui in greased hair and black leather jackets. Dafoe on a Harley forever.
I suppose this is a movie, but like so many first features by talented directors, only be the strictest definition. I kept expecting Mike and the Bots to show up in the corner and start making fun of it.
Has an authentic 50s look and feel which I quite enjoyed. The time period was very believable from the visual design to the acting. Cinematography and framing ranges from ok to really awkward. Lots of people’s heads were cut off in nearly every shot, as well as the 180 degree rule and rule of thirds were frequently broken which looked pretty messy. The story was pretty slow and eventless up until the ending, but overall, pretty solid first effort from Bigelow.
(whispering "you didn't hear it from me, kid, but you can see willem dafoe's balls in this flick")
Intriguing riff on juvenile delinquent dramas of yore, with near nonstop rockabilly scoring.  Comparisons to THE WILD ONE are fair.   Similarities to the works of David Lynch are iffy.  Debuting writers/directors Kathryn Bigelow and Monty Montgomery create a stylish but slowly paced and crudely edited sorta poem on the nomadic versus traditional mode of living.  Good first lead role for Willem Dafoe.
"Ive got an itch between my legs and an afternoon for a heart.
If this film is remembered at all, and it mostly isn't, it's as the debut of two great future talents, star Willem Dafoe and co-writer and director Kathryn Bigelow. The reason The Loveless remains mostly unloved to this day is that not much happens and the cast exhibits far more attitude than talent. So while it does succeed in striking a certain mood, said mood also isn't that engaging. This is a biker film with little motorcycle-related content as the gang lolls around a Georgia backwater in the 1950s, listening to rock'n'roll, littering, combing their hair and generally being a rebuke to the conservative values of the Eisenhower era by virtue of their mere existence. It also doesn't feel like a Kathryn Bigelow film as it contains none of her high-energy camerawork and escalating tension. For the definitive early Willem Dafoe movie and a genuine overlooked gem check out To Live and Die in L.A. (1985), and it wouldn't be until her next film, the intoxicating Near Dark (1987) that Bigelow would come into her own as a great director.
52 Years, 52 Women-Directed Films Challenge Film 18   Can I sit on it?    This movie had such a profoundly gay energy, which is what ultimately made it watchable for me.
In this movie full of debuts, it’s easy to tell that Willem Dafoe was going to go somewhere. You don’t see that immediately with Bigelow until her next film filled with vampires. (Also as an irrational thing that’s not fair to the film, I think stories about biker gangs always feel dumb.)
So this is what the alt-right wants America to be like again?
Man, I was what you call ragged. I mean, way beyond torn up. I weren’t gonna be no man’s friend today. Been out of storage for about a year now, and, to me, this endless blacktop was my sweet eternity. I knew I was going to hell in a breadbasket.  This movie is so much hot nonsense, but Willem Dafoe is sexy enough to make up for it.
a seriously deadly mix of art, influence and social commentary. I could watch this little tragedy over and over, like cool hand luke.
Tries to be so cool, but is just so lame.
The Loveless is the story of a biker gang that descend upon a small midwest town. The film suffers from a lack of plot and being dull. Willem Dafoe doesn’t bring anything special to his role other than being a brute.
Young Willem Dafoe looks like if Harry Styles was possessed by a demon
Two things that make this a curiosity is Willem Dafoe’s first leading role and Kathryn Bigelow’s directing debut (with a co-director). The easiest way to think of this is as a type of remake of The Wild One, where a motorcycle gang causes trouble in a small town. Dafoe is good and I liked the music but a lot of the 50s era dialogue was clunky and the majority of acting is quite stilted. The gang also isn’t a big terror, which is what I was kind of expecting. There’s some cool imagery and glimpses of good ideas that just don’t end up working. Not recommended unless you’re a diehard Dafoe or Bigelow fan.
The Loveless has the smell of student work about it. I don't mean that as a pejorative but simply as an assessment of the intentions of what Bigelow (in her feature directorial debut) and the multi-hyphenate Monty Montgomery (probably best known as The Cowboy in Mulholland Drive) put together over a period of 22 days back in 1980. That label, student work, is often seen as a criticism but to my mind some of the most interesting work out there has been done by folks who are putting together something only they could conjure up and by those who have done so with little regard for convention. The Loveless has many of the hallmarks we associate with that kind of work. The pacing is glacial, the narrative is as thin as a lace slip, and damn near nothing happens, however it has many of the things I absolutely love about weird little movies that couldn't have been designed with money in mind. Namely a feeling of danger, a sense of complete and total mystery, and directors and performers swinging for the fences like it might very well be their only shot to make a damn movie. Here we see a young Dafoe captivate with every word and every scowl as he stumbles from the city into a town that could just be a truck stop on his way to Daytona, Florida. That's honestly about where the plot begins and ends as the film moves into nearly exclusive existential territory, moving its band of outsiders through an increasingly hostile and ever stranger small town. Dafoe's Vance is a pleasure to watch, clear indicators of his eventual greatness on display as he becomes entwined to one degree or another with the women of the little town. His cool gaze and his hot reactions serve as the audience surrogate as he witnesses the prejudices and unfortunate behavior of both his crew and the denizens of the humid little city. It's a tone poem and a takedown of the 1980s nostalgia for the supposed halcyon days of the 1950s and Bigelow and Montgomery made a film that deserves to be in the kinds of conversations we have about Blue Velvet. While not quite as self-assured as the aforementioned Lynch masterpiece, it enters similar waters. Small town corruption and darkness viewed with fresh eyes and discomforting scenes of sexuality and prejudice set against the kind of scenic small town vistas we're more likely to associate with comfort and nostalgia. There are those "red ants underneath" as Lynch is so fond of saying. It also has one hell of an ending. I have a feeling that this is a film that will continue to grow in my mind over the years and with subsequent watches. For the time being, I can simply say this film is firmly in my wheelhouse and I am extremely glad to have come across it on Amazon Prime.
Willem Dafoe is the opposite of a vampire in the sense that he looks old at any age
i was breathless when the credits began
It never went into the “chaos” I expected or hoped for.
Cheesy with a dark undercurrent, reminded me of Twin Peaks. It was cool to see a young Willem Dafoe.
There are glimpses of what Kathryn Bigelow would go on to do, and it's an interesting debut for Willem Dafoe, but overall this is pretty inert and just ends up stopping.
i really really really want to see a criterion collection release on this
This movie had been on my radar because it is dafoe’s first movie, but didn’t realize was also Kathryn Bigelows director debut. Some strong similarities to near dark stylistically. Cool movie/ it’s very short which is generally a plus for me
It's a psycho rockabilly freakout! *sound of inhumanly high-pitched cackling*
One of those interminable kinds of grindhous flicks that just doesn't seem to have a point or an end in sight. Even so, watching the beginnings of Dafoe and Bigelow's careers was worth a watch.
A bit meandering but Dafoe steals the show as the quintessential unfeeling rocker
this film has all of my bisexual needs: 50's greasers, bikes, coca cola, women with short hair, neon signs, cinematography inspired by paintings, vague characters, and lots of leather
Made in 1982 and starring a Willem Dafoe in his 1st film. Its set in the 1950’s, has lots of black leather, greased back hair, motorcycles & music of the era. Basically, it’s a bunch of bikers killing time in a small town. It’s quite slow and not the most uplifting experience, and probably only of interest to those wanting to see a young Willem Dafoe’s buttocks
Rough around the edges but atmospheric and fun to watch.
i’ve been wanting to get a bike lately. just last week, i googled “how dangerous are motorcycles really”
Me watching 'The Loveless': media.giphy.com/media/oygbdZvAdWWys/giphy.gif
the poster image >>> the movie Lethargic, low-stakes; literally a movie about the mild debauchery some mildly gnarly people get up to while waiting on a a vehicle repair, up the very final moments, at which point occurs a violent, disturbing conclusion that comes out of nowhere and makes little narrative sense. Not at all what I excepted from the debut of a director whose career has come to be defined by knack for propulsive, story-focused action and a gift for building and releasing tension. There's no tension here, nor any action. It's just 80 minutes hanging with some dirtbags. Never would have pegged this as a Bigelow film. That said... I kind of liked it! Feels like a lost David Lynch picture. The Loveless especially resembles certain sections of Twin Peaks: the Return, with its long, silent, hypnotic drives and the constant, vague presence of some peripheral evil. And wow. Willem Dafoe has always had one of those faces, hasn't he? Even back when his skin was smooth, before it turned to treebark. He sits and blankly stares into some unknown offscreen void for most of this movie, and it's impossible not to stare right back at him in the same way, wondering what hell that man must have witnessed before we met him, what lurid life he left before hitting the two-lane blacktop.
Willem's first starring role and Bigelow's directing debut. A 50s biker gang stops on a square, hick town on the way to the races and shit happens. Off the shame list! Great, surprising ending.
Flat and uninteresting, I'll watch any Willem Defoe performance tbh
A sleepy biker movie that is mostly salvaged by a compellingly cool central performance from Willem Dafoe. Most notable for being a stepping stone for its star and co-director Kathryn Bigelow, as opposed to a lost gem.
you know why i watched this
Kathryn Bigelow's directorial debut (co-directed with Monty Montgomery) is a real moody piece of filmmaking. Willem Dafoe stars as an apathetic biker whose gang terrorizes a small town for a weekend, exposing the terror that already existed within. There's a fascinating Lynchian feel to it all, but the pacing really hurts it.
all the music in this movie sounds like it’s from the 50s but really it’s just one of the cast members doing an elvis impression and i think that’s some excellent low-budget filmmaking riGht thEre
I really like this movie because nothing happens in it and I can relate to it emotionally
Posits "cool"—the post-war, rock n roll/ Brando-in-THE-WILD-ONE vision of it at least—as, in its extreme cases, really just emotional distress, neurosis, and anxiety borne (often) from a long-held trauma large or small. Bigelow seems to focus on the moments of damage in that facade instead of those that translate to glamor or beauty or sex. Even when depicting glamor, beauty, or sex. If you squint real hard might remind a bit of Andrea Arnold's AMERICAN HONEY. Almost. Has a masterful sense of quiet, too. Rhythms not dictated by dialogue but small action or passage of time. Fantastic.
As a showcase for a new filmmaker this has a lot of strengths. The image of the 50s is strong through the soundtrack and iconography, to a degree that the stereotypes can be played around with. The compositions are also consistently attention-grabbing. On the other hand the acting is terrible from everyone except Willem Defoe. This is mitigated quite a bit though, by the fact that there isn't any story that the actors need to convey. Unfortunately that also makes the movie feel like a complete waste of time.
A stunningly well-crafted debut effort from Bigelow, this is suffused with an air of inescapable melancholy that emerges at the forefront of the narrative by the time we reach the film's haunting conclusion.
"I had an itch between my legs & an afternoon for a heart..." I've always jived with the mid-20th century aesthetic, so this has 'me' written all over it. Throw in a super young, brutally cool, leather-swathed Defoe, & I'm in celluloid heaven. First of all, the soundtrack really nails the feel of the era. Every song in this has that undercurrent of raw sexuality that was just hidden enough to be radio friendly. Although, I think the older generation just wasn't listening close enough. If you're not taking this as a sort of 'satire' of the Kenneth Anger-genre, you're not going to dig this. Every line is laced with the same dead-pan delivery. Not much happens in terms of plot, until the final scene. But the gorgeous imagery is really what this is about, & it's showcased beautifully. The authenticity of everything is spot-on. This isn't for everybody, but for those who 'get it' this is a delicious little bite of greaser angst & rockabilly swagger.
(Monty Montgomery and) Kathryn Bigelow's SCORPIO RISING
Not perfect, but damn close! The sketchy quality of the version available on Amazon Prime notwithstanding, this is one of those films that I come across occasionally that I really don't know much about, have never really heard anyone talking about, much less singing the praises of, but pretty much entirely blows my fucking mind! I can't really understand why this film isn't more in the conversation. It completely anticipates Blue Velvet, Twin Peaks and Wild at Heart (and given that it came out in 1981, it seems somewhat likely that it may have directly influenced David Lynch. And I'm not just talking about Willem Dafoe playing a character that very well could have become Bobby Peru after years of drugs and a head injury or two. There were many times when I was struck with the similarity in tone between this film and Blue Velvet. Etc.); but also deserves to be discussed more in context of first films of important directors: Kathryn Bigelow (co-directed with Monty Montgomery, about whom I'm going to have to find out more).
i did not like this. amazon prime version of this cuts out at the beginning and end.
just the bad parts of Twin Peaks + the underside of Willem Dafoe's balls = Kathyrn Bigelow's The Loveless p.s: the copy of this movie on Amazon Prime turns greys and glitches out 3 or 4 times in the first 5 minutes and then several more times towards the end and I guess no one involved noticed ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
If only the individual moments, the sinful compositions, the brilliantly lewd surprises, the perfect period soundtrack cuts, the badass final 10 minutes, added up to something.  Kathryn Bigelow's first feature and, naturally, first of many journeys into a gang of macho toughs, stars a leather-clad (and pretty great) young Willem Defoe as the leader of a 50s biker gang, shaking things up in a small Souhern town en route to the races in Daytona.  It starts and stops and then fits and then it's over. And I realized I had nothing to show for that long 79 minutes.
Student film full of potential and interest. Scathing dissection of a genre that typically glorifies a toxic masculinity. Beautiful imagery.
if you ever wanted to see bigelow eschew plot in favor of hanging out with uninteresting 50s biker stereotypes in a small southern town this is the movie for you. ill stick with blue steel 👌.  the run time is glorious though.
Some low-budget films--they're often exploitation flicks like this one--exist not because they are compelled by a story that needed to be told but because they are compelled by a moviemaker who needed to make a movie. I'm trying to be charitable toward a filmmaker I would come to enjoy. This was an attitude in search of a topic. It's supposed to be a deconstruction, but it's as aimless and exhausting as the nihilists it's trying to critique.
While it has the pacing and reflectiveness of a student production, Bigelow's The Loveless is a fascinating mood piece about the toxic masculinity of 1950's biker culture. It's dark and unsettling moments of rape, incest and suicide are quite haunting. That being said clocking in at roughly 80 minutes, this movie manages to feel long and often lost my attention. I like that it sets the stage for the rest of her filmography and is a great introduction to Defoe but I can't imagine anyone really loving The Loveless.
This is a surprisingly great little film consisting almost entirely of atmosphere. It's primarily concerned with filling out every corner of its period environment with little details and ambience. The characters aren't so much up to no good as they are up to nothing at all... loveless/thoughtless/aimless... a minor work that feels both lived-in and still alive.
A much quieter film than I was expecting but I think that works well for what Bigelow and Montgomery are trying to convey. The 50's were just as messed up and hard to live through as any other time in modern America, even when viewed from the rose colored glasses of the 80's. The Loveless is a not so subtle takedown of masculinity, but the directness of the themes is countered by how contemplative and reserved the camera is. As the bikers are hooting and hollering the night away the silent horror of what one girl has done is viewed from afar by our protagonist Vance, a man so distant he feels nothing. This is all conveyed without dialogue. A harrowing but wonderful sequence to end an impressive debut.
Basically the only pure "hangout" movie I've liked, because it understands what a good majority of hangout movies do not; the setting must be a character, as much as the characters themselves. Like a lot of debut filmmakers, Bigelow's still learning the style/substance balancing act, but her raw talent here is almost tangible. We feel the 50s, oozing out of the screen, every beautiful, terrible, bigoted part of it. It's still a bit too plotless for me to rate higher, but Bigelow shows that you don't necessarily need plot to demythologize an era. When you build a time and place up so convincingly, you don't need to tear it down; by the end, the audience will feel so trapped, we'll want to destroy it ourselves.
a crowning achievement in the depiction of drinking out of glass bottles on screen
This is a strange movie. It's very slow and methodical while not really having a straight plot. It feels more like a collection of events than a story in a film. Willem Dafoe is great, as always, and he really carries the film out of mediocrity. It's not a great movie, but there is definitely a level of craft here that I can appreciate.
Some cool visual stuff going on here, really liked the look. Felt like an Easy Rider for a later era, just much less successful.
As a deconstruction of 50s motorcycle subculture and masculinity it works, but as a movie it works less so at time. At times exhilarating and at times languishing, it sits awkwardly between great and tiresome. I can't tell if I love it or not.
KB should go back to making kenneth anger movies
Shows the early seeds of what Bigelow will do later on, but in the end it's slight. Dafoe is excellent though
Interesting to go from Strange Days to this, because that is a movie defined from its very first shot by forward momentum and not catching its breath (to its disadvantage in a few spots at the end, but a total asset otherwise), whereas this is paced like an IV drip and feels longer despite being a good hour shorter. That being said, I wasn't really bored during it, mostly due to the combination of Willem Dafoe, some nice shots, the music, and the wonderfully overwrought tough-guy lingo, and I actually think it kinda lands the ending for as much as it dithers around aimlessly in the lead-up. But I cannot see myself thinking about this movie much after tonight, and soon my thoughts will return to Angela Bassett's all-encompassing ownage.
Why aren't we all just constantly eating breakfast at diners?
I'm all here for sexy, young, leatherclad Willem Dafoe, but this thing is just so slooooooooow. Call it a 'tone poem' all you want, doesn't change the fact that its boring as hell and I can't remember a thing about the characters or story.
A kind of shapeless tone poem of a movie, but there's definitely promise that indicates Bigelow's future career. Fascinating to consider how steeped in style and mood this film is, considering how uncompromisingly austere her latter-career films have become. (This isn't meant to be a negative, but there's no denying that her recent filmmaking has a real austerity to it.)
Relentless. What a debut for both Bigelow and Dafoe.
There was no love.
Great soundtrack. The movie itself is kind of boring. Felt a lot longer than 100 minutes
Can roll with it enough for about 30 or so minutes, then just gets old. 79 minutes, feels like 119.
Rating: B- This movie was good. Definitely not great. Unfortunately it did feel a bit stretched and thin. Willem Dafoe chews the scenery. I kinda dug it? Ah I dunno..
Boring. Its ambitions are lofty but its execution comes off pretentious and half baked.
Aimless and confusing. There is absolutely no point to this film but at least everyone gives decent performances.
The Loveless is all vibe and no juice, a film so enamored with affected boredom that it becomes boring itself. It's still stylish, though, and Bigelow gets the formula exactly right in her next film. As per usual, what she has to say about femininity is a lot knottier than her take on masculinity, which is as coruscating as in her more well known films. Willem Dafoe is truly disarming as a babyfaced greaser, as opposed to the craggy weirdo I'm used to.
Marin Kanter tries to compensate for her anachronistic pixie cut by being insufferably belligerent. Thankfully the film seems to realize this and gives her an appropriately pathetic death. The rest of the edge, coming mostly from a posse of four dumb, pretty leatherboys, is adorable. Willem DaFoe brings some subtle charisma to the lead role, and the whole thing just has a nice relaxed period realism to it. Bigelow and Montgomery address composition and lighting with a very even hand, and Gordon brings an atmospheric soundtrack. It's just all-around good filmmaking. And then suddenly DaFoe is taking Kanter from behind and you can't help but do a triple take, wondering why it just turned into a gay porno. It's certainly not the only homoerotic moment in The Loveless.
Femtember #1 Bigelow completely and utterly dispels the myth and preconceptions of the biker gang film. It's like the complete opposite of Kenneth Anger's fastball approach of montage and music. Taking a slow burning view of a group of biker's who stop off at a small town diner on there way to a professional car race. It strips away many of the tropes associated with the genre that was popularized by films like The Wild One or even Rebel Without a Cause, creating a portrait of youth trapped within a set of pre conceived notions. A fascinating work from start to finish but one I understand the indifference toward. Personally I think it's one of Bigelow's best or at least amongst her most internally fascinating.
A biker gang roles into a small southern town where they kick up a bunch of muck and leave their wreckage behind them. Focuses highly on the bikers and less so on the actual wrecking. Co-written/directed by the cowboy from MULHOLLAND DR.
I watched this but nothing happened. Willam Dafoe is a greaser who sits at a cafe with other greasers for a few days and they talk about nothing that makes sense and then the movie ends. My husband loved it. Said it was like Twin Peaks. Would have been a great 15 minute short though.
Bobby Peru: The Early Years
Not to be annoying but when is leather-clad Willem Dafoe going to ride his motorcycle past me when I'm stranded on the side of the road and fix my car and steal my money and make out with me and terrorize the small town I live in with his homoerotic motorcycle gang?
Such a student film, and basically just a vaguely engaging Wild (cl)One, but...something about it sticks? Main takeaway is that I hope Willem Defoe has started eating better.
"I've got an itch between my legs, and an afternoon for a heart." Kathryn Bigelow's first feature film was this low-budget biker film, which she co-directed with Monty Montgomery, who would go on to produce David Lynch's "Wild at Heart" nine years later. The film shares Lynch's conflicted view of the 1950s - it revels in the cool of the era, but it's also willing to expose the menace that lies beneath the decade's bucolic surface. Willem Dafoe, in his film debut, stars as a 1950s Detroit biker who gets stuck with his gang in a seemingly sleepy southern town while on his way to watch the races in Daytona. The filmmaking is self-possessed, as cocksure and collected as Dafoe's character. But it's tortuously slow. It's only 82 minutes long, and yet it feels padded out. Still, the style and Dafoe's magnetism are mostly strong enough to carry it.
Cruises on atmosphere for most of its short running time before delivering a well-staged violent climax. Fascinating gender politics, should be considered before leveling the charge that Bigelow gives women short shrift in her films.
Feels more like an extremely gifted student film than a proper feature; if the Bigelow of later years is here in any particularly clear way, I'm not sure where. Still, it's a terrific first feature, capturing something about the mood of '50s biker culture that has a different kind of menacing undertone than one might expect. Willem Dafoe, in his first film, is better as a presence than an actor per se - though what astonishing presence it is. Mostly worth seeing for curiosity's sake, but it's curiosity that will be amply rewarded.
This started off fascinating and deliberately paced and I was so excited to see how it would use the character to make the story more exciting...but it never really got more exciting. The story just kinda chugged along with nothing really happening; I didn’t know anything about the characters and nothin paid off. I’m not sure what changed for the characters from beginning to end, they showed up in a town and left it a bit of a mess but I wasn’t sure what the point of it all was. I mean, maybe I’m asking too much of every film I watch to leave me fulfilled but this one in particular I thought had such potential in the first act...and never acting on that potential in any meaningful way. The performances and cinematography were great but I couldn’t help but feel as though the lack of story damaged the other aspects of the film. Let me know what you think of this and what all the movie means to you, I’m open to having my mind changed! 6/10
Not really a full movie, but an interesting start to an amazing career. Two careers actually. Dafoe crushes.
Mostly an excuse to play around with rockabilly aesthetics, but there are a few moments that rise above the rest and make for an enjoyable enough time.
In lieu of director Kathryn Bigelow's Detroit, I feel it is necessary to watch how far she has come to become one of Hollywood's best and most socially conscious directors. Though it has committed performances and maintains a strong sense of place, The Loveless is a methodical, experentially nihilistic biker drama that effectively homages 1950s biker films, but cannot overcome its dispassionate characters and rudimentary narrative. More importantly, one can tell that Bigelow wants to explore America's cyclical racial tensions, but lacks the perspective and experience to do so. I am glad she waited until she was ready, and I have no doubt that her patience enabled her to crush it with Detroit.
All I could think of was Scorpio Rising so I immediately turned on blue velvet
only cool part of this was when a racist scumbag shot herself! nice!
Definitely style over substance, but luckily it turns out that Kathryn Bigelow has always been pretty great at style. Willem Dafoe oozes nonchalant cool, and it's fun if you're in the mood for pure '50s nostalgia, even if the actors sometimes stumble over the knowingly cliche-heavy dialogue.
A wonderfully well-realized sense of place and time, with just the right amount of satire to it -- and a marvelous soundtrack -- but eventually the lack of a, you know, coherent story kind of wore on me. Not at first, but after a while.
Nothing happens for 70 minutes and then a rush of plot and tragedy in the last 10. A biker gang orgy certainly seemed possible.
come on kathy
[44/100] Stylish, with some nice colors and compositions, and with the cool '50s soundtrack constantly humming in the background, it's frequently a great hangout movie. This last element is maybe less Hawksy than American Graffiti-ish, but leaning more comic-book than fly-on-the-wall realism. Either way it creates a memorable setting. For me, the social commentary elements came across as fairly vague, and The Loveless felt forced as it ramped up the seriousness in the final 20 minutes. I didn't end up getting too much more out of this than the great vibe and the fascination of watching the young Willem Dafoe. There is definitely some promise in the visuals and the hazy, unhurried nostalgia of the lonely southern highway diner and Scorpio Rising iconography, but I'm not sure how much it all adds up to.
This movie is like a mutant offspring of Easy Rider and The Breakfast Club.
Unlike some of the best 'hang out movies': Rio Bravo, Stranger Than Paradise, Jackie Brown, Dazed and Confused (and Slacker and Waking Life and most of the other Richard Linklater films), the characters in The Loveless are no fun to hang out with. Not because they are immoral or try not to show any real emotion, but because they are a bore. A better way to experience this movie for maximal enjoyment is to allow yourself to roam around the southern locations it takes place in. The movie is a paired down distillation of a certain style these bikers embody, with a crisp and elegant visual style, a lack of self-realization that is acknowledged during the climax and a sort of world-view at the edges of the frame. It also isn't very interesting or fun. I guess the one real reason to see it is for Willem Dafoe's first leading performance in a movie.
Is Willem Dafoe hot? A case study.
early proof that Kathryn Bigelow only makes movies about bad boys, preferably of the leather-clad variety. lots of sallow southern atmosphere in this one, like a tick could bite ya at any second. fuck 50s nostalgia, and if this were made today, fuck 80s nostalgia. Willem Dafoe should join up with the Fast Family.
Dafoe gives a wonderfully virile and cocky performance, and the 1950's small town setting is captured well, but a scant plot and terrible supporting cast prevented this from shining.
Dresses itself up like a party animal and then sits in the dirt and does nothing for an hour and twenty minutes. 'The Loveless' is the equivalent to a goth poser kid angry at his suburban parents for wanting to buy him new shoes. We get it! You are so edgy, dude. I'm sure later you are gonna write some really deep stuff in your journal about how Dad wants you to play sports. Get off it. Sad too, because Willam Dafoe could have acted the hell out of this role if he was given an actual character to play. Spoiler alert: Kathryn Bigelow later learns how to add substance to style.
I've decided to attempt to write a few sentences on here everytime I watch a movie so I can remember more than just my initial vague impression. Anyhoo, I can't say for sure without having seen the 50's and 60's movies this is modeled on whether this is a homage or a deconstruction of those tropes. Either way, it's distractingly mannered and the camerawork is impressive in a kind of insufferable way a lot of first films are. Luckily Bigelow turned out to be great so I don't feel too bad for not liking her debut all that much.
It clearly has its flaws. But at the same time, it's absolutely perfect. Fuckin' art.
Kathryn Bigelow's first, Willem Defoe's first. That's all I can think to say about it.
Well, that was kind of boring... But on the upside Willem Dafoe sure does make a bunch of Willem Dafaces in this and those are always.... Oddly compelling to look at
It's a shame that a damn plot had to happen to this movie, because it's at it's best when it's just hanging around in neutral. Like a cool, sexy, drifter... Agreed, the film would be little more than biker iconography, early 1960's eye-candy and moody tough guy narration without it, but that's enough I think - especially at 82 minutes - you can get away with something a bit more sparse. Regardless - this is a unique and wonderful little slice of early 80's American Independent cinema. And, Willem Dafoe, come on - you gotta love him. He moves his body so deliberately here, casts his eyes so specifically and easily, what a screen presence. A bit more like a model than an actor in some ways, and dressed like he walked right out of Kenneth Anger's Scorpio Rising.
“We’re getting ourselves some liquid entertainment” Kathryn Bigelow’s debut feature feels very much like a debut – it’s loose on plot, heavy on mood, low-budget and the first trembling touches upon themes the director would later explore more. Willem Dafoe (in his second role in his career) fits smoothly in this mold as well, but he doesn’t exactly breathe life into the silent biker-character we’ve seen before. The same kind of character has also had more heavy themes tied to him in other films, Dafoe’s silent character is a good contrast to the macho group that’s often seen in biker-films but while he’s somewhat outside of that masculine heteronormative mold it’s never really explored. The Loveless has some great groovy music to bring the right kind of cool to everything and it fits the laidback, thin story. Unfortunately, the anonymous characters in the periphery of Dafoe is given too much of the spotlight as the film trades the nice silence for empty dialogue. It’s an interesting mood-piece as a start for Bigelow and Dafoe – but with such thin jabs at themes the director would go on to explore much more it’s ultimately not very spectacular.
Willem Dafoe, you sexy sonuvabitch. I'm intrigued by your sweet tooth & the way you eat your eggs. I respect the limited dialogue & mood cast in Bigelow's directorial debut. Although the pacing is likely to turn most people off, there are enough captivating shots sprinkled throughout to keep you watching & intrigued.
Stylish and restrained at times, the debut feature co-directed by Kathryn Bigelow with the debut of Willem Defoe as a biker in the 1950s. Impressive art direction and writing that is a bit loose with some of the more cliche elements of 80s films showing up, it's more of an exercise than a fully realized film, but interesting in how it predates some of the other takes on the 1950s.
It's inconsequentially short, and historically interesting for being both Bigelow's first feature (a co-directed effort with Wild at Heart producer Monty Montgomery) and Willem Dafoe's first screen-credit. Storytelling wise it's pretty aimless, meandering, even a little boring, but the signs of potential are there and it exudes a certain "coolness."

This movie is worthless trash. Sorry, Kathy Bigs <3
"So what's a bum got to do to drive this thing?" "Turn the key."
This is Kathryn Bigelow's directorial debut, along with co-director Monty Montgomery. Set sometime in the 50's, it follows Willem Dafoe (also on his debut), as Vance, a biker that's cruising through a small mid-Western town, along with some friends. While in town, Vance and his friends meet a wide array of characters, among them, a diner waitress, a mechanic and his son, and an oil businessman and his young, rebellious daughter. In that respect, the film is a bit loose with no defined plot structure. The characters just go from place to place without an apparent connection. It is only in the last act that they try to build up a climax between Vance, the oil businessman, and his daughter, but it feels a bit forced and underdeveloped. Despite these flaws, the film was never boring. Plus, despite some scattered weak performances, most of the cast is solid. Dafoe, in particular, has a strong performance. Finally, at roughly 80+ minutes, the film is short and breezy.
I do like a film that has a strong sense of mood, and films that are more character than story. This film is all of those things, but I think its shapelessness is actually a bit of a problem. At times it can work, and it feels dreamy and engrossing, but other times it feels frustrating and dull. I don't need likeable characters to enjoy a film, but I do need something MORE than what's on display here. I adore Willem Dafoe but his character is slight to the point of being just an image. With Bigelow behind the camera, you do get the feeling that that is maybe the point, but she would go on to couple that dreamy imagery to more fun and likeable movies later, particularly Point Break and Near Dark. It's one for Bigelow completists, but it is and it is a somewhat interesting curiosity - the kind of film you might find while flipping through channels late at night and stick with just to see what the hell it is. And while it has flaws, it does have something that has left me thinking about it the next day.
pretty extraordinary. great sdtk (Robert Gordon so...duh) w/add'l help from John Lurie, and a knock-out brilliant ending. Biker film extraordinaire for sure. Low budget glory!
" I ain't as white as I look." Def gets a star just because Defoe is a babe.

You wanna know how I got these scars?  It feels like a first film and it definitely drags. The 80-minute runtime felt closer to 120. But hey, Kathryn Bigelow had to start somewhere and this is just fine as a jumping-off point. Included in these lists
I like that I watched this movie; it was interesting to see the depiction of 50s hoodlums, and Willem DaFoe's performance was good. But it wasn't a very good movie to watch due to some drag and a general ennui that emanated from the characters that made me wonder why I should care much about them. I've hit a low point in my #52moviesbywomen project
What a sick bike flick. The only thing missing from this film is some sick burnouts and donuts. Sexy Willem Dafoe, what a guy.
Kathryn Bigelow's film debut, conceived of and co-directed with fellow Columbia student Monty Montgomery, a future producer for David Lynch who plays the cowboy in "Mulholland Dr.". Willem Dafoe (in his film debut) stars as the leader of a bike gang travelling through the south to get to a stock car race. One of the bikes breaks down in a small town and the locals clash with the bikers. This sounds like an exploitation film, but it's more of an art film that bathes in the exploitation cool of the biker image (a bit like Kenneth Anger's "Scorpio Rising"). In a quite literal sense, nothing happens for a lot of the film as people stare at each other meaningfully. Nonetheless, I found it mesmerizing and it is vaguely reminiscent of a Lynch film with all of the weirdness removed. Rockabilly musician Robert Gordon co-stars as a fellow biker and provides most of the score.
Slow pace and uneven storytelling, but beautiful cinematography and a charismatic performance from young Willem Dafoe. The best part is the soundtrack by Robert Gordon and John Lurie, which is downright Jarmuschian.
the ghosts of the highway. how fucking boring it is to be lost and the chaos that can form out of directionlessness. everyone is a l o n e. is it our own faults or is natures genuine study of human to be alone. its how we live, its how we die. bigelow's kind of proto-near dark where the biker aesthetic is alive and the vampires arent mythical forms but rather the mythical lie that the road and being a western nomadic is romantic.
Nothing about this was appealing, interesting, or effective. Except maybe the soundtrack. But nothing else. It's all either setup or outlandish, detached terribleness. We should all be glad Kathryn Bigelow moved on to action movies, as "nihilistic Jarmusch ripoff" didn't fit her talents well at all.
What a cool picture. Killer soundtrack.
Any film with Robert Gordon in a Leather Jacket gets an extra half star, and "The Stroll" by the Diamonds gets another half star--that makes a total of one star. The diner is probably worth another half star, though that total would wildly overstate the value of the screenplay and filmmaking here.
"You know, I ain't never seen nothing 'fore like it in my life *spit* they're animals. Hell, I'd love to trade places with them for a day or two." The feature film debut of director Kathryn Bigelow who co-directed with Monty Montgomery and the first leading role of star Willem Dafoe. There's no plot per se. Just a group of bikers (led by Dafoe) in the 1950's hanging around diners and garages, driving around and conversing pointlessly. The flip side is how the locals react to their being around. This slow moving and nihilistic biker film is stunning to look at, with every image being fetishised; Leather, diners, belt buckles, flesh, lighting, garage interiors, hair, bikes and cars. Every line of dialogue is peppered with pessimism, cheese and style. The soundtrack is outstanding and works in perfect harmony with the love Bigelow, Montgomery and DP Doyle Smith put into the visuals. Everything in the film is captured with as eroticism and emptiness. Its like a dreary partial fantasy come to life. If the film occasionally (or largely) feels stilted the style more than makes up for it and though it's definitely given priority over substance, I wouldn't call it entirely empty. I loved this film.
This movie was really neat. It takes after like this subset of pulpy biker movies, evidently, but it rather reads as sorta the anti-biker-flick, from what I understand them to be. It's very very slowly paced and there's a very legitimate degree to which you could argue nothing happens for a long long chunk of the movie's runtime. That's sorta the point. There's a bunch of bikers who ride into town at the beginning of this movie and rather than the like vaguely pirate-ish portrayal and understanding of bikers, they just kinda mill about and do normal shit until they're ready to move on. The people in this town, though, get really antsy really quickly, and that's what the film is getting at, that people beget this movie's violent ending due to their own expectations and projections onto the bikers rather than anything they actually do themselves. I think it's really fascinating and at its best the movie can sorta carry that tension in it purely visually in that way that Bigelow exploited a lot in her two most recent films, even as essentially nothing is happening. It's a dangerous gamble, though, and one she ends up falling ill of on more than some occasions. I would be impressed to see anyone make something so actively kinda distancing completely work at any point in their career, much less as their first film, and Bigelow definitely didn't totally swing it, it can drag quite a bit. That sorta synergizes with some stuff that's not like a huge problem but makes the movie offputting as well; it's very dedicatedly aping the sort of pulpier elements of those aforementioned biker movies, which include some really goofy performances and some really leaden dialogue and at its best that can be really charming but when the movie starts dragging it certainly doesn't help right the ship, let's say. One of the performances is actually Willem Dafoe in the lead in his debut and I wish I could say he arrived with all of his magnetism intact but, not quite. All of that said, though, I ultimately find myself thinking really fondly of the movie and think it's very natural that this is where Bigelow got her start. I'm excited to get through a lot more of her films!
Decent directorial debut from Kathryn Bigelow. The movie is shot well and has great music. The plot is a bit too thin though. The movie is set up like The Wild One but it feels a lot more realistic so much in fact that it just kind of drags. This movie is a definition of a slow burn and I liked it but I also felt it could have done a bit more.
Eww to anyone who puts ketchup on your scrambled eggs.
Leave it to Kathryn Bigelow to make such masculine films which fuel dangerously on the sensitivity within most of all. Her "The Loveless" is one of those post-greaser movie types that bleed the lines between James Dean vulnerability and "The Outsiders" posing with the story of bikers including a young Willem Dafoe fueling his character with a fractured frame that feels as put-on as it does naturally so. While Bigelow’s "The Hurt Locker" and "Point Break" seem to be about the man’s chase for adrenaline-spiked orgasm, her directorial debut was more intent on capturing the way people can shift their own personalities through their faux-performance art.
How did I never know about this flick until yesterday?? I'm not a huge Bigelow fan, but I love Near Dark, Strange Days & Point Break. On the other hand, though, I'm a massive Willem Dafoe fan and just look at that cover!! How could I not love this film??! Objectively, I guess if you weren't a fan of either of these thngs then you probably wouldn't like The Loveless. It's a slow, meditative, almost plotless film about a motocycle gang who's mere presense causes a small, backward town to fall apart. It's part arthouse, part exploitation biker movie - but all Willem Dafoe. It all takes place during one day, and almost entirely in a single location (a diner). Words are spoken, but they rarely matter. 50's rock songs are played continually and hypnotically as Dafoe and his band of homoerotic biker buddies stir the pot. Surrounding them are curious but distrusting locals - many of them damaged or dangerous themselves - who are mostly hostile towards them. As the day goes on the tension builds and builds until the inevitable, explosive climax tears the town apart. This all makes it sound like there's a lot happening, but there really isn't. The Loveless is definitely more of a Mood Movie. Some of the major plot points are dropped in conversation but mostly we learn everything we need to know from characters simply looking at each other. The 50's soundtrack is super cool and prevents the film from ever become tedious but if mood ain't your bag then you're definitely going to struggle with this movie. Speaking for myself though, i LOVE mood and The Loveless is moodier than most. Between the tense directing, decent performances, brilliant soundtrack and Willem Dafoe, this movie delivers just about everything I look for in an arthouse/exploitation flick. (which this definitely is) A recommended curio.
The Loveless plays out like Easy Rider meets The Wild One, except it's set in the 50's. It's a slow burn of a movie and to tell you the truth nothing much happens in it that would keep anyone's interest. Willem Defoe is a great actor don't me wrong but he just seemed so out of place here as cool cat Vance, a member of a motorcycle gang heading to Daytona for a bike race. This is an early film of Kathryn Bigalow's, you can see her style taking shape here, it's probably one of the better things about the film. Also, the soundtrack is pretty great.
Very strong debut film, and even though Bigelow co-directed, her style and themes are as present here as in her later works.
First films are not always Reservoir Dogs. I keep telling myself this as I work through my podcast's latest run of Home School Film School - First Films from Notable Directors. Kathryn Bigelow's first film doesn't show the pension for action for which her future films will be known. However, it does show the thoughtfulness take on tough guys and violent moments. It's slow, but I got into the weird groovy thing going on in the hour and 22 minute runtime.
Kathryn Bigelow's feature directorial debut, and Willem Defoe's first starring role, was not what I was expecting. This film is almost 35 years old, yet hearkens back still further to the 1950s with its imagery obviously reminiscent of The Wild One, and also putting me in mind of Douglas Sirk to a certain extent, but without the melodrama. Nothing much happens - small town ennui is too much to take for the bikers who are passing through - but the oppressive mood is almost Lynchian, probably driven by the soundtrack. It's interesting that Bigelow should so often focus on the male in her films - I don't know enough about her or her work to comment in any depth, but she definitely brought a different perspective to the male peacocks astride their Harleys.
Existing somewhere between David Lynch and Kenneth Anger, The Loveless is mostly Kathryn Bigelow still trying to find her style but with a conclusion, I personally appreciate: when outsiders stir up trouble in a small town, it was because there was trouble to be stirred.
this movie is supes coooooool, slow-burning, pretty shots, great soundtrack.
I totally love how this movie looked. Great compositions, great wide shots, awesome colors, etc. A real slow tense pace. Plus, the sound track is sweet.
The music in this film is great.
This catatonically slow existential biker movie attempts to channel themes present in Kenneth Anger's Scorpio Rising with The Wild One and fails to work or be in anyway engaging. It's unfortunate considering that The Loveless was Kathryn Bigelow's directorial debut and Willem Dafoe's first starring role.
Sort of like The Wild One, with a pinch of Russ Meyer, a dash of Kenneth Anger and a sprinkle of Tom of Finland. Interesting debut from Bigelow that is quite different from her films to come but still is an interesting observation of masculine culture through a retro lens.
You know how people say that foreigners make the most interesting movies about the United States? Well, (and take this with a grain of salt, because who knows how much ought to be attributed to Montgomery) the same can be said about Bigelow and masculinity. This is a cool first film, though not without flaws, especially when it comes to the pacing, which is maybe a little too deliberate—the intention may have been to mount the tension slowly, but the tension just is not always there. The imagery is interesting and composed, with rare but very deliberate camera movement. I guess the concept might be: The going nowhere fast thing involves a lot of doing nothing. In the motorcycle movies that this is sort of deconstructing, you have got these characters who cultivate an image but aren’t given any other real character. So, what you get is a bunch of people who are kind of aggressive dicks but don’t really do very much, but even so, the townspeople react to them as if they’ve been super-active public menaces.
Vance is like a younger cousin to Defoe's Bobby Peru, a monster that wouldn't surface until later in the decade. Until then, Kathryn Bigelow's portrait of a long afternoon full of tension between backwoods Georgia locals and greaser ex-con bikers plays out like a preamble. The burner is low, but the heat that will soon rise out of David Lynch's 1960s is very imminent in THE LOVELESS.
Low on plot, but throbbing with mood, The Loveless is America's subversive nature wrapped in lurid colored undergarments. Every frame is bursting with lust, loneliness, and homoeroticism. Bigelow (along with Monty Montgomery) directs with a flare for compositions rarely seen in her later works. The colors and framing here are preludes to the '80s fascination with the '50s that would be so prevalent in Paris, Texas, Stranger Than Paradise, and Wild at Heart.
Masterclass in capturing the sound and atmosphere of the South, something that recent films seem to struggle with. The Once Upon a Time in the West x Sal Mineo in Rebel atmosphere is unique and they pull it off in the most earnestly heart wrenching manner, something eludes most road films. Though maybe its because this is the only road film where they never end up leaving.
Bigelow cites Fellini and Bertolucci as well as Ulmer, Benedek, Sirk and Anger as role models for this, her film school thesis. Great photography, art direction and editing if not much in the dialogue and plot department. Willem Dafoe's movie debut.
Pointless story of greasers in a town for the day that ends in pointless violence. Quite dull.
Curious, offbeat debut for Bigelow (and co-director Montgomery) is well shot and amusingly apes '50s biker teen movie tropes to nihilistic ends, but performances and storytelling are wobbly at best, never really convincing.
It probably says something about Hollywood, that the only woman to ever win an Academy Award for Best Director, makes such masculine movies. With an Oscar win for The Hurt Locker and a nomination for Zero Dark Thirty, Kathryn Bigelow is no stranger to making tough as nails movies about tough as nails characters. And with Point Break, she has a genuine action movie hit to her name, that seems to be more and more beloved as time passes and nostalgia grows. So even though I knew absolutely nothing about her debut before I started watching it, it was no surprise to see that there’s a bubbling pool of testosterone at the core of The Loveless. FULL REVIEW AT boredanddangerousblog.wordpress.com/2013/12/03/movie-review-director-debut-week-bigelow-the-loveless-1981/
Bigelow's arch ars poetica–Lynchian before that was a thing–gives the name violence to a stillness borne of Jean Genet & Kenneth Anger. An affected analysis of cool on par with Rudolf Thome's Rote Sonne. Free, wild, cool and death-like. (Monty Montgomery went on to produce Wild at Heart and the pilot to Twin Peaks, and to play the cowboy in Mulholland Drive.)
This Interesting and dark reimagining of 50s nostalgia is the underseen debut from Kathryn Bigelow - I was interested to check this out because I heard Bigelow talking about her admiration for and influence from Douglas Sirk, one of my favourite directors, on a special features from Madman's wonderful DVD edition of Interlude (1957). Considering the only Bigelow I'd seen was Hurt Locker, I thought this a peculiar reference point, and she said how much in particular it affected her first movie. And I kind of see it, (though the more obvious reference point for the film is The Wild One with Brando) and it's a cool little film of its own. It has a cool soundtrack, a great sort of coloured style and so on, and a great performance from a very young Willem Dafoe, who retains all his unique diction and menace from some of his more effective roles later, and he's great to watch. The acting among the rest of the players is pretty mixed, and there's not a lot to differentiate the characters or any real story. It's just a sort of cool movie, if not exactly great.
An excoriation of Reagan-era nostalgia for the Fifties, in the manner of Christine and Blue Velvet. The central image has Willem Dafoe swathed in leather from head to toe, posed atop his motorcycle against roadside verdure and bathed in bluish light. As it did for Kenneth Anger, The Wild One provides Kathryn Bigelow and Monty Montgomery with a key into a culture’s trance of polished metal and violent sensuality, l’amour et la mort. "This endless blacktop is my sweet eternity," the biker leader muses, a "weekend in the country" pits the daddy-os against the leery, envious small-town squares. Dafoe saunters into a café in a rhomboid composition scored to Brenda Lee, then into a bit of Hawksian courting around the jailbait tomboy’s (Marin Kanter) corvette: "What’s a bum gotta do to drive this thing?" "Turn the key." The gang slut steps out for a Coke while the fellas throw switchblades between each other’s legs, the tangled flesh of Dafoe and Kanter in the motel room is alternated with race-riot footage flickering on a TV screen. Finding the kinetic melancholia in this material is a job for Walter Hill (Streets of Fire), for angular, languid, deadpan satire you turn to Bigelow and Montgomery. A film-school thesis stretched to feature length, yet the hunger for pure form is unmistakable -- the South is a coiled abstraction of extra-crimson soda machines and garages, a phosphorescent green cloud surrounds a waitress as she strips down to her pointy bra. The pop-art lines could be out of Lichtenstein, with their disproportionate intensity humorously reflected in a scene in which a tiny matchstick is lit with a hail of target-practice bullets.
This film has moments that feel like a David Lynch film. I have to say that I will never watch this film again because nothing really happened in this film for the hour and 23 minute film. There was some great moments in it mixed in with the moments where nothing did happen. William Defoe is good in it because it is not what he says but rather what his face says. It is like the Wild One just not as good.
Kathryn Bigelow's feature debut, with writing and direction assistance from Monty Montgomery (who would later go on to produce for David Lynch), is light on substance and loaded to the hilt with style. Set at the tail end of the '50s, it's essentially a mood piece about Willem Dafoe (in his first starring role) and his small biker gang rolling into a sleepy nowhere town in the south, and the various ways the locals react to their arrival. With the briefest of excuses for a script, don't expect a whole lot of surprises in the story department. The town offers up the usual assortment of characters – repressed women who see the bikers as either filthy animals or sex on wheels, resentful rednecks with the trunk full of guns, and a few regular people inbetween. Dafoe is reliably charismatic in the starring role. Marin Kanter, who reportedly quit acting shortly after this movie, is also memorable in the role as the rebellious teen Telena. The rest of the cast is a very mixed bag, with plenty of wooden acting and the occasional burst of scenery chewing on display. But Bigelow and Montgomery are clearly more interested in fetishizing the '50s rockabilly culture than telling an original story, and are happy to let the so-so acting and clichés slide along, as long as it's captured beautifully and with a lingering gaze by the camera. And that it is. Bigelow fans will have no problem recognizing her signature style, albeit in a slightly undisiplined, early form here. The tone of the piece is not a million miles away from that of Near Dark, and the two movies could comfortably be programmed together as a moody double bill. Bigelow would of course go on to make better movies (the aforementioned Near Dark in particular), but The Loveless makes for a stylistically satisfying start to her career. The lack of substance and originality will leave non-fans of the director to struggle to find something to enjoy here, but in the end that's entirely their loss. One greasy thumb up for The Loveless!
Kathryn Bigelow's debut is a cheap mimicry of the 50s road picture. In his first ever starring role, even the reliable Willem Dafoe disappoints. Take a look at the full review here: 366movies.com/2012/10/16/270loveless/
