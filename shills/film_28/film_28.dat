who cares?
Now I know where Aronofsky's mother! inspiration came from. Like in mother!, the guests overstayed their welcome, and slowly invaded the host's privacy.
It doesn't get that rating because I liked it... it gets it because it totally accomplishes what it sets out to do. Its executed to near perfection. The only part I hate is the ending where they rewind back. Nope, not going to accept that... she killed him and thats that. The plot is obviously disturbing and cruel. As its meant to be. There is some caution taken ie they dont kill the kid on-screen, nor do they show the father being stabbed. The acting is great as you truly feel sorry for the protagonists and you thoroughly hate the antagonists. Not much more I want to say about this film. It really pissed me off, so congratulations, mission accomplished.
Trash. Don't recommend.
"I am extremely scared of physical violence" -Michael Haneke It's crazy how someone very opposed to physical violence would create one of the greatest commentaries of the glorification of it in media. Being a guy who is into over exaggerated violence I realize that this film was made to speak to me. All off camera events are the events a typical sadistic film would include at great detail. Here Haneke details the things surrounding the actual acts of violence. The 4th wall breaking is so good and shows how the sadistic killers are in control of the film similar to how sadistic viewers of movies are in control of what kind of movies get made. It's all about supply and demand. Lot of super great meta commentary that is a stern pushback to violence in media.
Fucking cunts... That was not a funny game! üò§  So this is a critique of society‚Äôs weird love-hate relationship with violence? The reason I assume this is because we aren‚Äôt shown anything too graphic yet we stayed till the end and put up with the violence in hopes of witnessing a satisfying ending where immorality is trumped. Additionally, whenever Paul broke the 4th wall we‚Äôre forced to accept that we‚Äôre complicit in the violence and the rewind scene encapsulates the overall message that we have the option to switch off/avoid violence yet we probably won‚Äôt do so. Aside from Haneke I can‚Äôt think of anyone else who executes (pun intended) an idea so, consistently, well ‚Äì he does a great job of forcing the audience to spectate and evaluate.
5x5 - Directors challenge: Haneke The film starts with a tracking shot of a car, where a happy family plays name that tune with classical music. This classical music is jarringly interrupted by screaming death metal. This foreshadowing might be understated compared to what happens in the film. While I am not a fan of this type of hostage situation, helpless victim type of film. Haneke, the director, did have a few things going for him that held my interest. First of all, he pushes the action far beyond what you would expect from your typical motion picture. He definitely does not pull any punches. We also see the film held up as a masochistic mirror to the audience. At a couple of moments the lead kidnapper looks directly into the camera as if to say ‚Äúyou guys like this? Ok, I‚Äôll keep going.‚Äù The first time he does it he literally winks at the camera. Haneke seems to be torturing the audience as well, giving us hope only to take it away in a surreal moment towards the end. While this particular film would be added to my list of ‚Äúone-timers‚Äù, there is enough going on that makes me interested and a little excited to venture further into Haneke‚Äôs catalogue.
It doesn't need to show the violence to be sinister nor in a way disturbing. We know what's happening. Also loved the 4th wall breaking. Did it have a good ending? Well, it depends on which one did you bet on, I guess. I won mine.
This is an horror movie, no question. The level of tension we feel throughout the film is painful. It's not gory, there is no jump scare but still it is incredible how bad you feel at the end of it. A masterpiece. Some scenes are fairly slow with the intention to let us absorb the absurdity of the situation.
MICHAEL HANEKE SIR ARE YOU OK?
‚ÄúHe‚Äôs a spoiled little shithead, tormented by ennui and world-weariness, weighed down by the emptiness of existence.‚Äù  A visercal attack on anyone willing to view it. I really admire what Haneke does here. It‚Äôs not pretty, but the content presented is important for us to digest. Why do we want to watch this? Haneke implicates us in being privy to the violence presented onscreen; which doesn‚Äôt feel good whatsoever. What‚Äôs even more uncomfortable is that he does so in a way that‚Äôs quite tongue and cheek. However as I said, it‚Äôs important we reckon with the inner workings of how media violence can mold and desensitize our psyche. What‚Äôs the point of it? There isn‚Äôt one. But that‚Äôs the point. Frankly, I think Pasolini‚Äôs Sal√≥ does what Funny Games does a lot better, but that‚Äôs just me. This film sees Haneke at his most nihilistic, which says a lot actually. An experience you won‚Äôt soon forget.
I probably didn‚Äôt need¬†to watch both versions of this but I‚Äôm still glad I did
Wow I heard so much about this film. A creepy sinister film ... now I gotta see the remake
once you set up the two side and make enough tension, then just play with the tension: accidents, however trivial is fine. It is like a child throwing his temper for no reason. Whatever happens, the next event is doomed to happen. The music and sound tells you what is going on. Only the broadest stuff is shown. That's stylist and even a bit weird. The weirdness is all what is pursued in a suspense movie. All the elements that are unsettling count. This could be the first movie that I can't take anymore. It is so close to reality. The men, the setting and everything. I guess that's where I should go further to
82 Had I not seen the American remake (also directed by Haneke) this would be rated higher. It was almost a weird kinda d√©j√† vu seeing this version be pretty much beat for beat the same exact film with a different cast. This is scarier than most horrors because this is one of the more believable and realistic scary scenarios. To have two complete strangers forcefully invade their way into your home and psychologically torment you with all intentions to eventually kill you is terrifying. Especially when they look completely normal and harmless otherwise. The abrupt use of heavy metal over the opening credits was a genius move and really prepared you for the chaos that's to come from a peaceful getaway. Enjoyed how the movie ends as a loop, bringing them right to the door of their next victims. Also breaking the fourth wall is something I usually can't stand but it really works here. I definitely suggest seeing it if you haven't seen the remake, but it's pretty much the same film so you could go with either one.
This movie was dope. I was like :O the whole time, also it‚Äôs so funny that the director remade his own movie
For months this has been sitting in my Filmstruck watchlist and for months I thought this Austrian film starred Antonio Bandaras?¬† BUT WOW WHAT A MOVIE WHERES THE REMOTE
An uncompromising commentary on violence in media that pulls no punches in confronting and frustrating it's audience.
ok this shit fucked me up in a few different ways. so gripping and intense
IF YOU ARE A FAN OF HORROR IS ANY WAY YOU HAVE TO WATCH THIS!!!!!!!!!!!!! This is easily the best horror I‚Äôve seen, the fact the film is so realistic add an extra layer of brutality absent from most horror films¬† My favorite part of the film though is how it criticizes people who watch horror in the first place, saying they get the same type of pleasure out of watching people being tortured/killed as the killers doing it¬† It expresses this idea in many ways (becoming more obvious towards the end) but I think the cleverest is through its forth wall breaking which is only done by the killer, imply that he‚Äôs torturing this family for the audiences pleasure¬† Needless to say it‚Äôs some heavy shit
This is a very cruel film. That‚Äôs the only way I can think to describe it. I think Haneke is a brilliant director. He gets fantastic performances in every film I‚Äôve seen of his so far. His use of sound is so carefully and thoughtfully constructed (eg the refrigerator‚Äôs hum coming and going, which not only dramatically punctuates many moments but also roots it in a reality as many these kind of details would be ignored in most films). I love his shot choices; how they are framed, the lighting choices, how every single one is paced, etc. The efficacy of his films is undeniable. He is clearly fascinated by our relationship to what we see on screen and I think he truly considers all the complexities of this matter. This is all leading to one big BUUUUUUUUUUUUT: From what I have seen through his films and interviews (though admittedly it is not a large amount), I have many issues with his absolute morals. I think he believes he is somewhat of the arbiter of morality in cinema, which has lead him to be partially incapable of any self-reflection. The man has murdered multiple animals for his films, and I believe can be somewhat hypocritical to his own moral axioms in regards to the viewers relationship with the screen. Ultimately I want to watch more of Haneke‚Äôs work because I think he is clearly a brilliantly skilled filmmaker and I think there is a lot to learn from him. But I would implore him (not that he will ever read this mind you, but still) to revaluate his beliefs and lead him to more empathetic filmmaking.¬† That is not to say you can‚Äôt make grotesque films, I think Naked is in many ways a horrible viewing experience, but I can tell it is rooted in empathy and is not as entrenched in stern absolutist morals (or perhaps a-morals).
HAD to watch this 4 uni and worked myself up so much thinking it would be disgusting but, compared 2 my expectations, it like wasn't that bad? it was horrific in how real and how slow it was, it was very self aware which doesn't rlly make up for being quite boring . maybe not fleshing anyone out enough, u feel the visceral pain of the family but u dnt really know any of them enough to really care and vouch for them . well made and horrible i'm glad i've watched it so boys can stop telling me 2 watch it
I watched the remake of this first and they‚Äôre both great films but this just got under my skin on a different level üßêüßê‚ÄºÔ∏è‚ÄºÔ∏èüö´üß¢üîúüí∞üí∞
Just... just watch it...
First off, bonus points to Michael Haneke for being the first repeat director in this series. When you hear that a movie breaks the fourth wall or is self aware, you probably think of Deadpool or something else like that. The last emotion you probably associate with a fourth wall break is fear. Yet, somehow, Haneke makes it terrifying. This film is one of the most scary movies I have ever seen. And no jump scares required, in fact, it's quite slow at times. To the effect of being gut-wrenchingly intense and filled with what I can only refer to as soul horror. It isn't startling, it doesn't just scare you and let you walk off, it digs deep into you and absolutely disturbs your very essence. Sound fun? Well, it isn't, and that's great (considering what Haneke's intentions are). This film is a ruthless meditation on violence in fiction, and how deep down, inside, everyone has a bloodlust for what's on the screen. Instead of just indulging in that, though, "Funny Games" twists it into a truer version of itself. Violence on screen just becomes violence. It's completely brilliant. And I'll never sleep again.
This movie was pretty tense and pretty interesting. The acting was really well done, but I was bored a lot while watching this. I wasn't a huge fan of the whole thing, but it tackled violence in entertainment in a really fascinating way.
The shot of the blood splatter on the TV *chef‚Äôs kiss* Cinema
Funny Games is a brilliant exploration of violence in film as ‚Äòentertajnment‚Äô. There are a lot of negative responses to this movie and I think it boils down to two things: 1. Haneke is undoubtedly confronting the viewer with why we find violence entertaining, while offering up a violent film. Some find this preachy, a little ‚Äòhave your cake and eat it to‚Äô. 2. Due to the sadistically cruel and aloof villains, who are detached to the extreme from the pain they are inflicting, the whole thing can feel like an exercise in nihilism. Most do not respond well to nihilism. Personally, I did not find the film preachy at all, but I do not typically find torture/horror films fun so perhaps I felt like Hanekes finger wasn‚Äôt pointing directly at me. Even if I were in to that type of film, I still think Funny Games is not so much accusatory of the audience as it is curious. Curious about why these types of films can be entertaining. I also do not think the film is nihilistic though I can definitely understand that interpretation.
we all know the moral point haneke was making, it's valid, he definitely didn't need to remake the movie in english to rub it in more, but! it's not about that. it's about that 10 minute long scene of susanne lothar just registering the death of her son, that scene is absolutely horrific and masterful.
I don't remember being this pissed at the guys when I watched the 2007 version of the movie.
Second Haneke film, the first one being The Piano Teacher (which was his international hit), and this one is the first hit that gave him a cult following. Anyone who's seen this movie, or even read the plot synopsis, can see why this stood out. This film makes me feel like The Piano Teacher was tame in comparison. This film is the definition of bleak. From the plot to the cinematography (which is great despite being largely gray in its color scheme) to the incredible performances all around (including the child actor). Considering the messages this film gives about our fascination with violence, I'm now very interested in watching the remake
As always, Michael Haneke indulges in sadism, all for the sake of a didactic message. No amount of mean-spirited narrative tricks and stern moralizing, however, can guise the hypocrisy festering underneath: he "critiques" (I use this word liberally) the immorality of horror films, yet takes immense pleasure in the physical and psychological torture of his characters. Unbelievable; what solipsism this reveals. A fraudulent film from one of the world's most disingenuous filmmakers.
Mixed feelings. Definitely stomach turning at points and I like the question ‚Äùwhy watch violent movies (torture pieces) at all?‚Äù, it just seems somewhat heavy handed and one sided.¬† Props to Haneke for not sacrificing artistic merit and skill for the cause though. The acting and directing is superb, as well as Bonehead of course.
This feels like a giant homage to the ‚ÄúSinging in the Rain‚Äù scene from A Clockwork Orange. Except this is less fantastical and cartoonish, and more grim and realistic.¬†The film restraints itself in showing its horrific details, and when it eventually does show something it makes it more powerful that it would‚Äôve been. Their is one scene in which the intruders have left; and the camera just lingers there. You see a man breakdown into tears and it‚Äôs horrifically beautiful.¬† The acting from everyone is fantastic. It‚Äôs very tense and the pacing is perfect. From beginning to end, there was an great uneasy feeling in my stomach. It‚Äôs not easy to digest, but I loved every minute. All in all, it‚Äôs fantastic.
what's the point? please donate to my gofundme to get lanthimos and haneke into therapy together so they can explore their familial shortcomings and their irrational disdain of dogs.
Haneke got fed up with your bullshit
Michael Haneke‚Äôs original stunner is a harrowing indictment of human complacency in a world of commercialized violence. A film you will never forget.
Has so much going for it but hella points docked for the meta shit
Still wondering why I watched this entire movie. Don‚Äôt waste your time.
fourth wall breaks? german heavy metal? me being confused? my mom walking in during a torture scene and looking at me like i‚Äôm a sociopath? this is my kind of movie
Fuck you Michael Haneke. One of my absolute favourite directors once again proves to be a challenging storyteller in this cruel thriller. The performances by the cast were fantastic, full of emotions and intensity that is absolutely exciting to watch and definitely pulls you into the film. The brilliant screenplay and direction by Haneke is masterful in it's implict portrayal of violence and how the story toys with audience expectations as well as defying many genre conventions. The cinematography of this film was as brilliant as the other films I have watched, but the cold tone of the style definitely seemed to lend itself well with the story. It was really interesting experiencing how radical and unique this film is compared to the other Haneke films I have seen, specifically the liberties he took through the narrative. I definitely missed watching a Haneke film after the (somewhat) disappointing Happy End. I can't wait to explore more of this asshole's work (I mean that in the most loving way).
Fairly insufferable.
Although I thought the meta commentary was a tad muddled in spots, this was a thrilling watch from start to finish!
This is pretty much just Haneke criticizing you for wanting to watch this movie. I don't know to what degree it's self aware but I also don't care. The title is ironic to an extent but I do feel like this is just a pitch black comedy. Once the movie goes full on meta at the end, the horror and thriller elements are all gone and we're just watching what's left of a comedy. The conversation the two dudes have at the end about multiple universes and outcomes or something was kind of interesting. The reverse-colored credits was a cool artistic choice. I love the restrain and control that is shown through the closeups. The audience is endlessly manipulated through Haneke's corruption of tropes. He takes hollow characters with no nuance and uses that as his starting point. The film itself is extremely sadistic towards its audience. The arrogant and borderline pretentious attitude throughout the film didn't bother me and I felt that it was very fitting. To everyone who said the games weren't funny, yes they are.
Minus a half star for making me feel like a horrible human being. Horror movies thrill us because we can witness the high stakes from the comfort of our own home or theater seat. Enjoy the ride with no personal investment or risk. Horror fans get a spike of adrenaline on gruesome gore and deaths. And there are plenty of great horror filmmakers that tap into those emotions and drag us along for the ride, saying "Isn't this fun!!" And we all go "Yayyyy!" Then Michael Haenke comes along. And says, "Oh, you like all this senseless violence? Let's roll..." And what comes next is an onslaught of discomfort, that subverts the rules, your expectations, and the normal joy you would get from from those highs of a good evisceration. The first clue is the title card. A well-to-do family driving to their country house with their boat in tow, quaintly playing a guessing game of listening to opera and guessing the piece and composer. The title appears, and we are assaulted with speed punk. This is not going to end well. They are visited by two clean cut boys who proceed to psychologically - and then physically - abuse the family. All is well in the universe of filmdom. Eli Roth made a mint on this kind of stuff. Then, one of the boys breaks the 4th wall and winks into the camera. Oh shit -- we are now a participant...invited into the film...on the side of the bad guys. "You wanted to see some violence? Come sit down next to us." To add insult to injury, Haenke never really gives us the satisfaction of a knife cutting open skin, beatings, baring of flesh, gunshots -- all the trappings of staple horror and exploitation. Everything is kept just off camera as we imagine what is happening, or on the edge of our seat waiting for something to happen. And finally, when we've had enough, and Haenke gives us our long awaited blast of on-screen violence, he inconceivably and immediately strips us of our joy. "Oh, you think you can relish in the kind of violence you were expecting? Because that violence is "better" than the stuff I've already been subjecting you to? No....no, I don't think so. In fact, I'm going to make you wallow in your shame for the next 10 minutes." And by the end Haenke looks at us and says, "You're still here? After everything I've put you through? Well -- you're exactly the kind of person that needed to experience this. Now, go to your room and think about what you've done." Every moment of this film is a tactical manipulation of the audience; a commentary on society's ambivalence to and even celebration of violence. Natural Born Killers attempted this but got caught in the cycle of showing the effect of violence in the media by showing violence in media. Haenke deconstructs it into its parts, and then removes the pieces that give us that thrill, and then presents it back to us as a plateful of dread and despair. This is obviously not for everyone. But it is filmmaking in its finest form. It achieves exactly what it sets out to do, which is to reflect back on us who we are. And Haenke isn't going to give us an answer to our questions -- or a reprieve. I have not seen the 2007 remake. I don't think my soul can handle another screening.
This movie is a work of art. It's definitely not for everyone, but every decision Michael Haneke made while crafting this film was the correct one, and it all shows on screen. I don't wanna go into too many details because I don't want to mark this as a spoiler review, but a couple of vague notes: 1. The period from 65 minutes to 76 minutes is one of the single greatest scenes in movie history. 2. A lot of the moment to moment minutiae of this movie was not what I expected. 3. Arno Frisch is stupendous.
Hoop-Tober #29 This ain't my first Hanneke but it feels like that. I saw The White Ribbon two years ago and clearly I was very young to appreciate it and I was so bored with that film, but I am really sure that if I rewatch it now I will like it much more. Funny Games was exactly what I expected it to be and better. It is a small, horror that really brings it home. It is claustrophobic and intense as fuck. I mean we from the one scene to the other and I was shaking. Trembling! It is a film, a horror taht is really intense and you feel like you are sweating with the characters. Like you are unsure about your life like them. I loved that. Haneke's simple but effective direction really is the something else. He will put his camera still and let a scene play without cutting and that what makes you feel so much. It seems like it is playing out in front of your eyes. He would let one cut last for minutes with almost zero movement of the camera and that really added to the film. The acting is top notch. While they all are almost unknown. Everyone gives a damn amazing performance. They are all so real and so subtle. Not one tries to be huge or have that one big scene and that was what made this so great too. This was just a thrill ride. It takes you through so many levels physically and mentally and it asks questions too. A Damn that ending!!!...
The Strangers but good
HoopTober5.0 - film #27 About 20 minutes in, it starts to feel uncomfortable. It only gets worse from there. This is not an easy film. It subverts so many of the things that excite us in horror movies, or just movies in general, and twists them into the worst, most uncomfortable things. There‚Äôs one moment when you think that the tide is changing, when you think that you will get some reprieve, and the way it takes it away from you is so nuts that you feel nothing but helpless. And it turns on you and asks if you‚Äôve had enough. It is a film more people should watch, though they might not want to. It will make you question the easy violence that has pervaded our society through movies. We thrive on thrills and violence and this will make you question if that is okay. Not for everyone, but this is a horror film with a message that we should probably listen to.
This film is torturing the audience just as much as it is torturing the actual characters of the film. It's hard to be sadist without being explicit. Usually being explicit is the safest way to get a shock out of the audience. Yet here I am thinking this is probably one of the most sadist and macabre film I've seen in so long and almost nothing was shown. This is what we wanted, this is what we get; there'd be nothing to watch otherwise
is it weird that i liked this better than the 2007 remake even though they‚Äôre literally the same movie? ü§î
I‚Äôve never enjoyed the first act of a movie and then hated the rest of the it so much.
Haneke probably thinks he is smart with his meta-commentary, but that doesn't legitimize the very existence of this film! FUNNY GAMES tries to purposefully bore you out of your skull just to get some stupid point across. It's nothing but a bad joke.
The fourth wall breaking in this *chef kiss*
How well is your satire supposed to work if you assume that your audience isn't in on the joke? Does it not make sense that the audience, upon learning that a film is a satire, or at the very least, attempting to be subversive, would expect it to do or be exactly that? Can you honestly expect to use the metanarrative to counteract the audience's supposed desensitization towards violence when the violence in question occurs off-screen? Or are you then relying on your audience to be composed of the kind of people who would already be inclined to sensationalize violence and somehow not know? Who exactly does Michael Haneke think is watching his films? I'm not asking you to answer these questions, or even to imply that these questions have answers. They're more there to highlight what I think is the fundamental reason Funny Games doesn't work for me. Haneke is a talented and meticulous director, and he gets incredibly raw and vulnerable performances out of actors. I would never start a queue to debate that assumption, but I think I've finally realized why the only ones among his filmography to actually shock me are the ones that aren't trying to make me look like an idiot. If he wants to spend millions of dollars making films just to call me a hypocrite, that's fine. More power to him to do what he wants with his creative vision, but he has to prove that I'm a hypocrite first. Funny Games is the cinematic equivalent of the "begging the question" fallacy, assuming the truth of the conclusion instead of supporting it. (Low) 6 / 10 - Decent
Not to be the fashion police or anything, but that outfit she put on during the phone drying scene was awful.
This movie is strongest when the boys are on screen, Family acts well, but they don't drive the narrative. Paul is just a menace and I love it. There is actually a surprisingly low amount of violence and gore, but the psychological torture is all the more taxing.
A well-directed, well-acted, disturbing experience that I will never watch again.
Halloween horror-thon night 24: There was nothing funny about this
Hooptober 5.0 #25 of 31 Definitely one of the most horrifying films yet. Holy #%@! at the sandwich scene and bag-over-head scene. The first time he breaks the 4th wall, I freaked (and we're all just ok with that TV remote??). The long takes were fantastic and the actors all did a really lovely and subdued job. The very last moment of the film was the perfect hook. I love when you get a final twist like that and it leaves you in such fear. As well made a film as I think it is, I never want to see this again. Oh wait, I have to tomorrow...@FunnyGames2007
Michael Haneke's brutal take on the home invasion sub-genre gives a nod, a wink, and a quick breaking of the fourth wall to try and make the viewer feel complicit. Depending on your point-of-view either the audience is being mocked or the joke is on Haneke himself for directing a cynical and deeply unpleasant film to make a rather well-worn point about the depiction of violence. Perhaps it's both.
that rewind section was the most tacky shit i've ever seen
A brutal home invasion film, that explores the relationship the viewer has with violence in film. The film toys with us, it's main antagonist addressing the audience directly. It sure is making a statement about the respinsibility of the filmmaker. While disturbing, it also doesn't show nearly as much as other films of the same topics or genre. The filmmaking is well executed, and while the story isn't original and sometimes silly, the film uses it to it's advantage by playing upon the conventions established in film and the genre in order to critique the audience members. It is a must watch for those interested in the ethics of cinema.
when the xavier dolan look-alike took those bullets and said ¬´one for beavis, one for butt-head¬ª i was shaking and laughing at the same time... this film is amazing
‚ÄúYou're on their side, aren't you? So, who will you bet with?‚Äù The Good: Arno Frisch is so terrifyingly charismatic in Funny Games (1997), he reels you in with his charm just to break your trust with these heinous acts. I feel like his character is the perfect embodiment of the critiques on violence and media. All of the other performances are also very well done.¬† Funny Games (1997) is one of the most suspenseful and risky films I‚Äôve ever seen. It never holds back, it‚Äôs completely bleak and terrifying. Funny Games (1997) keeps its tone the whole film, there‚Äôs barely a sliver hope within this whole film.¬† While I don‚Äôt think his style was fully formed at this point, Micheal Haneke is still an unstoppable force directorial-wise. I absolutely love how gut wrenching and risky this film is in delivering its themes.¬† The Bad: There is a twenty minute scene in Funny Games (1997) that completely stops the films films beautifully slow pace. It feels so out of place, I completely understand what was being attempted, it just wasn‚Äôt very well done. Funny Games (1997) is often very bland looking. I just felt like the film didn‚Äôt have that interesting of framing, I feel like there is so much potential with these characters and this story. Also, I‚Äôm going to see Funny Games (2007) very soon. Fun Fact: Director Michael Haneke has said that he never intended Funny Games to be a horror film. Instead his idea was to make a film with a moralistic comment about the influence of media violence on society. It's a subject that Haneke is quite passionate about. 84/100 Would Recommend!
‚ÄúBut I think I just cannot stand to see violence in any way [‚Ä¶] Why do we stand still on the motorway when an accident has happened? [‚Ä¶] Looking at horrible situations is so fascinating because the spectator is not directly concerned.‚Äù ‚Äì from an interview with Michael Haneke In the opening of Michael Haneke‚Äòs 1997 Funny Games (and his shot-for-shot American remake ten years later), a bourgeois family of three is driving up to their summer home against the tranquility of classical music on the radio. We have no more than glimpsed the family grouped together in a shot before we are aurally assaulted with deafening black metal and the film‚Äôs blood red title card. This shocking, subversive intro sets the mood of the rest of the film, informing the audience from the very beginning that this won‚Äôt be a pleasant vacation for this family. Funny Games‚Äô premise is deceptively recognizable for any fan of the home invasion horror subgenre. Two young men, Peter (Frank Giering) and Paul (Arno Frisch), politely invite themselves into the home of the affluent George (Ulrich Muhe), Anna (Susanne Lothar), and George Jr. (Stefan Clapczynski), before forcing the family to engage in sick, torturous ‚Äúgames‚Äù. Why are they doing this? ‚ÄúWhy not?‚Äù, Paul earnestly insists, and that‚Äôs about as close of an answer within the narrative as we‚Äôre given. READ THE FULL REVIEW ON CINECCENTRIC
what a bold, interesting, and refreshing movie... the ending blew my mind... italian chef kiss
i first saw the english version like 10 years ago after getting really stoned for one of the first times in my life. afterwards we ordered like 4 pizzas and ate everything in this kid‚Äôs parents‚Äô cabinets. funny games indeed!!

first Haneke film and I loved it. cant wait to see more from this dude.
SHOCTOBER 9 i had to watch this in parts bc it fucked me up so much
Funny Games is far from being the most extreme or violent film of the 1990s. But it ranks quite high because of its influence, including the theme of torture, and bringing the viewer vicariously into an extremely horrific experience. There are also scenes where the killers are speaking directly into the camera. For any horror fan wanting more than just gore, this brings you into the same house as the victims, yet you‚Äôre powerless to do anything but watch. Director Michael Haneke takes a different route, displaying contempt for his audience. Funny Games features the now infamous scene where the two all-white-wearing psycho-kidnappers even have the power to turn back time, in one of the most excruciatingly-maddening scenes ever put on film. We watch as an entire family is psychologically, as well as physically, tortured in their own home. Michael Haneke did the American remake 10 years later nearly shot-for-shot with an English-speaking cast. While neither version of the film is as violent or graphic as other horror films created by lesser directors, its extreme nature and no-way-out tone is more psychologically damaging and long-lasting overall. Haneke is in no way a horror director, and reportedly this film was his response to violence being shown on screen in a fun and/or vicarious way. He is quoted as saying ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt really want to be part of this violence pornography of the mass media.‚Äù Regardless of why it was made, Funny Games contributed in a major part to extreme cinema and its sub-genres: home invasion and torture porn.
We're at a big loss as a society due to the fact that Michael Haneke doesn't make more horror movies. I mean, maybe he makes social-commentary dramas out of goodwill: knowing that if he were to tread into the horror genre, he would leave everyone else biting his dust. Funny Games is a masterclass in suspense and terror. Not horror - terror. The pacing, the foreshadowing, the imagery, all mingles and meshes in an unforgettable finale. Haneke is like a sadistic fisherman and we are the gullible and stupidly hopeful fish: we latch on to every single piece of bait he throws us. Funny Games is terrifying: it's cold and sadistic and inhumane and - most scary of all - helpless. A damn good movie.
Duuuuuuude....i give no shits about your stupid college psychology thesis.
Hooptober 5.0 Film #9 TASK #2: Six countries! With this film and its equally effective shot-for-shot U.S. remake, writer and director Michael Haneke proves himself a master at subverting his audience's expectations with such sick and twisted reckless abandon and joy, resulting in Funny Games delivering an experience that's terrifying in its subtlety.
I've always had an affinity for movies that make me feel like shit. A quick peruse through the list of my favorite films reveals there's some pretty depraved stuff in there. Gaspar Noe is my second favorite director, for god's sake. Funny Games has officially joined that canon of incredible movies that make me feel like human garbage for watching them. The films comes across more like a social experiment, pushing the limits of what its audience will endure with a wicked, fourth-wall-breaking smile. Haneke has truly been able to create the most torturous viewing experience I've ever seen.¬†It exists in a world unmediated by goodness or fortune, where pure evil has full and unbridled reign to make *literally* anything happen. It's a film that captures the same unstoppable evil that Ari Aster's Hereditary attempted to represent. Sure, this movie is pretentious as fuck and the social experimental aspects of it might really turn some people off, but if you buy into the premise like I did, it can make for a sickeningly brilliant viewing experience. A funny game, indeed.
31 Days of Halloween Day 14: Funny Games A simple premise; a family goes to their lake house for a little getaway and are subsequently tormented and murdered. Why? Well, that's difficult to pin down. This film is really all about violence for the sake of violence. The killers tell lie after lie about their motives and origins but at the end of the day, none of that matters. The tension starts almost immediately with a nervous young man asking for eggs. Events escalate quickly. Surprisingly, their is very little on screen violence, even nudity is off camera, but we are left with the aftermath of the violence. There is one very long shot in the middle of this film that just goes on and on. It's absolutely harrowing. You really get a sense of what these people are going through and try to imagine how they can possibly go on and function to survive. The one attacker who does most of the talking has a habit of breaking the fourth wall, which is a bit jarring at first but then he does something else and talking to the audience doesn't seem so crazy after all. There's a discussion between the two killers at the end of the film which really sums up this film nicely. You could also just see this as part of the killers insanity, as only he does any of this, maybe he is crazy and talks to an imaginary audience. It's a clever film, it's brutal and funny and I would definitely recommend, 5/5 üéÉüéÉüéÉüéÉüéÉ.
Deadpool 3: Ultimate Rewind I'm guessing most people will either love or hate the gimmick. But I dont know, seems pretty lame and unnecessary. Also it looks like they killed that dog for real. So, fuck this movie
The absolute definition of INTENSE. All white clothes. Maybe a tribute to the droogs and the old ultra violence?
Hoop-Tober 5.0 Film #16 of 34. My list is here. There isn't a film I can think of where a fourth wall break has improved the narrative. It's amateurish and cringeworthy. It is taken to a ridiculous extreme here. I understand the intention. I just think it's laughable. There are no likeable characters in this film. There is nothing inherently unlikable about the family, but there is nothing much to relate to about them either. I was expecting much more from this. I usually really love extreme cinema. Not that this was all that extreme, but I found this to be empty and aimless. How on Earth did this warrant a remake? Why on Earth does everyone like this so much? Hanake is clearly making an uninformed and naive statement about violence here. The argument that by watching we are made complicit in the torture is just not true. The effects model of audience reception is outdated and ignores the complexities of spectator response. So, what he's actually done is just made a really bad film. A film whose only message is that people should feel guilty for watching it. I didn't feel guilty. I just felt patronised. His method of alignment with the killers (the fourth wall break) is so poor that even the films intended purpose comes off as childish. I was not impressed, but I'll give it an extra half a star for the opening credit music.
I only knew the remake so far. Although I don't like German films, the original was actually much better. Very oppressive.
It‚Äôs still stressful even in German
Showed my girlfriend this because I loved it so much and now she's not talking to me because she blames me for how horrible the bad men were to the dog.
The movie that says onscreen suffering is for our enjoyment takes the joy out of onscreen suffering.  Cool.
Halloween Horror Challenge 12/31 I did not expect this film to have such an effect on me the way it did. In the space of its runtime I went from curiosity to pure amazement to absolute boredom to somewhat satisfied. The first act is fantastic in building up suspension and making you feel uneasy. The long take shots were really impressive and really added to the uncertainty of the scenes. This part of the movie had me hooked. The second act starts with a bang that was so well executed that I couldn‚Äôt wait to see what happened next. Except nothing did. It became slow and boring and the long shots started to overstay their welcome. I understand what the film makers were going for but I think they took it a step too far. The final act picks up the pace once again but for me the momentum was ruined. I could no longer love this movie the same. The ending wa great but the second act left such a poor taste in mouth. Despite this I can‚Äôt deny this was a good film that was extremely well made. The great acting and brilliant use of the fourth wall are also note worthy too.
