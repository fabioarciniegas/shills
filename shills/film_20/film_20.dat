One star for Jimmy Stewart as a stalker. One star for Kim Novak’s dual roles.  One star for Alfred Hitchcock’s direction.  But the real two stars are Robert Burke’s gorgeous photography and Bernard Herrmann’s haunting score.
I was thinking about how I’ve never seen jimmy stewart play a villain. While most probably wouldn’t consider him such in vertigo, I mostly see him as a tragic and manipulative creep. Though of course he himself was manipulated. I can’t shake his callousness towards Midge. Novak’s dynamic performance is quite astounding, and I cant justify her death, didn’t seem to be a narrative necessity - one of the many markers of sexism rife throughout this movie. Dated? Most definitely. Masterpiece? I can see the argument.
"If I let you change me, will that do it? If I do what you tell me, will you love me?"
here was a tremendous amount of worry that the hype of this film would kill the ultimate effect of watching it. These worries proved to be unfounded. Nothing I can say can describe this appropriately. I'm not even sure what it is, but we just felt it. The film builds, and Hitchcock already a master of long set up, allows for the uncomfortable and unusual to to simmer. Just eerie feelings crawl along your spine throughout, and it only gets creepier as it becomes more obsessive. It's a picture perfect film with ultimately no release, abandon your belief in resolution, you won't find it here.
I screened Vertigo for a big group of friends and this thing, I kid you not, put every single one of ‘em to sleep. Out cold. And I know what you’re gonna say: “C-dog, you need to get yourself some new friends,” and you’re probably right, but you know what? I gotta say, this film isn’t as accessible as I remember. Look, I love Vertigo. People like us all do. There’s just something about the way it feels that really gets our motors purring. That rich VistaVision. Herrmann’s sumptuous score (in my opinion, the greatest achievement of his brilliant career). Stewart’s uncharacteristically demented performance. The haunting, dreamlike spell that permeates nearly every frame. The film is a technical wonder, practically unrivalled. We all know this. But when was the last time you watched Sight & Sound’s Greatest Film of All Time® with a bunch of normies? I’m not talking about some arthouse retrospective with like-minded cinephiles, or an in-the-mood, masturbatory solo viewing, I mean normal people, that is to say, people who couldn’t give two shits about dolly zooms, mise-en-scene, or idealogical editing. Watching this with the pressure of a casual audience, trying to defend the film’s goofier aspects, is an exhausting experience, let me tell you. The abominable way women are treated, that ridiculous stepping stool scene, the awkward blocking of Stewart’s hilariously inept shadowing, the abundance of lousy rear projection, the pathetic suicide attempt into the bay, Midge’s lopsided arc (which could’ve been tidily wrapped up if it had been her at the tower instead of some random nun), all the way through to that (and I’m sorry to have to put it this way, but) just-plain-stupid final scene. Go ahead. Skip ahead to that final minute and look me in the eyes and tell me that works for you. Honestly, I was kinda glad no one else was awake to see it!  And speaking of honesty, can we all just admit that it never quite plunges into the dark psychological depths its champions proclaim? Hitch is painting with pretty broad strokes as far as actual medical science is concerned. Sure, there are some interesting themes dealing with possession, guilt, lust, artificiality, etc., and you could analyze them to high hell (as every armchair-psychologist film critic has), but beyond the masterful way these elements are utilized to craft beautifully-staged cinematic sequences, I don’t think you’ll find a chapter dedicated to Vertigo in any clinical texts. Anyway, I guess what it all boils down to is this: the next time I host a Hitchcock screening, we’re watching The Birds. It may not be Hitch’s finest hour, but it sure as hell won’t put ‘em all to sleep.
It’s amazing, sure, but I cannot get past the opening sequence with his face and all the trippy colours.
Alfred Hitchcock's Vertigo is a timeless classic. It has a fantastic script, that tells a great story, with some excellent twists and turns. The great James Stewart puts in some very strong work in the lead role and Kim Novak is really good too. The sets deign is another plus and the cinematography is excellent. It also has one of the all time great scores, courtesy of Bernard Herrmann. 9/10
You know, the Chinese say that once you've saved a person's life, you're responsible for it forever.  Beautifuly crafted Film everything acting, directing, camera movements and the amazing camera shots just amazing. This film almost got a 5/5 but the ending ruined it for me. If Alfred ended the Film where she changed her clothes in the Empire Hotel apartment and then she and Scottie kissed that wouldve been better but i do see why he did not end it there to show the audience that he Scottie finally faced and defeated his fear of Heights aka Acrophobia and the gulit that was within him bout Madeleine death. But if he did actually end it at the Empire Hotel that wouldve been Beautifuly-Fucked up both of em living a lie but a beautiful one.
on the more enjoyable end of movies before the 60s!
Enough has been said about this film, but I still find new things every time I watch it. Richness. Mystery. San Francisco. Characters and traumas tied to places. Ghosts. Production design. Kim Novak is so good.
The tragedy of Vertigo is that, for all its strength in theme, it is still crippled by Hitchcock's adherence to parlor tricks and poor handling of emotion. Alfred is famously quoted as saying "actors should be treated like cattle," but one needn't watch more than a few of his films to realize that when he says "actors" he means "people." Characters, storytelling, audience responses, even the human soul are all subsumed into a kind of press that turns everything two-dimensional. This is all well and good, but if people are going to behave like machines, they need to be extraordinary machines, with exaggerated, caricaturesque aspects to offset their unreality. They should be supernormal as opposed to subnormal. Everything in Vertigo, beyond its surface, is quite subnormal. Characters are constantly telling you little more than what is happening on screen; they fall in love and off buildings due to contrivances; they have no real backstories; they are only chess pieces but not even interesting ones. "Well," one might say, "but that is the point! Hitchcock captures how everything, right down to our very relations, has been steamrolled into artifice, and we are left with nothing but our reamed-out biological vestiges to make sense of anything now!" and they would be right. The issue is not with Vertigo's themes nor anything adjacent, but in the deployment of said themes. That all the meaning in your life could be trompe-l'œil is not well communicated by the fact most of the meaning in the film is itself a diegetic trompe-l'œil, a kind of petty, plotted conceit that had little to do with the themes at heart here. Hallucinations can be medicated, illusions dispelled, but the greatest mirage of all, that life could be somehow meaningful and there are people in it whom you can save, is far better illustrated in the film's first half than its second, where its shallowness and lameness are fully disrobed. Falling in love with the vessel of a dead woman, whilst the soul of the living woman whose body you are in love with is inaccessible to you, is an infinitely more damning illustration of life because it elevates the deception to an ontological level, rather than a mere scam enacted for money, a further artifice and cynical metaphor for cinema. This is not to say fraud as a plot device should have been forgone entirely, but it should not have been the linchpin of the story. Why even have Scottie Ferguson fall so deeply in love with this simulacrum of a deathly and possessed woman if he only needed to witness her simulated dying? That sort of malevolence is characteristic of a real puppetmaster, a regular Cartesian demon, not a man merely after money who was willing to sacrifice all of two whole lives to get it. Murderous husbands cannot stand in compellingly for God, nor can directors. Vertigo, like all Hitchcock films, falls short because the fat man never had much to do with the sublime. That he is a sacred cow of cinema is kind of a shame really.  Edit: Yet for all its flaws Vertigo could have been truly spectacular. It just needed more open ends, better development, and less meta. Indeed, the film could have been entirely saved by the removal or alteration of just a few story beats, namely the letter writing scene, the reveal of the con, and the revelations at the end. The former two are not even experienced by Scottie and are thus somewhat close to cinematic lies. So much more depth could have been added by the entire scam being ambiguously real, the possession of Madeline by Carlotta being ambiguously real, and the possession of Judy by Madeline being ambiguously real. Vertigo could have inhabited an entire world of its own without much editing, but instead it stopped spinning on a dry note. Alas, Hitchcock thought we were all cattle, and perhaps he was right, but mostly about his most ardent fans. 1.5 - 2.5
i watched this when i was in an exceptionally high feminist mood (as i always am) so yeaaa scotty what the fu
The plot twist was cool. I was very bored for the first hour though and kind of want to slap almost every character in the film. Also why are the men so old and their female counterparts so young? Wait don’t answer that.
I'm giving this 5 stars even though Hermans score ends on this weirdly abrupt major chord that makes me laugh every time I see this movie
Oh she’s a classic
I'll get so much shit for this
that little "sentimental" jab was such a slap to her face..
95% Watching this with three separate classes of teenagers, 60 yeas after its release makes for an interesting experience. Breaking it up and watching it in thirds, three times in a row makes it even stranger. And still, while the students were thoroughly engaged the entire time and MAD at the ending, it was probably the most fun I've had watching it. Three times at once, in 45 minute intervals. The faces they made as epiphanies started happening around the room were priceless. And it brought up a lot of life lessons I could impart on the girls in the class, as a parent of girls myself. So yeah, mission accomplished. Before you ask, we watched it in photography class for our color theory section.
Wow. Goes from a suspense thriller with a hint of the supernatural to a psychological survival drama to whodunit and further on to an intense love story. The woman can't help herself but go against her better sense, to be loved again. It was an accident then but she can't resist it now. She caves in to all of his what should've been eccentric requests. All this and she ends up dying at the same spot. Tragedy to top it all off. Phew! And I loved the portrayal of the relationship between Midge and Jhonny. From "don't be so motherly" to "mother's here". I don't think I have seen anything like their equation in films I've encountered so far. The only thing that annoyed me was the excessive usage of musical scores. Doesn't give you the space to immersive yourself and thereby made it seemed longer than it was.
good visuals, good score, good drama/tension, a little sexist
Not as strong on re-watch, but still slaps.
John "Scottie" Ferguson is a San Francisco cop who decides to quit the service after his acrophobia results in him being unable to save the life of a colleague. Whilst taking it easy he gets a call from an old school friend, Gavin Elster, asking him if he wouldn't mind doing a little bit of detective work for him. The job is simply to tail his wife because she's obsessed with an ancestress who committed suicide, and the wife, Madeline, is showing signs of herself being suicidal. Ferguson tails her diligently and as the tail progresses, Ferguson himself starts to become ever obsessed about the demur blonde Madeline. As the story twists and turns, Ferguson's obsession will have far reaching consequences for both parties... Vertigo is Alfred Hitchcock's most discussed, dissected and critically reappraised film, based on a novel by Pierre Boileau called D'Entre Les Morts, (also writer of Diabolique), Vertigo was not well liked on its release and unable to be viewed for some time due to copyright, the film was restored from a destroyed negative into a glorious 70mm print, and now in all its glory it can be seen as one of the greatest films to have ever been made. What is most striking about Vertigo, outside of Hitchcock baring his innermost that is, is that its plot on the surface is simplicity personified, but delving deeper, and repeat viewings are a necessity, its apparent that Vertigo is a chilling force of cinema, taking great delight in gnawing away at your perceptions, perhaps even your own capabilities as a human being. Very much a film of two great halves, Vertigo first seems intent on being an almost ghost story like mystery. Once the prologue has introduced us to Ferguson's fear of heights, we then enter an almost dream like sequence of events as Ferguson tails the troubled Madeline, the suggestion of reincarnation bleakly leading to death hangs heavy as Hitchcock pulls his atmospheric strings. Then the film shifts into dark territory as obsessions and nods to Dante's Inferno and feverish dreams take control, Hitchcock, as we have come to learn over the years, lays out his soul for us the audience to partake in, the uneasy traits sitting side by side with fascination of the story. All of which is leading us to a spine tingling finale that is as hauntingly memorable as it is shocking, the end to our own dizzying journey that Alfred and his team have taken us on. Technically the film is magnificent, the opening credits from Saul Bass brilliantly prep us for what is about to unfold, while Bernard Herrmann's score is as good as anything he ever did, unnerving one minute, swirlingly romantic the next, a truly incredible score. Hitchcock himself is firing from the top draw, introducing us to the brilliant zoom-forward-track-back camera technique to induce the feeling of Vertigo itself, with that merely a component of two hours of gorgeous texture lined with disturbing little peccadilloes. The two leads are arguably doing their respective career best work, James Stewart as Scottie Ferguson goes real deep to play it out with an edgy believability that decries his aw-shucks trademark of years since past. Kim Novak as Madeline is perhaps the quintessential Hitchcock blonde, perfect with the duality aspects of the role and playing off Stewart's ever creepy descent with seamlessly adroit skill. It however should be noted that Hitchcock and his loyal subjects had to work hard to get Novak right for the role, but the result proves that Novak had ability that sadly wasn't harnessed on too many other occasions. Vertigo is a film that I myself wasn't too taken with on my first viewing, it's only during revisits that the piece has come to grab me by the soul and refuse to let go, it not only holds up on revisits, it also gets better with each subsequent viewing, it is simply a film that demands to be seen as many times as possible. Not only one of the greatest American films ever made, one of the greatest films ever made...period, so invest your soul in it, just the way that Hitchcock himself so clearly did.
Probably one of the only people who feels this way but ehh
This might sound sacrilegious, but... Yes, it took me this long to finally see this Hitchcock classic. No, it was not exactly what it was cracked up to be. Hitchcock's expressionist use of film grammar contributes to several of the film's formal grace notes which continue to influence the art of image-making until this day. Definitely a respectable entry in the cinematic canon and the legendary auteur's ouvre, but not necessarily one I can bring myself to thoroughly enjoy.
Whoopsy I waited 22 years to watch this and still wasn’t ready!!!
there is something i must do
James Stewart feels like an amalgamation of the body of Fred Rogers and the americanized voice of Sean Connery. Bugged the shit out of me throughout the whole runtime. XD
Hitchcock generates a stunning air of mystery with 'Vertigo', coaxing brilliant performances from Stewart and Novak and using the location of San Francisco as almost a third leading "character" in his story. Stewart's obsession with Novak, and his descent into madness as he grieves over his inability to protect her, is brilliantly portrayed. As ever - in fact, more so than ever - Hitchcock keeps the audience off-balance with his disorientating camera work, ingenious plotting and atmospheric use of color. Bernard Herrmann contributes a haunting score (his fourth for Hitchcock) that heightens the passion and suspense even further. The solution when it comes is extremely clever, and proves (as if proof is needed) that Hitchcock has a masterful touch when it comes to clever plot twists. One of Hitchcock's finest.
i did enjoy this film but the romance towards the end felt wrong in many ways that made me feel a little odd
Obviously well shot and the plot was fabulous.
i put seeing this film off for so long, but i honestly don't know why. while extremely slow in the first act, hitchcock still manages to get me to this day with the goddamn twists.  and frankly, i'm impressed
Was Alfred Hitchcock just incapable of casting a brunette woman or is it just coincidence that all his leading ladies have very blonde, short hair?
A suspenseful Noir beautifully settled in San Francisco, which is boosted by that times' charming look and feeling while, underneath, covering a mysterious and thrilling search of a doubtful detective lingered in a world of superficiality, which in the end he also falls being guilty of.
Judy should have listened to Amy Dunne's advices instead of letting him turn her into a cool girl. Cool girl is hot, cool girl is game, cool girl is fun, cool girl never gets angry at her man but cool isn't supposed to die at the end.
Oh man, I was almost out of breath by the end. A true masterpiece!     p.s: Midge, sweetheart, let me give you a hug :(
Hitchcock’s best work, and it literally gets even better every time I watch it.
the perfect interwoven tale of twists, mystery, fear, and obsession; all set against the neon glow of the san francisco bay.  alfred hitchcock demonstrates complete cont mastery of his art. everything from the music to the lighting works together to create a film that grabs hold and doesn’t let go.  beginning from the opening title sequence visuals to the final minute. this story of deception and obsession is timeless hitchcockian suspense.
A perfect movie and quite possibly the greatest film of all time.
"I want to stop being haunted." Vertigo has haunted me since I first saw it a few years ago. It starts off as an excellent mystery film, then becomes one of the greatest films of all time.
'Greatest film of all time' The first half of the film consisted of uninteresting stalking where you as a viewer had a lot of questions, but never got any answers, so you just had to sit in your chair like an idiot waiting for something to happen. After that, it catches up and gets really good, but then it reaches the last act... Overall a really inconsistent film in my opinion.
A beauty from Hitchcock that is really rather twisted yet a delight to watch. The Blu Ray is gorgeous considering this movie is from 1958 and Jimmy Stewart is a delight as always.
In a nutshell: James Stewart playing a stalker for the 100th time. I think I see a pattern here.
"Mere color, unspoiled by meaning, and unallied with definite form, can speak to the soul in a thousand different ways." - Oscar Wilde
Glad to have ticked this off on the required viewing list and I see why this is considered as important and obviously recognize the aspects that are referenced over and over in many films that came after this, but the first 3/4 are drawn out and drag on as hell and the ending is stupid. Sure, the last quarter gets across the whole point this is worth watching for quite well, but is the gender commentary really meta enough to compensate for how women are depicted and treated in this film? Still seems like the only older films I can really get into are from the 60s.
First watched this at about 15 when i was just getting into film and didn't really enjoy it very much however on a re-watch it was much more enjoyable this time. Very uncomfortable watch especially towards then end with James stweart treatment of Jullie, movie needed more michelle as she did just sorta disappear towards the end but i guess she also moved on after realizing that James didn't want anything to do with her. Which was probably the best for her
james stewart talked like that cuz he had no upper lip
Alright Hitchcock, you've got my attention.
Nothing bad would have happened if Bono had been around.
What a movie! Hitchcock really is the master of suspense. It is a slow burn of a story and yet it manages to confuse you a lot in order to believe every possible outcome. The performances are yet again exceptional but the plot is so complicated. You actually come to a point where you are not sure what to make out of it, everything seems possible, until you come to the conclusion and everything is explained. And the fact is you accept the explanation, because it makes absolute sense. Hitchcock has woven this story in such a way, where you can't possibly defy it. "Vertigo" feels quite long sometimes, but it's so much rewarding by the end. I think I'm gonna love the Hitchcock filmography!
Bernard Herrmann be like: "lemme just craft the greatest Hitchcock score of all time just to flex on the haters"  Appreciated it a little more this time around but still overrated af though.
Hitchcock is simply one of those directors whose work is riddled with authorial design. It’s the opening sequences, the mirrors and the eyes, Bernard Herrmann and (most importantly) stunning blonde-leads. Seeing as this is the second time I’ve actually seen this film, admittedly the first being a long time ago now, I want to steer away from the things I like about the movie and try and work on the things I didn’t. I’m no academic on Hitchcock’s work - so I think it’s best to leave the appraisals to those who know better. TLDR; it really hasn’t aged well. The quality and aspect ratio (admittedly, it could have been down to the airplane entertainment-screen version) really bugged me seeing as the DP (Robert Burks) has created some amazing frames throughout. Perhaps the reworked criterion collection version is more visually pleasing as this is a big part of what makes Hitchcock a masterful film maker. A lot of the dialogue was so detached from empirical life, or seeping with masculinity, that it hurt to watch. This is incredibly obvious in the sequences shared in the second half of the film where Judy is a one-dimensional, subdued and bordering on idiotic version of the brooding, mysterious and sexy Kim Novak we see in the beginning. Similarly, the psyche of the characters seemed to be less clear and cohesive as people often praise them to be. The thematic ideas of this screen adaptation are so interesting and could function at a more accessible level for viewers if the character developments weren’t so erratic or their decisions seemingly unbelievable at times. Retrospectively, this may be the entire idea behind it - and Vertigo is a film worth watching over and over to find more within the subtext and subtlety. In the case of my last viewing, I wish these could have been portrayed in a stronger sense that rings true with the narratives intentions. For the simple reason of it being a Hitchcock film should not denote it as a masterpiece. Like any artist, time can ultimately damage the impact of a work - leaving behind a superlative zeitgeist to linger within the frame. That isn’t to say the Sistine Chapel isn’t as beautiful as the photograph or even that technology begets the value of a film, in the case of Vertigo and its place in the 21st century mediascape - it must be a point of both influence and reference as it should remain a historic (and now passed) moment in Hollywood cinema. PART OF THE AIRPLANE MOVIE MARATHON - NOVEMBER 26 2018
Best film of all time. Multiple viewings needed as applying critical frameworks and theory help understand the film on a psychoanalitical level.
This is a very accomplished piece of work, with a great Jimmy Stewart performance as well as one of Bernard Herrmann's best musical scores. I've always liked the dreamlike quality that the film has, particularly in how atmospheric the whole thing feels. Having said all of that, I've never quite understood the modern critical opinion of this being the greatest movie of all time. It's not even my favorite Hitchcock movie; that title would go to North by Northwest.
The colors and light are amazing. The early exchanges between Scottie and Madeleine are simply electric. Kim Novak is 🔥🔥. It went really weird in the third act, maybe one of the most disturbing romances ever (which if it were released today, would be very problematic in this #MeToo climate). But the ending was satisfying and kinda made up for the weird stuff that happened before. Kept me engaged at all times though. Confession: I thought this would be a thriller on a skyscraper like what if John McClane was scared of heights. I am dumb.
It’s still a solid film from Hitchcock but man does it drag its feet. The beauty of the rest of it makes up for it mostly but geez.
Really liked this one. Despite not particularly enjoying parts of it and questioning some of the events that transpired, I can’t deny how well made it was. How mesmerizing it was. I must say, from a first viewing, I enjoyed Rear Window a whole lot more. But this certainly evoked different emotions ranging from enjoyment, confusion, frustration, and shock. So, that sure is something.
a constant battle of me trying to view this in a historical context vs me getting sick at the thought of how women are treated on screen
60 years after the film was released, and I can only name two films that have come out since, that are better than vertigo.
Wow the score is easily the best thing about this film, it’s fantastic and dramatic and I don’t think I would have been able to sit through this without it. The cinematography is lovely and all, but all in all this film is certainly a lot to just sit through. Slow paced and suspenseful, but seeing it for the second time took away some of the surprise and excitement that made it so memorable the first time. Also forgot how much of a complete asshat John is wow he kinda sucked for a lot of it... making Judy change just for his own selfishness and she was so in love she just let him... that shit hurted
I was lucky enough to catch this in the theatre for its anniversary. I am aware of its reputation and was excited for the experience. Im slightly dissatisfied with the end result.       From the opening credits I was immediately intrigued, and my excitement only increased from this. What followed was a grest first act, an even better second, then an awful third.      I loved an immense amount of this film. James Stewart and Kim Novak are fantastic, and I especially loved Barbara Geddes. The cinematography while simple was beautiful, and the score is absolutely brilliant. The first and second act are near perfect, with only the slightly inconsistent tone and the annoying overuse of fade-outs weighing it down.      Then the film looses itself and decides to go in another direction. The third act is tedious and bafflingly disappointing. It somehow manages to make the small two hour running time feal twice its length. It’s boring, anticlimactic, and quite frankly unimpressive. The build up was so well written, but the ending chosen is a burden on the general picture that frankly ruins the otherwise great movie.       I wish the film had gone in another direction, and I am disappointed with the results of the path Hitchcock took.
I just can't believe you could go to a movie like that 60 years ago.
Everything that has been said about the sequence where Scottie follows (stalks?) Madeleine is true. One of the most beautiful sequences ever put on film.
I'm just so drawn to the tension between Scottie's obsessive love and his sense of vindication, to the point where you can't tell which is which at a certain point. Though on this subsequent rewatch I'm even more sympathetic toward Judy, who seems to be fighting toward something genuinely noble even though she knows it's probably too late for her own salvation. A love that can never be is one of the great love stories of cinema, perhaps BECAUSE it can never be.
AFI SPECIAL ENGAGEMENT: 60th Anniversary, 4K Restoration.
One of the best of all time what more and else is there to say and also do
A love story laced with mystery and melancholy; much like the spirals that permeate the film, the narrative slowly but surely pulls you down its rabbit hole accompanied by Bernie Herrmann's spidery harps, and never loosens its grip. Kim Novak's performance, specially in the later stages of the film where inner conflict ensues, goes for a knockout; her counterpart James Stewart straddles the (for the time) fine lines between manliness and a vulnerability to acrophobia - and love. Behind the camera Hitch is on one of his finest moments - the pacing is deliberate and effective, the shots are often strikingly good both on an aesthetic sense, but also from a technical point of view. Things like a dolly shot around Stewart and Novak kissing, while two different settings behind them changed seamlessly had me delighted. Some funky blends of animation and special effect shots for dream sequences were also cool way beyond 1958, the year the film was released. The spirals in Saul Bass's amazing title sequence were even computer generated! Pretty sprightly for a 60 year old movie!
What an ending! Love the symbolism behind the film and the filmmaking is wonderful, classic Hitchcock.
that was an hour and a half of "this is good but it's no rear window" then a half hour of "oh fuck it's better"
that ending was the most hitchcock thing i’ve ever seen.
bored as shite........
A twisted tale of love wrapped in conspiracy, mystery, and psychosis in a style that only Hitchcock can deliver. What else is there to say that hasn't already been said?
“Only one is a wanderer; two together are always going somewhere.” Hitchcock never disappoints. James Stewart and Kim Novak give brilliant performances. An absolute must-see.
“You either die a hero, or live long enough to see yourself become the villain.”
Not my favorite Hitchcock.
3.31/5 Ah, now this film encompasses a plot twist that was way more exciting than The Crimes of Grindelwald. It was a little slow in the beginning, but overall it was a thrill to watch. I must say, however, that the last thirty seconds of the film really had me laughing when I really shouldn't have been.
A fantastically-directed, good-looking and largely well-performed film that wraps up with a finale that feels cheaper than everything that came before it. Hitchcock asserts his filmmaking mastery to terrific effect, crafting a film that feels both tense and surprising, elevated further by James Stewart and Kim Novak's performances.
woah such an amazing film. Hitchcock is amazing this story is crazy as is the ending. Pretty much blown away as I expected to be.
Everything about this movie is fucking brilliant. Just might be Hitchcock's best
Disappointed this rating won't be going up on a second viewing. Forgot how out of nowhere the ending is. I did appreciate the film in the context of Hitchcock's whole filmography this time around.
rewatched in lecture. and i actually liked it way less this time. this movie is too long. now if a movie requires the length to effective tell it's story, that's perfectly fine. even encouraged. but that's not the case here. it's bloated, too many stupid hamfisted scene that make the complex story seem oversimplified and dull. the plot was actually really interesting all throughout. but has way too many contrivances to forgive. that being said, the framing is fantastic and the colour scheme is brilliant. hitchcock was a great director when it comes to those aspects. but aside from that he was an overrated mysoginist. and that's coming from me. classic
It was okay. Good twist, full movie, but nothing that special
Quite unlike any film I've seen before. Hitchcock's classic may be the perfect summation of his own neuroses and obsessions, it is also a near-perfect synthesis of image, sound and story. Mountains of print already written about it, to which I can't add anything of originality, but speak for how dense the film is with interpretations and analyses. It is also hugely entertaining, pulling me slowly into its spirally descending narrative. Love the way he took Stewart (the all-American Tom Hanks of his day) and made him this seriously screwed up pervert. I can imagine Hitch watching the final version of his film with a youthful grin on his face.
I've learned to love this movie, but I swear to God if I have to watch the motel scene one more time I will cut my foot off and use it to smash my computer to bits.
Enjoyed the movie ,, HATED THE ENDING,, I’m not good at writing these things so look at others if you want an intense review on this bc...whew...this was a hella movie
Didn't think this was great to be honest
Pretty unimpressed really, misogyny masquerading as psychological truth, great performances, well scored, bit boring, bit tiny.
Men truly ain’t shit
the movie was good... until the last part
I hadn't seen this before cause I'm an uncultured swine. Fun facts: - if you take away all the shots of perplexed Jimmy Stewart driving a car, Vertigo can be viewed as a Vine - Midge painting Carlotta is such a hilarious way to really fuck someone up - This movie is completely horrifying. I knew it was one of Hitchcock's most disturbing but Jesus this ruined my weekend. Perfect
“You shouldn’t have been... You shouldn’t have been that sentimental.” Only thing deadlier than heights is love. BA-DUM TSSS
probably one of my favorite Hitchcock films. you'll wanna visit Frisco after watching.
The 2018 Cult Movie Challenge Film Noir Week Vertigo is a strange noir, investigatives parts are simple and the mystery is solved in the middle of the film, then, it become more psychological, it reminds me of "Les diaboliques", that is 3 years older. From a technical aspect, Vertigo is perfect, it even gives a name to a particular camera effect. James Stewart made a great performance while i didn't like the performance of Kim Novak, i found her too much emotionless.
The Star Room Cinema Oh man, this was incredible. The first act is so slow, and meticulous but goddamn Act 2 is incredible. I've heard about the mysogynistic, and male gaze elements before hand and for 3/4 of the film I was like damn where is this stuff, Scottie seems like a nice fella, aside from sorta being obsessed with Madeleine, and then IT started to happen. Jesus, The 50's were so wild fuck lmaooo. It's incredible on a technical level, it's truly a flawed masterpiece. The dream sequences, and the neon scene are properly gorgeous. That ending is properly booty, like i've said before films used to kinda just end.
i guess i fall into the category of people not loving the ending. i would’ve rated it higher if it hadn’t been for the emotional abuse at the end that’s just not sitting well with me. the rest was SO good though
i liked it a lot to say the least,, very entertaining n funny at times I really loved the animation sequence
The fact that this pulp crime novel adaptation about history, obsession, mystery and ghosts on the streets of San Francisco can be almost universally considered one of the best movies ever made just goes to show that sometimes the world is good. My ideal noir.
Still hilarious
100/ 100 I think this may be the greatest film of all time. Vertigo is a lush beauty. It's a dark Hitchcock thriller that is filled with color and so much meticulous detail that it set a new landmark. It sees Hitchcock at his best and film at its best as it is filled with symbolism, a twisty story, and a psychoanalysis of a director who finally let's us dive deep inside his mind.
I'm going to steal so much from this film.
midge: johnny johnny john: yes papa midge: having acrophobia? john: no papa midge: telling lies? john: no papa midge: climb up the ladder john: hahaha
this film is hilarious but also im obsessed with dolly zooms so i appreciated it
Heartbreaking. Perfection exists.
Hitchcock directed a masterpiece that will prevail in film history as one of the best.
During the second half of the film my inner feminist couldn't stop screaming and that's the only reason I'm taking one star away.
You shouldn’t have been that sentimental
I'm not sure whether I liked this movie or not. Obviously, it's a legendary film, and the story held my interest, the writing had me invested in the characters. However, in 2018, Vertigo is starting to show its age in some not-so-nice ways. First of all, the treatment of mental illness in this movie is questionable. The trauma experienced by Scottie in the opening scenes and the titular vertigo that ails him as a result causes him to be characterized as a coward and a weakling, someone who wasn't able to "man up." Second, this movie has the classic Old Hollywood "teenage girl dates a skeleton" trope (ok I'm exaggerating but Madeleine is in her mid 20s and Scottie is like, 45). That alone would be more tolerable to me if some effort had been put into developing a feasible relationship between the two of them that is based on something besides just Madeleine's good looks. It wasn't all bad though, I really enjoyed the more psychedelic parts of the film, such as Scottie's fever dream sequence, as well as the mystery of Madeleine's madness. This movie is a legend for a reason, after all.
I feel after a few more viewings (even though it's over 60 years old), Vertigo will find itself in my top 5 of all time. I already felt its dizzying power from the opening credits and kept me in a state of bewilderment till the very end. Iconic camera work (the "vertigo effect"/dolly zoom anyone?), hypnotizing art direction, use of colour (green will never used quite like this again!), memorable performances and Bernard Hermann’s twisty score... it has stood the test of time. Its influence can be felt in every psychological thriller since its release. There is no denying this as essential cinema.
Gosh, I love certain things about this movie. The metaphor that vertigo/acrophobia becomes for Scottie's psyche. The use of color (so much green!). The story itself, from Scottie unfortunately being always just out of reach and unable to save those that need saving to his manipulation and being manipulated. But there are a handful of things that keep me at arms length. The movie is so deliberately paced that it feels like it lags a bit for me. While I love Jimmy Stewart in lots of movies, it feels like he's overacting here; there are some scenes where I just see Stewart doing his thing instead of Scottie. Tied to that, the melodrama at times takes me out of the movie. Often I love the music, but sometimes it is too much. I want to give this 5-stars, but I just can't. But I will keep rewatching it and showing it to my Film Studies class because there's too much going on not to.
This feels like my millionth time im seeing this (I TA first year film study and saw it three times in the past year alone) I think this sums up my latest watch best - to quote someone I respect “Hitchcock might have been an asshole but he was no idiot”
Noirvember 2018 Wow! Wow wow wow! Wow wow wow wow wow wow wow! I can’t believe I put off seeing this masterpiece for this long. What is there to say that hasn’t already been said? If you haven’t seen this film then go yourself a favor and check it out. Easily up there in the greatest of all time. Great cinematography, great directing, great writing, great acting. Superb plot twist I did not see coming. Nail biting suspense, gut churning horror, edge of your seat engagement. This film is one of those movies that utilizes everything that is possible in the medium of film to its full advantage. Every single thing in the production plays into the ideas of the film. Every possible choice on how to make scenes as creative as possible were utilized. This was truly inspiring and it was a marvel to finally watch it after so long. Anyway, don’t read my review, just watch the movie, it will be certainly more interesting than reading me blab on for two hours about things already touched upon in better criticisms of the film.
“Anyone can become obsessed with the past.” The Grand Illusion
Love Jimmy Stewart
Wild time But I loved it
all i can say is that i’m speechless. THANK YOU HITCHCOCK
A technically well made movie, Hitchcock clearly loves Technicolor. The story however, makes me wanna gouge my eyeballs out in sheer frustration.
😱😱😱😱 out of 😱😱😱😱😱 Technicolor on the 2012 BD is insane
Hitchcock proves once again that he is a master of his craft in this sublime thriller that constantly keeps you guessing while also featuring a handful of excellent performances and a hypnotic atmosphere boosted by skillful cinematography and a memorable score.
Better on the third rewatch
Finally on board, even if Vertigo remains firmly behind Psycho and Rear Window—and neck-and-neck with Strangers on a Train—on my Hitchcock master list. Hadn't seen this in over a decade, but I'd watched it about three times in a relatively short span in the mid-2000's, desperately trying to generate the same level of unabashed enthusiasm that seemingly everybody else in the film community felt; well, I'm still not quite there, but this time around, I was able to bask in the gloriously haunting compositions and mysterious psychological probing with far fewer reservations than before. Also caught some things I didn't remember at all—was pretty cool, for instance, to note that Vertigo opens in basically an identical manner to Rear Window, with a restless Stewart desperately trying to overcome a physical ailment in order to scratch a literal itch. Similarly, his complicated relationships with women of all forms—simultaneously aroused and intimidated by their strength; both Midge and Madeleine, in their own ways, blend feminine wile with an independent streak that challenges stereotype, much like Lisa in Rear Window—feels like a continuation of a trend that I didn't recall as acutely as I should have. And the way Stewart evolves from reluctant participant in the 'case' to wholly invested piece of a the puzzle...well, that goes way beyond just Hitchcock, though it's certainly most prevalent in his work. Still find the story itself to be ever-so-slightly inferior to my aforementioned favorites, especially w/r/t the switcheroo and its connotation/the conclusion, but it's still gripping as can be. Terrific performances all around, and as noted before...formally, just ravishing. Happy to have joined the fan club, and will be more than delighted to check back in over the years to continue the evolution of my personal feelings for this acclaimed behemoth, which I finally appreciate as worthy of the adoration. PRO (Also, I wish there was more Midge. She's just tremendously layered and rich, despite significantly less screen time than the other protagonists...)
Beautiful 70mm print for Hitchcocktober 2017, Sarah's first time watching
snapped!
Out of words. To quote Robert Bresson, I’d rather feel a movie than understand it. This is the epitome of that, perfectly dreamy, mysterious, cathartic. The score is one of the best ever, and this is definitely Hitchcock’s masterpiece when it comes to what film is most revolutionary in cinematic storytelling. Both Psycho and Rear window could take the top spot, but Vertigo does it for me.
I don't like going to church either
Can't decide if it is 4 or 4.5 yet. I started to lose interest after Madlen's "death", but after Scottie finds Judy it picks up and that third act is very strong.
Haha I love this film so fucking much
Missed the last 20 minutes (Film Class) but I enjoyed this throughout. Good characters and a MAGNIFICENT SCORE!
It’s been three years since I saw Vertigo so felt it was due a rewatch. It’s never been my favourite Hitchcock and this viewing didn’t change my opinion but I still like it. Thematically Vertigo is an interesting feature as screenwriters Alec Coppel and Samuel Taylor wonderfully explore the idea of possession and its impact on the characters contained within the plot. Scottie in particular becomes possessed by his past failings and his current fears and obsesses himself with the need to rid himself of them. In the second half of the film his possession of Madeleine to the point where he seeks to almost bring her back from the dead is deeply uncomfortable to watch and the writers deserve credit for managing to place such elements into a mainstream film.  However, because the writers are so interested in their main characters and the relationships between them the plot becomes almost secondary and the structure of the film is deeply repetitive to a point where it becomes a little dull in places. Scottie seems to follow Madeleine for what feels like an awfully long period of time, the deaths are all the same and Madeleine’s husband turns up at key moments to reinforce the fragile state of her mental health. So although fascinating the complex, emotional relationship between the two leads overwhelm every other aspect of the story and makes it feel a little poorly executed in terms of storytelling. From an acting stand-point Kim Novak is astonishingly good as Madeleine. Her cool acting style allows her to perfectly portray the complexity of Madeleine and right up until the end we are never entirely certain of her morality, motivations or overall intentions meaning the character remains an enigma right up until the end. However, I don’t feel that James Stewart is right for this part at all. Although undoubtedly one of the greatest screen actors of all time, here he feels out of his depth. Hitchcock apparently was concerned he was too old for the part and I think he could have been right. Him and Novak don’t have a natural chemistry in this film and Stewart doesn’t have the suaveness or darkness necessary to play such a damaged or indeed ultimately deranged character as Scottie.  Alfred Hitchcock however, ensures that Vertigo redeems itself hugely as it is an amazing directorial achievement. The use of colour in the film truly is remarkable, each set is beautifully designed with every scene featuring the recurrence of the colours Green and Red which create a beautiful visual style for the film. Some of the visual effects work such as the dream sequence is truly incredible and some of the camera technique in the film (particularly when used to visually highlight Stewart’s Vertigo) is incredibly innovative. What also is remarkable is Hitchcock’s use of the landmarks of San Francisco. Vertigo features some of the greatest location filming seen in cinema history and much of it is so good that San Francisco becomes almost a character in the film. Incredible. Special mention must also be given to Bernard Herman’s driving, brooding score which adds a great deal of suspense to proceedings. Overall Vertigo is flawed but good. The themes and ideas explored in it are bold but at times overwhelm the narrative a little and the emotionally complex nature of the main role doesn’t seem to fit with James Stewart’s acting style. However, Vertigo is saved by the excellent Kim Novak, a brilliant second half which takes the film in a startling dramatic direction and some of the best and most stylish direction seen in mainstream cinema that really is the work of a master.
My favourite film of all time. A treat to see it on the big screen again.
Catfishing for the pre-internet generation  James Stuart’s Scotty character is clearly a lame choice to keep an eye on your Mrs.  Not only is he limited to low-rise activities, before long he’s snogging her!  Not very professional. I have to confess, I struggle to see what’s so wonderful about Hitchcock’s films today. I appreciate how groundbreaking he was but this was overly long and underly clear. If Judy couldn’t see how her night was going to end the moment he pulled up at the nunnery, then she deserved to fall, screaming to her doom.
Totnes Cinema. Still my favourite film.
Beautifully shot, interesting plot, ending was clever and unexpected. First half of the film was a bit boring. Cautionary tale of the dangers of dishonesty.
First watch - what the hell! who is Madeline, or Judy, or ... who am I watching ? This plot twist has confused me and I feel like my brain twisted with it and I can’t comprehend anything. I need to watch it again.  Second watch - *distinguishes difference between Madeline and judy* ... this is beginning to make sense and the plot is fascinatingly frustrating, I need to watch it again to try and notice the clues that help unwind the plot. Third watch - Discovers the entire plot can be explained by one the earliest sequences in the entire movie (Earnie’s restaurant). I must continue watching this films as it provides so many interpretations and ideological aspects throughout the film.  Countless watches later - I love the complexity of this film, also, I should probably write a review about it on Letterboxd ... So... This movie I have now seen so many times I can no longer count it on my fingers, every time I watch it something new grasps my attention and I view it from a different perspective. Hitchcock “the master of suspense” portrays all his Fraudian influenced symbolic objects such as the ship placed in the cabinet during Ernest’s setting early on in the film, representing women and femininity. As Ernest works as a ship constructer his entire profession is symbolised for how he constructs women, foreshadowing to how he’s constructed Madeline / Judy. This is one of many symbolic objects Hitchcock uses to help unfold the thick plot.  The sequence which delivers the entire plot in the space of one minute occurs directly after the sequence previously mentioned in earnest’s space. Earnie’s restaurant is the first location where Madeline / Judy is presented, the sequence contains no dialogue just a non-diegetic score of warm string instruments playing jazz emphasising the love between the Earnest and Madeline / Judy but also the love scotty develops towards her throughout the film. When introduced she is the only character wearing colour, green, representing fertility, misfortune and envy, all of which prove true in the plot that follows. She becomes a binary contrast to the background which is red whilst she is the dominant contrast. Despite this she is very much sexualised as she has much bare skin showing and it is an indication of how she is just an object to fill the place of someone more important, but also how people see her and indirectly state how they wish to commit sexual acts with her. Later on in the sequence the spectators see the side profile close up shot of Madeline / Judy, which is half is casted in shadow through chiaroscuro and there’s a red flush of lighting covering her jawline and hairline of her versage. We only see 50% of her as she is ultimately hiding her identity, the 50% of her which is Judy. The final and most vital element to the sequence is as Madeline and earnest leave the restaurant and walk out with a mirror clearly portraying themselves this produces two exact replicas of the characters showing how they have double lives, dual personalities, dual characters, leaving scotty wonder about the actions he has seen.   Later on in the film we see Madeline / Judy’s reflection in the water, the replica of the painting and her mocking the actions indentically, alongside an endless list of symbolic actions, gestures and props which until you rewatch the film you would never notice even if you looked for it.   Hitchcock once again portrayed a physchologically confused male protagonist and extrapolates on his phobias by using his stronger feelings of love and lust. Presents a aesthetically pleasing picture of the lead female and she is 3x framed in a shot (inner doorway, doorway, and cinematic frame) thus, showing her worth alongside beauty.
it was so nice of hitchcock to pay homage to The Princess Diaries (2001) by having the setting for this film be san francisco
Pretty damn good. Personally, Golden Age Hollywood films just have a visual formula that I find really distracting, also making the pacing feel a lot slower than it really is.
tbh wig my eyes got watery while watching it, i was so speechless i keep thinking about it fuck the ending tho
I don't think Vertigo will ever be one of my favourite Hitchcocks. I don't seem to be able to get wrapped up in it, in the way I can with Psycho, Rebecca or Rear Window. But, despite that, it's still magnificent: twisted, innovative and scary.
Extremely riveting! It's weird seeing and hearing people talk about landmarks that are so close to me. The movie is beautiful, exciting, and I loved all the twists. I love Hitchcock's portrayal of obsession and love. Honestly, I didn't know anything about the story and I was genuinely surprised by how much I enjoyed it. I totally understand why this is one of his most praised films.
That storyline plot twist though ... absolutely excellent. Locals in 1958 must have been shook the absolute core watching the movie unfold. Such a graceful yet suspenseful film. The Goat. Been wanting to watch this for such a long time now and it didn’t disappoint at all. Ugh, whew.
Of course, you can't expect good old Hitch to portray women realistically, but I like how this film exposes the lethal obsession behind love of seemingly perfect men.
Me watching the wacky ass Spirograph intro: :D Me watching James Stewart driving for a really long time: >:O Me when the wacky spirals come back and James Stewart’s disembodied head comes flying out at me: :D Me realizing the rest of the film is gonna be creepy clothes-buying and stressful sorta kinda murder plots: >:O
In this hitchcock classic we follow a former police detective john ferguson who gets asked by a friend to follow his wife madeleine because she is behaving weirdly all of a sudden. John does this and during his work he starts to get interested in this woman himself. I don't really wanna say a whole lot more about the plot but it definitely manages to keep you guessing, themes include obsession, female oppression but also love and trauma. It's very well shot, with some breathtaking outdoor sceneries, the acting of our main cast is top notch (outside of the somewhat "oldschool" style ofc) and the writing is overall pretty good as well. I have some small issues with the pacing and the ending in particular, i didn't love the film but it's definitelly still a recommendation for anyone.
Here I was born, and there I died. It was only a moment for you — you took no notice. Vertigo is mostly known as Hitchcock’s masterpiece and whilst some will disagree, it still has so much to offer to the modern viewer. Brilliantly executed, it shows the director’s uncanny ability to tell both thrilling and ageless stories. The feature is original in every aspect. Novak shines as the lead woman and Stewart is a great antagonist. Everyone has different interpretations about this classic and I have to say mine changed drastically since my first viewing. Definitely a feature that asks to and needs to be revisited from time to time.
women be driving - alfred hitchcock
A fantastic escapade showcasing the origins of much of the film technique we see today. From complicated characters to flagrant use of color themes, it is a feast for the feels and the senses. Kim Novak is delicious and Jimmy Stewart brings the crazy in his way. It is also yet another example of the meticulous attention to detail that Hitchcock applies to all of his films. In every frame you can see the neurosis that makes him great. And of course, (spoiler alert) there's a murder.....
Perhaps a little more convoluted and meandering than I had hoped for, but the loose narrative is almost certainly written in intentional parallel to the "wandering" characters. Great performances by Stewart and Novak but Barbara Bel Geddes deserves special attention for her turn (and I wish Midge had gotten a bit more closure). Stylish, mysterious, and shocking. Hitchcock at his (almost) best. P.S. Hitchcock was right to want to remove the letter writing scene.
Dreamlike and vivid in it's imagery, Vertigo is a unique look into the consuming nature of obsession. The story may feel uneven and sometimes plodding, but being on the cusp of greatness is what makes the film so engaging. The story seems very personal to Hitchcock and despite it's faults, that dedication to the craft and the central ideas makes Vertigo so exceptional.
Hitchcock outdone himself with a brilliant innovation and idea for film. I love the message portrayed in this film which comments on the male and female relationship and roles. At first the ending seem kind of forced and random, but after thinking about it for a while, it ties together with the theme and I appreciate it a lot more than I originally had. Unlike films today, the acting was very overdramatic which I can understand in some scenes, for instance, when Judy is trying to play as Madeline, but in others it was just over the top for me. I feel like this is one of those films where when you watch it again you discover things you didn't notice the first time you were watching it. Adding on, I definitely have to watch this film again and appreciate Hitchcock's work even more. The soundtrack was a plus too.
i enjoyed this a lot more than i thought i would! it was energetic, engaging, and wow does that vertigo hit! i think i wanna go outside and try dolly zooming now.. brb
Hooptober 5 -- Postmortem Ashes Scattered Edition So...okay. Elephant in the room...I'm aware it's not October anymore. And look, maybe I didn't watch every single little tiny frame of film I was supposed to watch in the allotted time frame, no. But basically I made a list of films I wanted to see, and I'm gonna watch 'em by hook or by crook. Yeah. So that's this.  In Memoriam: Vertigo 1958 - 2018  Obituary: I'm the first one to admit that I'm severely lacking when it comes to "essential" films that buzzfeed lists, Roger Ebert, TCM's Saturday night lineup and countless other sources tell me that I should be watching instead of bizarre thriftstore VHS tapes or 2002's Rollerball for the 50th time.  It's true. You can pretty much name any certified classic film that comes to mind and the fact is that I haven't have seen it. That's not truly intentional on my part. I have nothing inherently against films with a pedigree or a great reputation. I just seem to de-prioritize them entirely too often in lieu of picking up things that are more extremely polarizing.  Or that I have absolutely no knowledge of at all. Because I definitely do get a giddy little thrill discovering a hidden gem like that on my own instead of picking up a film that I think will be good and then just....enjoying it the exact same amount I assumed I would. Part of me also kind of enjoys not being inspired by great things as well. So that if and when I ever do come up with a joke, a story, a thought, or an idea that other people think is especially clever and it happens to resemble something that was already minted and coined as "great" decades ago by a talented auteur that I was unaware of, it reminds me that I inadvertently shared some inspiration when a truly great mind all on my own.  Don't laugh! It could still happen one day! I got a good, original knock knock joke in me yet before I'm gone! So more often than not, while I roll the dice on inauspicious fluff like Russell Madness, Josh and S.a.m. or 3 Ninjas High Noon at Mega Mountain, certified wolves in wolves clothing elites like Citizen Kane, Modern Times, Grand Illusion, The Godfather, Schindler's List and Sunset Boulevard collect more dust on my shelf. But not today!  Today I indulged in a film that more than elventy billion finely educated folks with delicately, well kempt and manicured fingernails agree is stunning, thought provoking, mind-bending, clever, exceptionally well made, and also good. It's Alfred Hitchcock's Vertigo. And yeah.  To paraphrase Joel Siegel: It's dope dawg.  Moderately dope AF. It's a beautifully crafted and noticeably meticulously made piece of work that is able to flesh out a two sentence pitch into a legitimately surprisingly and tense affair.  It's visuals and dream sequences are jarring and animated exceptionally well. And the color that pops off of this thing I think has only been rivaled by fellow neon nightmare Suspira in my eyes. I do have to rip on its presentation however.  For having successfully(?) avoided all things Vertigo for 34 years, putting in the VHS restoration version leads immediately to a PREVIEW FOR THE VERTIGO RESTORATION VERSION!  WHAT? WHY?! And then! Not only do I get to watch a solid 2 minutes of Vertigo sizzle reel. It's followed by THE ORIGINAL THEATRICAL TRAILER FOR VERTIGO AS WELL! GREAT! Now I get to see all the beats driven into my head TWICE in a row!  Thanks for shilling me a version of film THAT I'M LITERALLY ALREADY PLAYING Universal! You're the real monsters here. As for the rest of it...the cinematography.  The acting prowess. The blocking. The pitch shifting.  Yeah...I'm woefully unqualified to weigh in on any of those fronts.  Because I'm going to compare them to Rollerball's or a selection of Muppet Baby cartoons.  And that's going to definitely illicit all kinds of scoffing at and chortling and and throat phlegm rearrangement noises from upper crust cinematic hierarchy wearing monocles and looking through opera glasses on sticks.  It's not fair for me to knock a film down pegs for being intimidating or having a particular fanbase, but juggernauts like this whose fans know it backwards and forwards are in a word: intimidating. The thing I will tell you though is that this is very much a better directed movie than it is a story being told.  Hitchcock's eye is the star of the show here. Creating a dreamlike vibe and smokey ambiance throughout the proceedings while purposely meandering through the first hour or so of the picture are its strengths.  While it's weaknesses lie in character depth, backstory and motivation. Want proof? Explain the plot to a middle school kid who's never heard of it TOMORROW and watch them make that ugly, disgusted scrunchface that only shitbird kids that age can make.  Then swat the books out of their hands and call 'em a FUCKIN NERD and RUN! Overall, am I sorry I watched this?  Of course not. It was and remains an example of an extremely skilled person doing what they do best.  But it also kind of validates my earlier point. I enjoyed this about exactly as much as I assumed i would.  No seismic blips on the radar scale pro or con. So does that make watching it irrelevant? Should I have been more aggressive by stepping up and taking a gorilla hack at something like Chopper Chicks in Zombietown and hoping for the best?  At first thought maybe. But marinating on it, not always. Because these days I'm watching films made by people who have already all grown up inspired by the greats already. So I've unknowingly leeched off of selected greatness here and there just by proxy and through osmosis.  And even if something has a storied reputation, I'm comfortable enough in the taste palette I've carved out for myself to be able to recognize what I'd consider good, bad or ugly. And confident enough to not be swayed just because "SHAUN EDWARDS OF FOX TV SAYS THIS IS THE COOOOLEST MOVIE OF THE SUMMER!"  To me, the only thing reputation does to a film is increase its longevity. And Vertigo's lineage managed to get it preserved by greater minds than mine and give me the chance to view it for myself. Glad I had the chance. Okay. Back to Rollerball. RIP (Phantom) Plot #25. Screened out of competition. In lieu of flowers, please pay your respects here. Complaints and grievances about the care/smell of your loved ones may be directed to your caretaker.
Not his worst movie, but probably his worst treatment of women.   It’s a product of the time, I get it, but even with that in mind this is still pretty hard to swallow. The first half is great, a private eye on a paranormal hunt for the truth trying to overcome the psychological scarring of a horrible event? Fuck yeah! The last half, a woman being forced to change herself entirely for a man who has become crazed and controlling, I can give that a pass.  On a technical level Hitchcock knocks it out the park. His long slow shots, dynamic use of lighting, everything that makes him the master of suspense is here in force. James Stewart lends himself to another great performance, as does Kim Novak. The story is well structured and intriguing. But that last act.
No matter how simple this plot is, it keeps you stucked on the entire story. "Vertigo" is about traumas and how day life is influenced by what frighten us. When our fears take power even other people could be involved. They suffer and find themselves in bad situations. Events are matched by a variety of colors to convey different emotions. Hitchcock had a lot of fun using them. This is a must-see movie.
The pacing and cinematography are great and the story is even better. Just edged out North by Northwest for my favorite Hitchcock film.
this is about as good as the rocky horror picture show, according to my recent letterboxd activity. you’re welcome, everyone!
Uhm.. what? Why do people love this movie so much? Is it the story that's completely laid out in front of the viewer halfway through the film? The main character that starts out unstable and obsessive and ends up unstable and obsessive? The romance blooming between two characters who share five minutes of screentime and whose interactions turn out to be largely dishonest? The ridiculous ending that renders the entire movie pointless? Sure, it's well-shot, but so it Notorious. Watch Notorious instead.
James Stewart and Kim Novak star in Alfred Hitchcock’s psychological thriller about attraction, duplicity, domination and desperation. Also starring Tom Helmore and Barbara Bel Geddes. When Vertigo was released, it received a mixed critical reception, but is now regarded as a classic of Alfred Hitchcock’s filmography. However, I disagree with the latter part of this, because this is not a perfect film from the Master of Suspense. The story concerns an ex-police officer who, suffering from an intense fear of heights, is employed to stop an old pal’s wife from killing herself, but all isn’t what it appears to be. James Stewart gives a very good performance in his role as John ‘Scottie’ Ferguson, the former cop who has to try and stop a woman from committing suicide, but he finds it harder than what he thought it was going to be like. He suits his role well. Kim Novak is decent in her double role as Madeleine Elster and Judy Barton. Madeleine is the woman who is behaving in a very strange way, while Judy is the woman who Madeleine reveals herself to be. This is perhaps the most memorable role of her career. Elsewhere, there are respectable supporting performances to be had from Tom Helmore and Barbara Del Geddes in their respective roles as Gavin Elster and Midge Wood. Gavin is Madeleine’s husband who is concerned by his wife’s conduct, while Midge is the woman who used to be engaged to Scottie. The direction from Hitchcock is very good because he allows the facial expressions to be seen to a strong effect throughout, while also keeping a tense atmosphere happening as well and the script is written to a decent standard by Alec Coppel, Samuel A. Taylor and Maxwell Anderson as they make the movie good to follow. The technical aspects that stand out best are the set, camera and music, because the set is terrific to view throughout; the camera makes very good use of the locations and also captures the tense moments well, which get the edge-of-the-seat status; the music is very enjoyable to listen to. The movie managed to win 2 Academy Award nominations: Best Production Design (Black-and-White or Colour) and Best Sound. However, this isn’t perfect, because the pace of the film can be very slow at times and a result, the movie didn’t need to run for 129 minutes. Also, although there is a tense atmosphere happening, there isn’t as much occurring as there is compared to other Hitchcock films. This is a real shame. Overall, the performances from James Stewart and Kim Novak, direction, script and technical aspects are very good, but Vertigo is not a masterpiece, due to the sometimes-very slow pace and lack of tension on occasions.
the male gaze is a hell of a drug
This was a really nice film but I have to admit I found it very confusing and really very hard to follow. In the end I understood vaguely what was going on but the final scene felt so rushed still and it left me very un-at peace. On top of this, it was way too long and I found myself severely bored several times. I'm a sucker for old films though I can't lie.
been doin a lot of 5-stars lately, not sure if it’s because my standards are changing or i’m just watching good movies 🤔
Ya know what, no one’s really gonna read this bc of the length so I’m gonna say everything that’s on my mind, let’s just jump into it. Vertigo is utterly amazing. The cinematography is top notch (and man oh man does it look great on blu ray), the leads are strong, and it manages to balance its plot to turn what could’ve been a convoluted mess into a heart pounding and emotional thriller. Hitchcock is (obviously) a genius in his craft, and his direction especially shines here. Stewart and Novak turn out wonderfully complex performances that really pay off in the final act. Speaking of that third act, a lot of people on here aren’t a fan. Personally? Loved it. It did have a multiple ending problem, but the final one really sticks the landing. I probably teared up while watching it (really don’t remember) but I did feel really confused and just out of it afterwards (thanks Alfred?). This is probably one of the longest things I’ve written on here and I’m running out of things to say and I honestly pulled like half of this out of my ass to sound smart and my thumbs are starting to hurt so I’m gonna leave it at that, BUT I just wanted you to know that this is one of those movies I could ramble on for a while about.  Also this is some good shit right here, I’d recommend if you liked this movie (or you didn’t and you’re just a film nerd)
I have been watching Hitchcock films lately and this is my favorite so far. The plot is great and it is handled masterfully. I loved the range of tones in the film -- from eerie haunted house to thriller. The visuals were beautiful. Kim Novak was an extremely talented actress. Great film! My only complaint is that the pacing was slow at times.
Arguably Hitchcock’s best and one of Stewart’s best performances. He really is quite disturbingly crazed and is both manipulated and manipulative as he discovers the truth. The visuals and colour palette are gorgeous and that score by Herrmann is nothing short of astonishing.
A classic Hitckock, not that boring actually, and impressive. I have found it a bit too long to be truthful, but also entertaining. Of course I have loved to pieces the green curtains scene.
I genuinely find I like this film less each time I watch it. The first act is really clunky, the editing is all over the place (for me), and that ending is just so...underwhelming. It's deliberately paced and plotted, but that deliberation just isn't my cup of tea. Highlight of this watch: My GF, seeing it for the first time, saying "If this doesn't end with a confrontation on the Golden Gate bridge, I'll be bummed.
