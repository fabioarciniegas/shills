This was Marty Scorsese’s arrival into mainstream cinema in America, and also the career launchpad for Robert De Niro and Harvey Keitel. The film was hailed as one of the most original films in years, and even American history, and that thought still holds up well today. Passionate and energetic, it is one of the most groundbreaking films of the 1970’s.
Johnny Boy: what color is the pink panther? Charlie, taking his clothes off: Johnny Boy you're so fucking stupid
Will soon be buying a blu ray of this film since my fucking dvd copy keeps dying halfway through. Great film overall though, especially considering how early of a film this was for good old Marty.
William Blake shout-out. I guess that one guy was a British lit major.
scorsese’s the searchers, showing despicable characters and how the environment they live in makes them into maniacs. throughout charlie touches fire, signaling how close to danger he is and how attracted he is to it. the film has so much energy to it, one of those films that inspires you to make films of your own.
What’s a mook?”
STREET LEVEL. Loose plot, hungry actors. True grit.
“Mean Streets” showcases two great, star-making performances from Robert De Niro and Harvey Keitel, and plenty of the Scorsese brilliance that would soon come into true fruition in the future, but is overall just forgettable, mostly due to a narrative of events that feel too loose, unfocused, or scattered to feel like one complete piece. But all in all, it’s still a pretty decent effort, especially for something that was clearly very personal to Scorsese himself, just nothing really special either.
Meanders a bit, but finishes extremely strong. Charlie says he finds salvation on the streets, and he's one of Scorsese's more interesting and complex characters, hitching his wagon to such an unbridled force of chaos as Johnny Boy. The performances and soundtrack are top-notch.
Martin Scorsese: You don't make up for your sins in church. You do it in the streets. You do it at home. The rest is bullshit and you know it.
82 Not as good as most other Scorsese movies but still really great.
A great  film with amazing quotes and fantastic actors !
Of course Deniro’s character is named Jonny Boy, all that means is trouble  Pre-1980s Movie Marathon #21
A movie about a man in New York named Charlie who is being suffocated by Catholic guilt. Every night, he enters the seedy bar owned by his friend Tony and he is submerged into red lights. Sin consumes Charlie and his guilt causes him to suffer. Throughout the movie, he desperately tries to do good deeds in order to regain some sort of spiritual homeostasis. The movie contains brilliant scenes displaying the racism, machismo, greed, and mental illness within the Italian-American community. It is a MUST WATCH!
THE FIRST MARTIN SCORSESE STEP- 10/10
One of my all times favorite, Mean Streets is the exemple for the perfect sound track and how it goes along perfectly with the history. If you are a fan of Scorsese’s movies or want to see a good movie, a strongly recommend you to watch it!
This is Scorsese at his most bare. It feels like an incomplete film to a 21st century viewer, but the experience of witnessing a master try out his craft is worth the price of admission. So much of what is in this film has become "normal" in the modern world of cinema, and it speaks to the influence of Scorsese as an artist.
Like the beginning of 'Mean Streets', You could be my baby
You don't make up for your sins in church, you do it in the streets. The rest is bullshit and you know it.
Some films really benefit from a rewatch. This is not one of those films at all. The mesmerising effect of the visuals really didn't knock me out on this second viewing - brought on by seeing Taxi Driver for this first time the over night. The pacing is meanderingly slow. The dialogue that on first approach several years ago had a sense of joy now just feels stilted in parts and drives me up the wall at overs. The biggest issue with rewatching Mean Streets is that it gives room for the obvious weaknesses of the plot to shine through. I get this was made years ago and set the scene for many gangster movies, hence the 4.5 star rating for a film I struggled to watch this time round. I remember the effect it had on me the first time I watched it' the captivating nature of it; of the way each scene was shot. Of the characters and there glamorous delinquency, the juxtaposition between shooting for Hollywood but shooting New York - 70s New York - the rougher times of the city. Taxi Driver may have been Paul Scholes love letter to New York but this is Scorseces, the mob and the Italians realised on this screen. Despite my struggling to rewatch it would be unfair not to recognise how original the film was when it came out and would certainly be unfair to dull the mesmerising effect of the film because it is slow upon rewatching. The fact I didn't notice any of that on first watch says enough about the direction and the film's status. In comparison to Taxi Driver the main thing of note in Mean Streets is that there's many scenes in Mean Streets that serve little to no plot purpose, by the time of Taxi Driver that's completely removed from the equation; a remarkable improvement in a short space of time.
One of the best Jean Luc Godard's movies. Jokes aside, this movie really is 200% nouvelle vague and expecially Godardian. Mostly in its characters. Scorsese approaches his first movies in an anarchic way already known to french filmmakers of the seventies, not just conceptually, but also on the field with all the long shots, the hand-held cameras and the way of cutting. This movie screams.
These streets are mean, bruh.
bitch scorsese invented the color red OKAY
Beautifully shot, experimental moments, a pleasure to watch. I watched over three days, continuity of plot line suffered some, but the vision was intact.
an aimless, self-indulgent ode to violent hypermasculinity that perfectly captures the insouciant arrogance of wanna-be gangsters and middle-aged delinquents who somehow still think that ripping off kids and picking up girls and getting into pointless fights are "the cool things to do". the movie meanders through overly shadowed sets and street corners, never really doing or saying anything and just relying on the sheer audacity and uncouth verbosity of its central characters to carry it along at a limping pace. credit where credit is due though: stellar acting performances by robert de niro and harvey keitel - i did hate robert de niro's smarmy johnny boy and his headstrong arrogance but i concede that my blinding rage was only possible because de niro committed so fully to his character. i'd be the first to say that misogyny and racism shouldn't automatically disqualify a film from being good or having other artistic merits but all of the macho self-entitled greasy violent aggression was aggravating and the way they treat and portray women as objects and plot points and things to be had and touched and possessed holy crap i just wanted to scream; its a celebration of sin if i ever saw one, even if the film pays lip service to other interpretations
Godard mon amour - Scorsese
Acting, cast - awesome! Story line, plot, etc. - weak.
Like listening to your favorite band's debut, self-released EP. A little raw, and perhaps not quite as coherent as their later work, but still, all of the ingredients are there. All of Martin Scorsese's ticks, like his fetish for steady cam, affinity for pop music, and tendency towards themes of masculinity, violence, and faith are on display, just in a cruder package. Harvey Keitel can be a little wooden, and the script can kind of fall into becoming "Eh! Oh!: The Movie," but Robert DeNiro (who, even at 30, looks 55) is great as a loony neighborhood kid, and there are plenty of brilliant scenes. The "private party" for Jerry that slowly descends into a drunken melee and the harrowing closing scenes are representative of a more visceral style the Scorsese moved away from when he started working on prestigier and more period focused work in the 2000s and 2010s. I'd lament his departure from this grittier approach, but the truth is that I don't know that the best moments from this film could be re-created by a seventy year old established director. Mean Streets is a story about angry and confused young men of a particular time and place, and it took an angry and confused young man from that time and place to tell it.
There should be more poolroom brawls set to Please Mr. Postman. I had only seen this once, before I started reviewing movies online... it had to be at least a decade ago. Thus, I figured I need to talk about more Scorsese here anyhow and it playing on TCM last night meant that this was the right time, right place for me. That initial movie I more liked the movie than loved it and alas, this opinion has not changed the second go-around. The general idea is fine of following around a young man (Keitel) who has a loan shark uncle yet due to Catholic guilt-this already became a Scorsese trademark-is unsure if he wants to follow in his family footsteps. Meanwhile, he has a loose cannon friend (DeNiro) who causes problems and he has a girlfriend who is ostracized because she has epilepsy. If only I could have cared more about the story or the characters... I can still say that this is good and that is nothing to sneeze at. This is clearly a low-budget effort, pretty gritty with naturalistic lighting (some scenes are bathed in red and it makes for a great image) and intimate camerawork. Even back then Scorsese knew how to create a quality soundtrack-there are some old Italian songs and-shock of shocks-The Rolling Stones but otherwise it's old R&B, including the original version of Please Mr. Postman by The Marvelettes that is heard during a rough and tumble donnybrook in a pool hall; what a juxtaposition that was. Of course its biggest asset aside from having a director that would later become a legend is the two leads who are great actors and one became a legend himself. That for certain helped me watch this even if I don't love Mean Streets like many do.
Falls in line with the other great Scorsese/De Niro mob movies: Goodfellas, Casino, Shark Tale, And, hopefully, The Irishman.
mean streets, taxi driver, and raging bull are the Scorseses to swear by! even though he's always made great movies and is still a great soul, there's something about early Scorsese that I really love more than any of his other stuff; it's the grit, the fly-on-the-wall Cassavetes-inflicted camerawork (Cassavetes actually advised Marty to make mean streets after he said that he thought boxcar bertha was "a piece of shit". can you blame him?) the feeling of genuine love of cinema that mean streets (Marty) has. there's a total fuck-you attitude, not just from the subject matter, but from the total creative freedom of it all. it's just a bunch of uber-talented art school students (Marty, Harvey, De Niro) making the movie that they wanted to make, not referencing anything from the past but rather inventing its own grammar. after rewatching it I really want to make something, write something, film something. it makes me feel the youthful energy right off of the screen, the raw talent and love of art. the two most important gangster movies of all time are the godfather and mean streets. the godfather is the elder statesman of crime, a world where family and moral codes matter at least a little bit, and everything is (wonderfully, intricately, and perfectly) planned out and executed with intention like the sistine chapel. mean streets captures the sweat dripping from people's necks, shows the seedy strip clubs and bars where desparate wannabe criminals steal money and blow up mailboxes for kicks; it's created with spontaneity and throwing caution to the wind. criminally (no pun intended) underappreciated for sure, up there with taxi driver, with my fave Scorseses. I would not change a single thing about mean streets. why would you? :))
Scorsese with a twist
what the actually fuck?!?
an italian love letter to film that climaxes like an opera, what a movie!
A little rough around the edges, but obviously hugely influential.
(Typed Review In Progress)
This I wish I had seen so much earlier—around the time it came out, and to have been wiser then than the 10-year-old I was—as the reviews from the time credit Mean Streets with essentially having revolutionized filmmaking. Not that I cannot fathom that academically now, but having lived cinematically pretty much entirely in Mean Streets' wake, seeing it for the first time now is more an exercise than the impactful experience it would have been at its release. Scorsese's seemingly loose narrative, the pick-up-and-go feeling of the camerawork, the grittiness of the setting, characters, and language would undoubtedly have been a bit of a shock to audiences more used to highly polished Hollywood fare at the time, but the style, continually practiced by Scorsese since along with countless other directors he influenced, is not a shock now. The film remains worthwhile viewing on its own, and that's what my star rating reflects, but add another one if viewing the film as a cinema history exercise.
me, running up to martin scorsese: for $1, name a woman
I need someone to love me as much as Martin Scorsese loves using Rolling Stones songs in his movies
“You don't make up for your sins in church. You do it in the streets. You do it at home. The rest is bullshit and you know it.”
The atmosphere is what it needs to be. The entirety of the film feels sleazy, Italian and most importantly mean. For the first 30 minutes, all we get is the atmosphere. The characters live out their everyday life, and this happens so that the audience can get a feel for what it's like to be in the mean streets. These aren't characters that your average joe hangs out with. They're thought of as criminals who want nothing to do with you but to put a bullet in the middle of your eyes. Martin Scorsese wants to put this pre conceived notion to rest, so he opens on a polaroid with home video style text. The inciting incident is introduced early on in the movie, but it's unclear that this will lead anywhere. It feels like everyday speech that the characters say to each-other, it's the equivalent of saying hello and goodbye. The audience feels the atmosphere, and just accepts that what is being said is said all the time. This is the films biggest fault. When we are presented with an inciting incident it doesn't need to be life changing, but it should present a change. It's all breezed over until it needs to come back, and for this it doesn't really feel like you're watching a story unfold. It feels like you're watching a guys mildly entertaining life. Mean Streets has its moments, but in total falls short of being what other Scorsese masterpieces are. A story told in a brilliant fashion, in which the audience gets to feel like they know every character. Mean Streets has the characters, but the story itself needs a little work.
Maybe I made a mistake in watching this so soon after having seen Taxi Driver, or perhaps this movie's reputation set my expectations a bit too high, but I just didn't click with this as much as I'd hoped. It's got strong performances, gorgeous cinematography, and Scorsese's gritty, realistic depiction of life in 1970s New York never ceases to captivate me, but the narrative that fills this grimy setting felt a little flat in my eyes. It moves very glacially, and it doesn't really feel like much of interest is really taking place throughout most of the movie. It could just be those "first viewing blues" setting in, but I don't know. I'll definitely revisit this at some point, as there's still a lot of elements about it that I do like and it's not as though the story is bad, it just didn't draw me in as much as I'd hoped it would the first time around. We'll see if that opinion changes.
Proper title, this. Those streets were very mean!
Dull and difficult to get invested in, this film feels like a *rough* draft of Goodfellas and Casino. Scorsese’s signature direction is there which is nice as always but there’s really nothing crazy here.
Beautiful editing but not the best storyline. Saw this for my film class.
"What's the matter with you? Geet outtaa heeeree"
This film is an important part of who I am, I don’t know what else I can say.
I can't stop swooning over young Harvey Keitel.
Can you imagine seeing this 45 years ago and wondering what everyone involved would do next?
This was a weird one - wacko scene to scene structure (even if I could get my head around the narrative structure overall), sound mix was so shit like people would go from speaking in a studio to speaking on set in one word. Saw Harvey Keitel in Youth like the day before and was interesting to see him be a completely different character, and will probably watch Taxi Driver next to see where De Niro goes to. Soundtrack was really good
Definitely one of the best rewatches of all time for me. I don't even feel like this was the same movie I watched. My eyes have been deceived. This is one of my favorite films of all time. I love literally every single shot of this film so much.
Back when Scorsese had an indie vibe to his work, like a hot-shot new director with potential to be great - but not yet the funding. It's nice to see how resourceful he already was, though. Baby De Niro and Baby Keitel were already great actors. Funny to see how young they were (I'm a millennial, don't judge me) and how much potential they already showed. Mean Streets seems to be the one from which Guy Ritchie draws his inspiration for, like, all of his movies?
Pretty good, I love Scorsese, and while his old films tend to be kind of rough, they have an unique charm to them. One can clearly see the correlation between this and his newer gangster movies (it is fun to see the progress). Robert De Niro is fantastic here. Great soundtrack. Worth a watch.
Holy mother of mercy that was intense
God-tier use of "Rubber Biscuit," "Be My Baby," and "Please Mr. Postman."
Disappointing first half, second half was actually pretty good
Marty Scorsese’s killer music cues, Kent Wakeford’s dreamlike slow-mo and Sidney Levin’s kinetic editing feel like the birth of modern American cinema — but I’m not sure “Mean Streets” is greater than the sum of its innovative parts. 35mm. Museum of Modern Art.
Possibly my favorite Scorsese film. Thoroughly enjoyed it. Surprisingly romantic
Huh so it turns out the meanest streets were the friends we made along the way
Scorsese at his absolute best.
Just as crazy as fuck Love it
Finally saw this one. Fit very well with the Pusher family. Scorcese shows incredible potential, but hasn´t achieved mastery yet.
The groundwork of every Scorsese’s gangster movies to follow. Mean Streets introduced us to the constantly moving and ever chaotic world of street crime and the organized mob as he envisioned. Yet unlike his later, more polished work in the likes of The Goodfellas or Casino, this first entry is raw in every sense of the word. And that sense of rawness is what gave the film it’s genuine quality that Scorsese’s later work may have just missed. The suit and tie smooth talking mafia is sure fun to watch, but the story of two young boys trying to survive in the mean streets of mobster New York - that has it’s own captivating quality.
oh, johnny boy, baby... i still dream of you and that dorky smile of yours
A bit unfocused and roughly cut/edited. Nice to see more of a 'lower' viewpoint and not always the big gangsters though
« What’s the matter with you ?! »   Old New York, De Niro weirdo/gangster. Yeap. ❤️
A classic that teach how to tell a story about the mafia, the old and real mafia, a unique vision of the real gangs of business in Little Italy, accompanied by a wonderful soundtrack all the time.
maybe if the streets were NICE!
85/100 Few filmmakers can boast of a classic like this one being only their third film.
Maybe I would‘ve know what the fuck was going on if I wasn‘t so drunk and in love with De Niro.
punch me for not focusing on the plot 76% of the time.... but I still love you Robert
Every time I get out they PULL ME BACK IN*  *me on movies
Did I even like this ? I don’t know but I loved de Niros mod getup
͞You don't make up for your sins in church. You do it in the streets. You do it at home. The rest is bullshit and you know it.͟ The intro quote of the first truly Martin Scorsese movie. In this movie are all the themes, ambitions, characteristics, sins and obsessions of this master. I see the seed of Casino in the way the chain of power works in the back of the bar. The way Charlie want to become more getting the restaurant is the motivation of Goodfellas. The streets are equally dirt like the New York of Travis Bickle. Even the way of paid penance remained me Silence, a movie of 2017, this movie was premiered in 1973, 44 years between each. In this movie, we see a cinephile mind who has seen everything. The old German directors, all John Ford movies, he watched Red Shoes and Citizen Kane. The French nouvelle vague captivates him. His fellow friend Francis just change everting one year ago with The Godfather and he don’t want to become an exploitation filmmaker. He hit the audience with this powerful imperfect movie. In this very movie he accomplishes two things I consider crucial to understand his career. His master mind of montage and released a force of nature called Robert De Niro. This movie isn´t his finest work. But is the first door to understand this master.
Seemed pretty rough for a Scorcese, a little unfinished. Enjoyed the characters and their interactions.
This isn’t so much a “gangster movie” as it is a film about what it is like to grow up in a gangster environment. Scrocese has always had this ability to make you feel as if you are inside the world his presenting to you, and this is certainly one of those films.  In a strange way, you’re sympathetic to both Charlie and Johnny Boy despite their blatant differences. Charlie is a pragmatist who struggles with the gangster life and his devout Catholicism, whereas Johnny Boy is simply swept up in the life and seems to enjoy it so much that he likes to stir shit up when things get boring. But you understand both the practicality and the boredom, because you get the sense that both men are simply going along with the motions in the only way they know how to.  I would love to see this on the big screen, because the cinematography and the use of the color red are both gorgeous.
De Niro as a livewire maniac saves this for me. Keital is a totally ineffective lead, boring and tonally inconsistent. Found the plotlessness frustrating, it felt like two guys having one argument over and over for two hours.
The beginning dragged out and could have been executed more efficiently. For me at least, the beginning had already set up the characters, the tone, whatever we need to know in terms of story, some artistic moments, and then a whole extra more time that wasn't necessary. The real meat of the film started halfway and got me excited and interested from then on. I wish that the whole hand over fire and religion concept was consistent throughout not only at the beginning and a bit at the end.
The music Elevated the movie even higher for me
I remember the pub I went to the day I first saw this. Well I went there again today and just felt the desire to rewatch my favourite Scorsese. It's flipping been a while, it's insane! Such a masterpiece. The day they release a definitive blu ray/4K is the day I rest easy at night.
This is my 4th or 5th time watching this film and damn, it still holds up very well.
I love how Scorsese uses music, even this early on, and it’s great seeing De Niro and Keitel so young, but I just can’t get into this one.
Ambling and unfocused in that 70's way that sometimes works for me and sometimes really doesn't. Great soundtrack, strong scenes, but it just goes absolutely nowhere, and then it ends and you're like, that's it? You're not going to resolve anything? Every single female character in this movie deserves better.
Getting in a knock-down drag-out pool hall brawl after seeing THE SEARCHERS is *chef’s kiss*
Gritty character study is one of Martin Scorsese's finest achievements. 9.5/10
A pretty solid film with great acting and an explosive ending
What, you call that an ending? You’re just gonna leave me hanging, like I’m some kinda mook? Look, I got outta bed, I put in my two hours just like everybody else. A movie’s gotta have three things, all right? You got the beginning. Then you got the middle. Then you gotta gimme an ending. No ending, no movie, you got me? A real movie, it’s gotta give you some closure. Like you have a big wedding, or you win the big game, or you kill the, whaddaya call it, you kill the Predator. It’s like my Uncle Jerry, you know him, he got hammered at his daughter’s wedding, but he insisted on giving the toast. He told this joke; it had a rabbi, it had a priest, it had a shoe salesman, it had everybody, it went on for forty-five minutes, swear to God. Right before the punchline, he sits down. Can you believe that? He just sits down, falls asleep. I tell him later, Uncle Jerry, you got to tell me the rest of the joke. What happened to the rabbi, the priest, the shoe salesman, you got to tell me the punchline. You know what he says? He says, What joke? He swears he don’t know no jokes about no shoe salesman, can’t even remember giving his daughter away. You got any idea how frustrating that is, thinking about that joke? My cousin, she just celebrated her tenth wedding anniversary, but me, I’m still wondering what happened to the rabbi. I’m gonna forgive ya this time, Marty, on account you got good pathos. But when you make Mean Streets 2, and I’m talking yesterday, it better pick right up where this left off, all right?
atmosphere
It's not very common that I get really excited about something I see as pioneering or before its time, especially when I think I've seen the techniques used more effectively by something more modern, but I found myself pretty much in awe of some of Scorsese's camera work here. Particularly the way the camera movement was syncing up with the actors and how kinetically the camera moved when showing Keitel's drunkenness. The story is a pretty interesting and grounded take on gangster-ism. It's place in the genre is pretty interesting to me, both as an early predecessor to Goodfellas and as a film coming a year after the Godfather. As a direct response to the later this more grounded and much grittier take on the life of the gangster is an interesting contrast to the cleaner and more operatic tone of Coppola's classic.
i love the setting, the acting. the story is kind of a mess though. really interesting watch. the shots mixed with awesome music. the hints of something special to come.
Though messy, this is an early success for Scorsese, who begins laying the groundwork for his greatest hits and establishes himself as a unique and wildly fresh new voice. Here, Scorsese is transitioning out of his Who's That Knocking At My Door nouvelle vague worship into his more trademark crime stories about toxic masculinity and American mythology. A very young Robert De Niro gives a fantastic performance only matched by the camera itself, which has all the freedom in the world, moving deftly through fight scenes and shouting matches between tough guys. Paired with doo wop and Rock'n'Roll tunes, it makes for a stylistically invigorated film much ahead of its time.
nice hester street great pulls
Not what i expected for sure. A treat to watch though. Italian American shit, Madonne.
tfw you make a film about mobsters titled “Mean Streets” that's mostly people hanging out and shit. but actually, this streets ARE kinda mean: it's easier to fuck people over than to take care of them, even when you got a little bit of power (and maybe specially so, because of just how big of a deal appearences are!) sometimes his (excellent) use of music feels like he's overcompensating tho
Mean Streets is often overlooked in Scorsese's filmography. It doesn't have the legions of fans behind Taxi Driver and Raging Bull or even the cult success of (the massively underrated) The King of Comedy. I love these films (especially The King of Comedy) but it was Mean Streets that kick started my love for Scorsese. This picture has a looser narrative than Scorsese's other work, incorporating an ensemble cast of characters dealing with their trials on the streets. Our main man Charlie (a young hood played by Harvey Keitel), tries to balance his friendships, romance and mafia life while also dealing with issues of faith and lust. This broad spectrum of ideas and characters may turn some people off, but the freedom Scorsese has within this narrative leads to scenes of unbounded energy and creativity: look at the now infamous red lighting used in the bar to exude an alluring sense of looming danger; notice the use of jump-cuts and romanticised close-ups in the introduction of Teresa (this scene paying a heavy tribute to Breathless); awe at the permeating fun of the "mook" brawl where handheld action is actually done properly. No other Scorsese movie has this level of experimentation. The freeform shape of the plot begins to fall into place when Johnny Boy's debts to Michael start to stack up. Scorsese is known for his pressure-cooker tension building and Johnny Boy acts as the foil to set this in motion. Robert De Niro plays the role with an unhinged aura (similar to that of Scorsese's cinematography) to command a fascinating screen presence. This guy really knows how to pick worthwhile characters, highlighting the tragic depths of a lonely man who has lost control of his life. Maybe Charlie (who so desperately wants control in his own life) sees himself in Johnny Boy. Maybe Charlie just wants to help him because he's in love with Johnny's sister. Regardless, their love-hate relationship continually intertwines throughout the narrative. Harvey Keitel and Bobby D have a complicated chemistry on screen that is frustrated and raw. They provide the emotional core to the movie that looks set to send our beloved Charlie down the street of despair. Charlie deserves to be recognised as one of Scorsese's most compelling characters. While his outward pressures are obvious to see there is also an internal battle he is fighting with himself. He feels ashamed for his sexual fantasies with a black woman, perhaps commenting on his sexual insecurity (as suggested in the sex scene with Teresa where he peeks through his fingers like a Peeping Tom). He also feels uncomfortable with committing to Teresa, refusing to start a proper life with her in order to please his uncle (with whom he also feels inadequate). Scorsese also sprinkles in some religious sequences in which Charlie struggles with his commitment to religion itself, contemplating his relationship with God. The only control he has over any of his relationships is his friendship with Johnny. A friendship which is set to send shockwaves through his life. Scorsese is known to pack a punch of staggering energy in his climaxes and Mean Streets might be his most viscerally powerful. The violent subtext boils and explodes into a beautifully intricate chaos of failure as Charlie finally loses the last inkling of control from his life. Johnny Boy runs down a dark alley, injured and alone, in a scene almost identical to that of Breathless' closing sequence. Teresa's hand limps from the shattered windshield. Charlie kneels by the broken fire hydrant soaked by the millions of water molecules littering the sidewalk. He thinks of his uncle and the black stripper, knowing that his multiple endeavors in life are about to collide. Charlie has been defeated by the Mean Streets. In the apartments high above these streets, locals close their blinds for another night of dreaming.
They are
Scorcese is a great director and you can tell the origins of some of his later movies in this. There are a lot of scene that feel genuine and pull you in. The characters are likeable, and the situations are relatable. However the film is all over the place in terms of plot and doesnt come to a satisfying conclusion. 63/100
I must've missed something here. Paid attention the entire film and can't figure out what happened or what the film was about.
Everything about this was intimate and dizzying and dirty and truthful and brilliant. No one can make a movie like Scorsese.
Mean Streets shows that Scorsese's skill with a camera was there from the beginning, but that his touch with a narrative needed some more time. These sort of street criminals have such inherently dramatic lives, it does not take much to find their drama, which both hurts and helps the film.
"Violence floated in and out of our lives like the music we heard on the streets." - Martin Scorsese Boy he sure is Catholic.
If you want to watch a master director laying the foundation for decades of greatness, watch this movie. Yet another reminder that De Niro is, and always, will be, the Man.
This isn't a film you'll enjoy on its own merits if you've watched a lot of Scorsese, but much like Spielberg's Amblin, it's fun to watch a young director slowly grow into their particular tics and habits as a filmmaker and a lot of that is already there. The slow boom in to one of Scorsese's favorite songs, the aggressive camera movement, the toxic masculinity and the Catholic guilt. Quite a bit of it is already there. It's an inconsequential thing, but it wasn't back then. Such a narrative back then was damn near revolutionary, and that's worth remembering. You can watch a very young Robert De Niro and Harvey Keitel and see the raw talent they had before they compromised themselves, and see just how goddamn good they can be. It's a masterclass in microexpressions with the both of them. Scorsese wouldn't hit peak form until Taxi Driver, but in hindsight, it seems almost inevitable that he would.
Letterboxd: We’ve got a movie you cannot say no to. Me: No. Letterboxd: ...He said no.
Yes, I hate films with extreme violence, toxic masculinity, racism, misogyny, and homophobia. Yes, I love Mean Streets and consider it my ultimate comfort movie. We exist 😔
Came in when David Carradine got shot while just trying to drunkenly have a squirt. And... Of course I have to watch it to the end.
literally all of charlie’s problems would’ve been solved if johnny’s disaster gay bitchass would just shut the fuck up (i wish i could be spared of the casual racism but this is what happens when you watch 70’s mob films!) (i would unapologetically let harvey keitel bend me over a table ngl)
I am a little flumix why I had not seen this movie yet. In many ways it was like seeing a rosetta stone and seeing how film DNA has intwined and melded together over the last 45 years. Okay, I'm not entirely sure those two metaphores worked together but you get what I mean. And it's not just what Taratino did with it in the 90s, more how with this third movie Scorsese shaped movies in general. It's in very board strokes and part of a larger indepentant movement that was already happened in the early 70s. But you take this movie out of film history and it looks very different. I always knew how important Scorsese was, now I see him in a very differentent light and how this movie has never really let him go. I get that Goodfellas (a movie I adore, and I will generally drop what I am doing and watch it if I come across it - where's the money Karen) is a more polished more drawn out epic version of Mean Streets. Watching Mean Streets, I kept on wondering what would have happened if Keitel had De Niro's career. Cause Keitel is giving everything he has in this movie, and I mean everything. I don't think anyone else could have played Jake LaMottam, but Travis Bickle, maybe Jimmy Conway (though I will give maybe too similar in body shape to Pesci, small and weasely). Personally I just found it odd that is was De Niro that really popped. Maybe because you maybe see to much of Keitel's work on the page as it were. Anyway I really liked the movie.
Johnny Boy is slightly underwritten, I think, but man, De Niro doesn’t let that get in the way of anything. Wow.
“Wuzzuh madda wit’ chu?” The only dialog Scorsese likes more than the F Bomb. The first really poorly made Scorsese film I’d seen. I was hoping if Goodfellas was his pulp fiction this would be his reservoir dogs, but that’s not it. If Goodfellas is a really good movie with some scenes in a bar, this is just a film set in a bar. The moral of this story is don’t help those who can’t help themselves. That’s really evident. I don't think anybody else is saying that though, which is confusing to me. De Niro is the one who can't help himself. He is without redemption. He is neither competent nor likable in any way. You can tell De Niro is no good from his opening intro. We get a quick scene of him blowing up a mailbox and running away, ‘Johnny Boy’ appears on screen then it cuts somewhere else. It's really jarring that we had such a brief scene to introduce a champion like De Niro. What's up, Scorsese, you couldnt build that into something else? But the intro does its job: I know there is nothing redeeming about this character. Keitel keeps sticking up for De Niro, the film never explicitly states why, and the film seems to punish him at the end for his altruism. There isn't enough else to go on. That's clearly the point of the movie. I dont know what Keitel wants in this film. His uncles restaurant is clearly a macguffin and he doesnt want Teresa. When Keitel has his character introduced hes fantasizing about a black dancer at the bar, who he sets up a date with later. He chickens out right before the date, but has visions of her again at the end of the film. She clearly represents something he wants, but not enough (I think she represents something anti-Italian). It seems like he wants De Niro, but its not clear why. It never seems sexual, but maybe im missing that facet. Otherwise, he's just being Catholic and trying to protect De Niro, which the film punishes him for. So that's the point of the film. It's actually slightly anti-Catholic, in that it punishes Keitel for trying to do something in line with his faith. The film is full of sexist, racist, homophobic, unlikable characters with huge scenes dedicated to establishing those character traits. Its tough to make a good movie out of unlikable characters and this film doesnt succeed. These character traits also arent important in any way. That definitely counts as a weakness. Theres one good bar fight in this movie, but there are so many other bad ones that ive already forgotten why it was good. This is basically 'Bar Fight' the movie. Scorsese has impeccable taste in music, but when totally unrestrained in selection, as in this film, it starts to lose meaning. The music so saturated this film that the audience stops thinking about it. It becomes a distraction. It distracts to the point where you’d like to say to someone “can you turn down the music? I’m trying to watch a movie”. This film has is also indulgent in establishing shots. The exteriors of the bar are never necessary, I know it’s the bar, the whole movie is set there. I get that Scorsese loves NYC as much as anyone but there’s no good reason to have as many generic shots in an already bloated run time. Another example is the opening of the movie with a couple seconds of a guy getting out of bed before cutting to the credits. That was completely unnecessary, unmoving imagery when you could have just started with credits. The bloated run time is not assisted by extremely repetitive dialog. Also unimaginative dialog. Some of these lines are meant to be clever, but they aren’t. Like when Keitel offers up a prayer, and the others mock him, saying “you talking to yourself?” And laughing. This line isn’t worth including, and its not a funny way to establish that no one else shares his faith. And considering how important his faith is to him this is too late to establish no one else believes. Not to mention in this scene we keep careening between dialog in the car to establishing shots of driving. I can’t imagine a worse more boring way of handling this.
Early Scorsese films like this just have a raw, honest and tightly instinctive feel to them. I like it a lot!
de niro invented acting
Only watched this cos Arctic Monkeys sing about it and I’ll slightly disappointed in my boyfriend, Alex Turner, for making such a vague reference
This has such an awesome, kinetic energy to it that I haven’t really seen in other Scorsese films. Rather than use a structured narrative like Goodfellas or Casino to tell its story, Mean Streets is incredibly free-form and uses this to its advantage, when conflict happens it almost always hits you right over the head because the structure of this film constantly keeps bouncing around, and while that might not be some people’s cup of tea (as they might see this as unfocused or amateur) I absolutely loved it.
What a boring fucking movie. IMDb describes this being about a guy who's trying to work his way up in the ranks of the mob, but I didn't get that at all, it seemed to be more about Harvey Keitel as an uninteresting plain guy with a bad friend who borrows too much money (which I guess is supposed to be the main character arc?) and an uninteresting side plot involving some broad. I barely made it through
What a powerful debut for Scorsese. His incredible use of music and the huge performances by DeNiro and Keitel make this film a must-see.
This is the movie where de niro takes acting to a whole new level. Also 10 DOLLAS
Sometimes, I feel like Martin Scorsese's ability to compose a scene sometimes takes precedence over his ability to meaningfully and seamlessly connect one scene to the next. Don't get me wrong, he's fantastic at composing scenes, and Mean Streets, but there's a tendency in some of his films, now evidently precedent from his first features to the likes of The Wolf of Wall Street and Silence, to come across as more of a montage of similar events under the guise of a character study, an approach which works incredibly well in certain circumstances, less so in others, but never outright bad. Scorsese is exceptional at narrowing the scope of his films to converge around his characters. He creates environments in which the world literally does revolved around them, so by default, they become the most fascinating aspects of his films. The camera follows closely behind them as they move from place to place, circles around them with a predator-like fixation during action scenes, and there's a shot in Mean Streets, a steadicam shot of Harvey Keitel's face as drunkenly stumbles around a party, that is almost impossibly good. His use of music is quite frankly all the context he needs; Such is the skill and precision with which he implements it. When Mean Streets has this sight, it's great, but the unfortunate reality is that it doesn't have this sight at all times. The alternating focus on Charlie Cappa and Johnny Boy feels like two different movies occasionally converging rather than a single film with two main characters. The film isn't presented in such a way that the dual narratives could be considered part of the point, and it creates occasions where a particularly exceptional scene focused on one of the characters is interrupted by a more stagnant scene taking place between both of them. (High) 7 / 10 - Good
Love the relationship between Johnny-boy and Charlie, it really brings an original element to what could otherwise be an orthodox Scorsese gangster flick (although on a much more personal and minuscule scale).
I’m too gay to appreciate these Scorsese movies.
Although DeNiro's performance does shine through, especially in the final act, and it does set the pace for the rest of Scorsese's iconic filmography, "Mean Streets" is still an early film from a young writer/director, and it shows. From the messy writing to the wildly spastic pacing of the film, it shows too many cracks for me to truly recommend it as a "good" film rather than something important to see, because it show's that even master filmmakers have rough and humble beginnings. It's "Baddabing: The Movie", and is pretty much the Boondock Saints of the 70s
Just because it's authentic to the toxic, alcoholic 1970's NYC asshole experience doesn't mean it's good. Tell me with a straight face that the racist, homophobic ugliness is essential to verisimilitude and understanding "what it was really like" when the bulk of the movie was shot in Los Angeles.
Why was this rated R18+?
Mean Streets is a strong debut Scorsese, with two great central performances from DeNiro and Keitel. It's always really great to see a director establish themselves so early on in their career, and Scorsese definitely does that here, with amazing frantic camera work constantly at play, especially in one bar fight scene. I have to say though, it takes a really long time for Mean Streets to establish its characters and their relationships, it's a great conclusion but the setup is far too long, still a really strong debut from Scorsese.
Birth Year Challenge - #9 of 45 We've all had that one friend that will drag you down with them if you don't cut them the f**k loose. As per the rules, this was my first time watching this from start to finish. Hard to believe it turns 45 next month. You can clearly see the foundations of what Scorsese would build his career on. Give him a better budget, more editing skills, and some improved sound mixing, and you have a film that fits in perfectly with Good Fellas and Casino. Since I've never really been around that culture or even in New York, I gotta ask how genuine the performances are. Help me out, folks: sincere or scenery chewing? Tell me in the comments.
The most blatantly "early" film of maybe any director I've watched. There's moments of excellence here, particularly in the latter half. Keitel and De Niro really carry the film, as do most of the supporting stuff; there's a great, light sense of flowing dialogue throughout the film. It just feels like a bunch of guys shooting the stuff, so to speak, for a while, and it's entertaining just by itself. But the first half alone suffers from some technical limitations - the film feels cheap every other or maybe every third scene, and it feels bizarre every time. The camerawork feels just very inexperienced, and the cast can't carry everything on their own. There's some nicer stuff in the 2nd half, but the movie ultimately falls short of reaching its potential due to Scorcese's inability to really drive home theme. There's some clear elements going on here - the constant music/movie motif, the catholic repentance bit, there's ideas here that just remain ideas. By the end of the film, I don't truly feel like much happened, and I don't feel like what did happen holds much significance. I don't even get that Coen brothers type sense of nihilism, just incompletion.
The earliest of his movies I have seen yet, and definitely a rough diamond. The performances are excellent. The music as usual is used perfectly. The cinematography is surreal. But it didn't grab me immediately like the rest of Scorsese's films. I also understand the time period but don't like the racism or the unnecessary scene full of homophobia. De Niro is fucking captivating.
"You don't make up for your sins in church. You do it in the streets. You do it at home. The rest is bullshit and you know it."  Mean Streets was actually Martin Scorsese's third feature film. I'm a humongous Martin Scorsese fan and I've loved almost all his films. Unfortunately, this falls in the "almost" of his feature films. There's nothing bad about this film at all. The performances are all fantastic with a both very young Harvey Keitel and Robert de Niro. My main issue was that the film didn't really feel necessary. The entire time, for me, it felt like there was nothing of importance really happening. The score also felt recycled a lot throughout the film. The cinematography is to die for though, and I'm a huge sucker for nighttime, crime thrillers. Besides a few great scenes though, I honestly found this to be more on the mediocre side of Scorsese's filmography.
“Honorable men go with honorable men”  Decent movie. Worse than “Resevoir Dogs”, obviously. Wouldn’t necessarily recommend to anybody, but might serve to be interesting for some.
Certainly an improvement from his previous work. But I'm also starting to think maybe I'm just not a huge Scorsese fan??
Decently made film containing some good acting, writing and directing with not that much else to offer. I seem to not like the old-school Martin Scorcese style. It’s just my personal preferance and I do see a well made film in this. It’s the last Scorcese film from this era I’ll be checkingout for the foreseeable future.
Martin Scorsese — Ranked Movies I've Seen on FilmStruck "The pain in hell has two sides. The kind you can touch with your hand; the kind you can feel in your heart... your soul, the spiritual side." Martin Scorsese dabbles in themes that will soon become some of his trademark ones in this early gem, a film that kicked off his wonderful relationship with Robert DeNiro and set the tone for the gangster and gritty classics that he would soon produce. Mean Streets has all the makings of a Scorsese picture most people know and love: The exquisite use of music (Johnny Boy's entrance to the club with "Jumpin' Jack Flash" playing stands out as a particularly memorable choice), flashes of creative editing and stark violence all with the familiar backdrop of the seedy side of New York City. Harvey Keitel provides the heart and soul of this movie while DeNiro is the bravado and aggression. Scorsese kind of frames this movie as a dirty, messy sort of tragedy and struggle for the redemption of the criminal soul and it works in many ways. Here, we have common Scorsese thematic tropes such as male friendships/male bonding, the criminal psyche, men (particularly young men) behaving badly and the consequences of their actions and the role of violence and its effect on masculinity in an urban setting. They're themes Scorsese has revisited many times throughout his career but Mean Streets represents an early film where Scorsese experiments in this territory and he elicits very effective performances among the ensemble of this film, particularly Kettle's tortured protagonist who is almost numb to the pain his life of crime is inflicting on him internally. DeNiro's absence in the middle section of the film puts the focus squarely on Keitel, which detracts from the film's momentum a bit, but Scorsese uses it to probe deeper into the character of Keitel's Charlie, the result being a sort of sneaky character study the way Scorsese has shown us in some of his greatest films. The film never reaches the intensity that makes the first act so electric and powerful but the film as a whole never peters out, either, it simply looks more inward and gets a bit darker until its ending, tragic climax. Throughout, Scorsese explores the dark alleys of Manhattan and the boozy clubs and bars the characters operate in, giving the film a gritty quality that the best filmmakers of the 1970s gave to their films.
This is the first Scorsese film to truly start to feel like a Scorsese film. Up til now his previous works had the makings, but just didn’t have that signature essence to it that all of his films have. The camera work and editing are amazing and fluid, the characters feel deep and real, the acting is fantastic especially from Keitel and a young De Niro, and the whole thing just feels very personal and genuine. Still a little rough around the edges, but probably Scorsese’s first really great film.
Really good character work, superb writing and energetic neorealist cinematography make this a winner for me. Very personal feeling and subjective. The editing really elevates it as well, it is clearly a very influential crime film and my initial impression is that it is the first quintessential synthesis of Scorsese.
The story is a little messy, but Scorsese's signatures are all in place - the sleek nighttime grit and glow of NYC, the ultraviolence, the stunning music choices. I really enjoyed this. Somewhere above 3.5 stars, below 4 stars.
Early Scorsese. I found it pretty nice. The story was a lil' messy imo, I got lost a few times. Anyways, great perfomances by De Niro and Keitel. De Niro was fucking hilarious.
Whats better than this? Guys being dudes
It's the second best movie to have Robert De Niro being shot in the neck in the last 5 minutes.
I don't exactly remember when I first saw this film, it must've been 3 or 4 years ago, but I do remember being disappointed and have since considered it to be my least favorite Scorsese film. Looking back, I don't really blame myself. At first glance, Mean Streets is a relatively plotless and at times amateurish crime drama mostly consisting of a bunch of Italian-American punks getting into fist-fights in Manhattan. But upon this rewatch, I've found that, of course, the film hasn't changed yet I have. The first time I saw Mean Streets, I had never walked the filthy streets of Manhattan, been to bars, owed people money, had a falling out with a friend, had relations with a girl, or even been to the Feast of San Gennaro in Little Italy. But no longer. I've had those experiences since, and have also grown to understand my Italian-American heritage through my own filmmaking. I empathize with Charlie, especially as of late, because he and I share the thematic thread prevalent in not only this film but a handful of Scorsese's work - Catholic guilt. Even a lapsed Catholic cannot evade its haunting presence; I'm not sure it ever goes away. However, Charlie's struggle to atone for his sins in a meaningful way for himself while preserving his personal morals surrounded by the Italian American community's toxic masculinity is a balancing act which is which is too damn relatable for me. This is a rare film which looks and feels all too real to me.
35mm at Film Forum NYC First time I've seen a movie projected on film, and this movie has a reallyyyyyy cool look. Love the long takes and interesting angles like the drunk scene. Wish they had done more with the "pay for your sins in the streets idea," which intrigued me the most and I think could have been built on more. I was really tired during this so I might want to rewatch at some point.
"You don't make up for your sins in church. You do it in the streets. You do it at home. The rest is bullshit and you know it. "  Robert De Niro and Martin Scorsese are the greatest director actor pairing cinema has seen or will ever see. They've made so many masterpieces, and this film started it all. Mean Streets stars De Niro alongside Harvey Keitel in the gritty, brutal, and dangerous New York City crime world, where you don't want to mess with the wrong people. This movie boasts one of Keitel's finest performances and an incredible soundtrack, just to name some of it. The vibes I got from this movie were unlike any other I've felt before, honestly once I rewatch it enough, I can see myself enjoying this more than Taxi Driver, my favorite Scorsese movie and my second (but honestly probably first) favorite movie of all time. Stop what you're doing and do yourself a favor and watch this, it'll be worth it. (Sorry I went on a lot I just really loved it I may have overhyped it lol)
damn those streets sure are mean
Watching from the 21st century, Mean Streets feels dated and a little strange. However, it still possesses a certain charm and we see the makings of the Scorsese to come, particularly evident in the scenes with tracking shots.
probably catch me at the bar trying to start a fight
Mean Streets is Scorsese before Scorsese was at his best. It's an indictment of the violent, depraved core that rumbles deep in the centre of toxic masculinity. Some people argue that Mean Streets glorifies this lifestyle, and I completely disagree. I think it's clear that Scorsese is criticising the life of these violent, petty wannabe mafiosos . I believe these critics are conflating glorification with Scorsese's presentation of a nuanced, multi-dimensional perspective that eschews the reductive dichotomy of only good and evil. By portraying the film through this perspective, the villains in this story are 'humanised' to an extent - and I think this is what makes Mean Streets a great film. Also A+ for the esoteric soundtrack.
Ayy, that’s pretty good! The cast was a really nice line-up and overall the movie was enjoyable.
Had a blast watching this movie and De Niro gives a finest performance like usual. I also enjoyed Harvey Keitel in this
A masterpiece in style, if not substance, and has some downright incredible tracking shots. Scorsese frames this film so excellently that the sub-par, and honestly kind of boring plot is a backseat to the frantic and expressive camera style. It should be noted that while I say I find the plot boring, all the acting is superb from the two leads, Harvey Keitel and Robert De Niro. Scorsese has a great color palette on this film too, and it always has this gritty hard nosed feel no matter where the characters are taken. There were also many instances of clear inspiration from French New Wave in many of the long shots and street view angles of New York City.
oh we love some good marty scorsese masculine melodrama but also frankie bones
Always a dark joy to watch. Classic Scorsese greatness.
You can see that Martin Scorsese was just starting to figure things out in “Mean Streets” — a tale of low class gangsters living in sin. The film is fascinating and has brilliant sparks, but it’s obviously lacking compared to the director’s later classics. The same could be said about Robert De Niro and Harvey Keitel, who play an explosive hot head and an implosive catholic. Scorsese finds more use for the both of them as he goes forward in his career. One aspect of “Mean Streets” that works as well as any of Scorsese’s later works is the Doo-Wop vinyl soundtrack, especially in the scenes in Little Italy dive bars where the music sounds like it's bursting out of a rusty jukebox. Those scenes, soaked in crimson light, put the viewer authentically in the core of this environment. It all feels so real and so subterranean, but again Scorsese was still just figuring it all out.
oh charlie......whatever you do, you will always be a sinner......
"You don't make up for your sins in church. You do it in the streets. You do it at home. The rest is bullshit and you know it." A pure distillation of visceral thrills and religious pre-occupation. The Catholic imagery mixed with Harvey Keitel need for a personal relationship with God, oddly protestant concern for Martin Scorsese. It is a beautifully acted film with a script edging on profundity. Harvey Keitel's Charlie is probably the most recognisable human within Martin Scorsese whole canon of film, his inability to make everything the way he wants it to be. While Johnnie Boy is the idiot we all have met, the mercurial arsehole. Someone who just cannot follow the rules, the infuriating self-destructive individual. Mean Streets is as kinetic, exciting and majestic as cinema gets. It is I Vitelloni repurposed for New York, it is low-level mafia, more focused on soul than at any point in Scorsese' career. People went crazy for The Wolf of Wall Street, and it is a good film, but that always felt like Scorsese reaching for a world he did not quite live and breathe. Mean Streets is a howl of a film, straight from the gut. Mean Streets is the dropped note in Be My Baby; it is Paragons singing Florence; it is the fight in the pool hall scored to Please Mr Postman. It is Harvey Keitel burning his fingers; his internal monologue. It is Jeannie Bell dancing. Mean Streets is Robert De Niro strolling into the bar; delivering monologues like he cannot remember the words. It is dancing around a car. It is Joey Scallops. Joey Clams. And wha'. Still the best film Martin Scorsese has made. But then, it is just about the best film anyone has ever made.
Keitel and De Niro were EXCELLENT. You can tell how Scorsese began to get creative with his shots. Loved the one where Keitel is drunk and the camera stumbles with him around the club while a pop song plays. As always the music selection is perfect. I wish the plot was more interesting.
Damn, early Scorsese is wonderful.
┳┻| ┻┳| ┳┻| ┻┳| ┳┻| ┻┳| ┳┻| ┻┳| ┳┻| ┻┳| ┳┻| ┻┳| ┳┻| _ ┻┳| •.•) This is a better film ┳┻|⊂ﾉ than Goodfellas ┻┳|
Besides the sparkling performances of Keitel and De Niro, two details make this one really special: 1. the soundtrack. Rolling Stones and the finest pieces of Neapolitan music is a match hard to beat. It shouldn't work, but it does 2. the Italian spoken in the film. It's Italian, not the stereotyped Italoamericano usually heard in movies. I've appreciated it a lot
so i'd really like the coast scene where charlie and teresa tried to work things out, and the scenes where jonny boy losing it, great three, but then i guess i wasn't really concentrating / not really know where to look at, so maybe i watch it some other day in the future, or not. and what an amazing career... scorsese, keitel and de niro. i am in awe (while reflecting on the meaning of life and time and if time is ruthless or a gift, if time is a mean street).
As one of Scorsese's first features, it's clear to see he's still finding his feet. The tone is all over the place and there's too much effort put into strange editing and disjointed story-telling. Dated as it is, this feels like the experiment Scorsese had to make to figure out a few things before making Taxi Driver. There's some good wise-guy banter, and Harvey Keitel is excellent. It's all just a bit too messy and tried too hard in a lot of ways. It's missing the weight and masterful execution of his later work, but still an interesting step along the way.
Great, great film, with some great Early Robert De Niro, who had just come fresh off The Godfather Part II. The ending ends without the main characters having a real conclusion - it’s a bit hard to say what it is, but it works strangely. This is probably my second favorite Martin Scorsese film after GoodFellas. 9/10
[thick Italian accent] hey whAT 'YA DOINg
The performances and the camera work in this film make up for everything. DeNiro is wonderful as Johnny Boy, keeping the audience entertained with his attitude. Keitel is great as Charlie, the compromiser and confidante of DeNiro and his relationship between him and Robinson is pure and greatly developed. The camera work done in the bar fight scene was so well-done and effective. Not Scorsese's best but still a great film.
young de niro is magical but this film is very clunky
A proof-of-concept for Taxi Driver and a showcase for De Niro.
I ain’t smart I’m stupid
It kind of meanders around. Lots of good scenes driven by jukebox tracks.  Young Deniro looks like Chris Meloni (law and order guy)
Robert de Niro is fantastic and Harvey Keitel gives a great performance in a great movie.
Yup, those streets sure are mean. First off, to paraphrase Hillary Duff, that intro sequence is "what dreams are made of". Not only do we immediately get a sense of each of the characters and their relationships, but we're also drawn into their world as an equal. The fake documentary style reminds a lot of people of home movies and, hoo boy, what a lovely yet horrible home dynamic. I adopted all these characters and I'm also dreading the family reunion. So many of the shots invigorate the acting. I don't think there was a single brawl where I was apathetic to the consequences (unless another character felt that way). Not only did the fights feel important, but other short sequences reinforced the narrative. This isn't a spoiler because it's literally just someone walking, but here me out. A character's nervous about impending consequences. How is this shot? Walking down a darkened street with the blinds of a nearby window serving as the main light source. He's shuffling along, keeping closer to walls than other passersby and he throws a paranoid look over his shoulder. That is so clever! We've got jail cell allusions in lighting, we know how he's feeling, we know he's not used to this, and we know he feels alone. Listen. No one asked this movie to be this smart: it just was. My only warnings are for the obvious things. It's a gangster movie made in the 70s. There's violence, nudity, profanity, and a heck of a lot of racism/homophobia. There are also a couple religious themes portrayed in a meh light? Sometimes, I found the racism/homophobia to be superfluous because it felt like an unnecessary side story, but eh. The streets are mean: I was warned. Watch it if you're into family bonding, sucky (but understandable) things happening, and good ol' gangster movies. Now you've been warned, ya mook.
Harvey Keitel & Robert De Niro play an Italian-American version of Noel & Liam Gallagher.
